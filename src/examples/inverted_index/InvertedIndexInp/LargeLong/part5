act iv
scene iv york the archbishop's palace
 enter the archbishop of york and sir michael
archbishop of york hie good sir michael bear this sealed brief
 with winged haste to the lord marshal
 this to my cousin scroop and all the rest
 to whom they are directed if you knew
 how much they do to import you would make haste
sir michael my good lord
 i guess their tenor
archbishop of york like enough you do
 tomorrow good sir michael is a day
 wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
 must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury
 as i am truly given to understand
 the king with mighty and quickraised power
 meets with lord harry and i fear sir michael
 what with the sickness of northumberland
 whose power was in the first proportion
 and what with owen glendower's absence thence
 who with them was a rated sinew too
 and comes not in o'erruled by prophecies
 i fear the power of percy is too weak
 to wage an instant trial with the king
sir michael why my good lord you need not fear
 there is douglas and lord mortimer
archbishop of york no mortimer is not there
sir michael but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy
 and there is my lord of worcester and a head
 of gallant warriors noble gentlemen
archbishop of york and so there is but yet the king hath drawn
 the special head of all the land together
 the prince of wales lord john of lancaster
 the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt
 and moe corrivals and dear men
 of estimation and command in arms
sir michael doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed
archbishop of york i hope no less yet needful tis to fear
 and to prevent the worst sir michael speed
 for if lord percy thrive not ere the king
 dismiss his power he means to visit us
 for he hath heard of our confederacy
 and tis but wisdom to make strong against him
 therefore make haste i must go write again
 to other friends and so farewell sir michael

 1 king henry iv
act v
scene i king henry iv's camp near shrewsbury
 enter king henry prince henry lord john of
 lancaster earl of westmoreland sir walter blunt
 and falstaff
king henry iv how bloodily the sun begins to peer
 above yon busky hill the day looks pale
 at his distemperature
prince henry the southern wind
 doth play the trumpet to his purposes
 and by his hollow whistling in the leaves
 foretells a tempest and a blustering day
king henry iv then with the losers let it sympathize
 for nothing can seem foul to those that win
 the trumpet sounds
 enter worcester and vernon
 how now my lord of worcester tis not well
 that you and i should meet upon such terms
 as now we meet you have deceived our trust
 and made us doff our easy robes of peace
 to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
 this is not well my lord this is not well
 what say you to it will you again unknit
 this curlish knot of allabhorred war
 and move in that obedient orb again
 where you did give a fair and natural light
 and be no more an exhaled meteor
 a prodigy of fear and a portent
 of broached mischief to the unborn times
earl of worcester hear me my liege
 for mine own part i could be well content
 to entertain the lagend of my life
 with quiet hours for i do protest
 i have not sought the day of this dislike
king henry iv you have not sought it how comes it then
falstaff rebellion lay in his way and he found it
prince henry peace chewet peace
earl of worcester it pleased your majesty to turn your looks
 of favour from myself and all our house
 and yet i must remember you my lord
 we were the first and dearest of your friends
 for you my staff of office did i break
 in richard's time and posted day and night
 to meet you on the way and kiss your hand
 when yet you were in place and in account
 nothing so strong and fortunate as i
 it was myself my brother and his son
 that brought you home and boldly did outdare
 the dangers of the time you swore to us
 and you did swear that oath at doncaster
 that you did nothing purpose gainst the state
 nor claim no further than your newfall'n right
 the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster
 to this we swore our aid but in short space
 it rain'd down fortune showering on your head
 and such a flood of greatness fell on you
 what with our help what with the absent king
 what with the injuries of a wanton time
 the seeming sufferances that you had borne
 and the contrarious winds that held the king
 so long in his unlucky irish wars
 that all in england did repute him dead
 and from this swarm of fair advantages
 you took occasion to be quickly woo'd
 to gripe the general sway into your hand
 forget your oath to us at doncaster
 and being fed by us you used us so
 as that ungentle hull the cuckoo's bird
 useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
 grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
 that even our love durst not come near your sight
 for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
 we were enforced for safety sake to fly
 out of sight and raise this present head
 whereby we stand opposed by such means
 as you yourself have forged against yourself
 by unkind usage dangerous countenance
 and violation of all faith and troth
 sworn to us in your younger enterprise
king henry iv these things indeed you have articulate
 proclaim'd at marketcrosses read in churches
 to face the garment of rebellion
 with some fine colour that may please the eye
 of fickle changelings and poor discontents
 which gape and rub the elbow at the news
 of hurlyburly innovation
 and never yet did insurrection want
 such watercolours to impaint his cause
 nor moody beggars starving for a time
 of pellmell havoc and confusion
prince henry in both your armies there is many a soul
 shall pay full dearly for this encounter
 if once they join in trial tell your nephew
 the prince of wales doth join with all the world
 in praise of henry percy by my hopes
 this present enterprise set off his head
 i do not think a braver gentleman
 more activevaliant or more valiantyoung
 more daring or more bold is now alive
 to grace this latter age with noble deeds
 for my part i may speak it to my shame
 i have a truant been to chivalry
 and so i hear he doth account me too
 yet this before my father's majesty
 i am content that he shall take the odds
 of his great name and estimation
 and will to save the blood on either side
 try fortune with him in a single fight
king henry iv and prince of wales so dare we venture thee
 albeit considerations infinite
 do make against it no good worcester no
 we love our people well even those we love
 that are misled upon your cousin's part
 and will they take the offer of our grace
 both he and they and you every man
 shall be my friend again and i'll be his
 so tell your cousin and bring me word
 what he will do but if he will not yield
 rebuke and dread correction wait on us
 and they shall do their office so be gone
 we will not now be troubled with reply
 we offer fair take it advisedly
 exeunt worcester and vernon
prince henry it will not be accepted on my life
 the douglas and the hotspur both together
 are confident against the world in arms
king henry iv hence therefore every leader to his charge
 for on their answer will we set on them
 and god befriend us as our cause is just
 exeunt all but prince henry and falstaff
falstaff hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
 me so tis a point of friendship
prince henry nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship
 say thy prayers and farewell
falstaff i would twere bedtime hal and all well
prince henry why thou owest god a death
 exit prince henry
falstaff tis not due yet i would be loath to pay him before
 his day what need i be so forward with him that
 calls not on me well tis no matter honour pricks
 me on yea but how if honour prick me off when i
 come on how then can honour set to a leg no or
 an arm no or take away the grief of a wound no
 honour hath no skill in surgery then no what is
 honour a word what is in that word honour what
 is that honour air a trim reckoning who hath it
 he that died o wednesday doth he feel it no
 doth he hear it no tis insensible then yea
 to the dead but will it not live with the living
 no why detraction will not suffer it therefore
 i'll none of it honour is a mere scutcheon and so
 ends my catechism

act v
scene ii the rebel camp
 enter worcester and vernon
earl of worcester o no my nephew must not know sir richard
 the liberal and kind offer of the king
vernon twere best he did
earl of worcester then are we all undone
 it is not possible it cannot be
 the king should keep his word in loving us
 he will suspect us still and find a time
 to punish this offence in other faults
 suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
 for treason is but trusted like the fox
 who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up
 will have a wild trick of his ancestors
 look how we can or sad or merrily
 interpretation will misquote our looks
 and we shall feed like oxen at a stall
 the better cherish'd still the nearer death
 my nephew's trespass may be well forgot
 it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
 and an adopted name of privilege
 a hairbrain'd hotspur govern'd by a spleen
 all his offences live upon my head
 and on his father's we did train him on
 and his corruption being ta'en from us
 we as the spring of all shall pay for all
 therefore good cousin let not harry know
 in any case the offer of the king
vernon deliver what you will i'll say tis so
 here comes your cousin
 enter hotspur and douglas
hotspur my uncle is return'd
 deliver up my lord of westmoreland
 uncle what news
earl of worcester the king will bid you battle presently
earl of douglas defy him by the lord of westmoreland
hotspur lord douglas go you and tell him so
earl of douglas marry and shall and very willingly
 exit
earl of worcester there is no seeming mercy in the king
hotspur did you beg any god forbid
earl of worcester i told him gently of our grievances
 of his oathbreaking which he mended thus
 by now forswearing that he is forsworn
 he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge
 with haughty arms this hateful name in us
 reenter the earl of douglas
earl of douglas arm gentlemen to arms for i have thrown
 a brave defiance in king henry's teeth
 and westmoreland that was engaged did bear it
 which cannot choose but bring him quickly on
earl of worcester the prince of wales stepp'd forth before the king
 and nephew challenged you to single fight
hotspur o would the quarrel lay upon our heads
 and that no man might draw short breath today
 but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me
 how show'd his tasking seem'd it in contempt
vernon no by my soul i never in my life
 did hear a challenge urged more modestly
 unless a brother should a brother dare
 to gentle exercise and proof of arms
 he gave you all the duties of a man
 trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue
 spoke to your deservings like a chronicle
 making you ever better than his praise
 by still dispraising praise valued in you
 and which became him like a prince indeed
 he made a blushing cital of himself
 and chid his truant youth with such a grace
 as if he master'd there a double spirit
 of teaching and of learning instantly
 there did he pause but let me tell the world
 if he outlive the envy of this day
 england did never owe so sweet a hope
 so much misconstrued in his wantonness
hotspur cousin i think thou art enamoured
 on his follies never did i hear
 of any prince so wild a libertine
 but be he as he will yet once ere night
 i will embrace him with a soldier's arm
 that he shall shrink under my courtesy
 arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
 better consider what you have to do
 than i that have not well the gift of tongue
 can lift your blood up with persuasion
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord here are letters for you
hotspur i cannot read them now
 o gentlemen the time of life is short
 to spend that shortness basely were too long
 if life did ride upon a dial's point
 still ending at the arrival of an hour
 an if we live we live to tread on kings
 if die brave death when princes die with us
 now for our consciences the arms are fair
 when the intent of bearing them is just
 enter another messenger
messenger my lord prepare the king comes on apace
hotspur i thank him that he cuts me from my tale
 for i profess not talking only this
 let each man do his best and here draw i
 a sword whose temper i intend to stain
 with the best blood that i can meet withal
 in the adventure of this perilous day
 now esperance percy and set on
 sound all the lofty instruments of war
 and by that music let us all embrace
 for heaven to earth some of us never shall
 a second time do such a courtesy

 so many of his shadows thou hast met
 and not the very king i have two boys
 seek percy and thyself about the field
 but seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily
 i will assay thee so defend thyself

king henry iv stay and breathe awhile
 thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion
 and show'd thou makest some tender of my life
 in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me
prince henry o god they did me too much injury
 that ever said i hearken'd for your death
 if it were so i might have let alone
 the insulting hand of douglas over you
 which would have been as speedy in your end
 as all the poisonous potions in the world
 and saved the treacherous labour of your son

prince henry thou speak'st as if i would deny my name
hotspur my name is harry percy
prince henry why then i see
 a very valiant rebel of the name

 to share with me in glory any more
 two stars keep not their motion in one sphere
 nor can one england brook a double reign
 of harry percy and the prince of wales
hotspur nor shall it harry for the hour is come
 to end the one of us and would to god
 thy name in arms were now as great as mine
prince henry i'll make it greater ere i part from thee
 and all the budding honours on thy crest
 i'll crop to make a garland for my head
hotspur i can no longer brook thy vanities

 boy's play here i can tell you
 reenter douglas he fights with falstaff
 who falls down as if he were dead and exit
 douglas hotspur is wounded and falls
hotspur o harry thou hast robb'd me of my youth
 i better brook the loss of brittle life
 than those proud titles thou hast won of me
 they wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh
 but thought's the slave of life and life time's fool
 and time that takes survey of all the world
 must have a stop o i could prophesy
 but that the earthy and cold hand of death
 lies on my tongue no percy thou art dust
 and food for
 dies
prince henry for worms brave percy fare thee well great heart
 illweaved ambition how much art thou shrunk
 when that this body did contain a spirit
 a kingdom for it was too small a bound
 but now two paces of the vilest earth
 is room enough this earth that bears thee dead
 bears not alive so stout a gentleman
 if thou wert sensible of courtesy
 i should not make so dear a show of zeal
 but let my favours hide thy mangled face
 and even in thy behalf i'll thank myself
 for doing these fair rites of tenderness
 adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
 thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
 but not remember'd in thy epitaph
 he spieth falstaff on the ground
 what old acquaintance could not all this flesh
 keep in a little life poor jack farewell
 i could have better spared a better man
 o i should have a heavy miss of thee
 if i were much in love with vanity
 death hath not struck so fat a deer today
 though many dearer in this bloody fray
 embowell'd will i see thee by and by
 till then in blood by noble percy lie
 exit prince henry
falstaff rising up embowelled if thou embowel me today
 i'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
 tomorrow sblood'twas time to counterfeit or
 that hot termagant scot had paid me scot and lot too
 counterfeit i lie i am no counterfeit to die
 is to be a counterfeit for he is but the
 counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man
 but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
 liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and
 perfect image of life indeed the better part of
 valour is discretion in the which better part i
 have saved my life'zounds i am afraid of this
 gunpowder percy though he be dead how if he
 should counterfeit too and rise by my faith i am
 afraid he would prove the better counterfeit
 therefore i'll make him sure yea and i'll swear i
 killed him why may not he rise as well as i
 nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me
 therefore sirrah
 stabbing him
 with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me

 reenter prince henry and lord john of lancaster
prince henry come brother john full bravely hast thou flesh'd
 thy maiden sword
lancaster but soft whom have we here
 did you not tell me this fat man was dead
prince henry i did i saw him dead
 breathless and bleeding on the ground art
 thou alive
 or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight
 i prithee speak we will not trust our eyes
 without our ears thou art not what thou seem'st
falstaff no that's certain i am not a double man but if i
 be not jack falstaff then am i a jack there is percy
 throwing the body down
 if your father will do me any honour so if not let
 him kill the next percy himself i look to be either
 earl or duke i can assure you
prince henry why percy i killed myself and saw thee dead
falstaff didst thou lord lord how this world is given to
 lying i grant you i was down and out of breath
 and so was he but we rose both at an instant and
 fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock if i may be
 believed so if not let them that should reward
 valour bear the sin upon their own heads i'll take
 it upon my death i gave him this wound in the
 thigh if the man were alive and would deny it
 zounds i would make him eat a piece of my sword
lancaster this is the strangest tale that ever i heard
prince henry this is the strangest fellow brother john
 come bring your luggage nobly on your back
 for my part if a lie may do thee grace
 i'll gild it with the happiest terms i have
 a retreat is sounded
 the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
 come brother let us to the highest of the field

 king henry the fifth too famous to live long
 england ne'er lost a king of so much worth
gloucester england ne'er had a king until his time
 virtue he had deserving to command
 his brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams
 his arms spread wider than a dragon's wings
 his sparking eyes replete with wrathful fire
 more dazzled and drove back his enemies
 than midday sun fierce bent against their faces

exeter we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
 henry is dead and never shall revive
 upon a wooden coffin we attend

 and whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought
 you are disputing of your generals
 one would have lingering wars with little cost
 another would fly swift but wanteth wings
 a third thinks without expense at all
 by guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd
 awake awake english nobility
 let not sloth dim your horrors newbegot
 cropp'd are the flowerdeluces in your arms
 of england's coat one half is cut away
exeter were our tears wanting to this funeral
 these tidings would call forth their flowing tides

 away with these disgraceful wailing robes
 wounds will i lend the french instead of eyes
 to weep their intermissive miseries
 enter to them another messenger
messenger lords view these letters full of bad mischance
 france is revolted from the english quite

 an army have i muster'd in my thoughts
 wherewith already france is overrun
 enter another messenger
messenger my gracious lords to add to your laments
 wherewith you now bedew king henry's hearse
 i must inform you of a dismal fight
 betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french
bishop
of winchester what wherein talbot overcame is't so
messenger o no wherein lord talbot was o'erthrown
 the circumstance i'll tell you more at large
 the tenth of august last this dreadful lord
 retiring from the siege of orleans
 having full scarce six thousand in his troop
 by three and twenty thousand of the french
 was round encompassed and set upon
 no leisure had he to enrank his men
 he wanted pikes to set before his archers
 instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
 they pitched in the ground confusedly
 to keep the horsemen off from breaking in
 more than three hours the fight continued
 where valiant talbot above human thought
 enacted wonders with his sword and lance
 hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
 here there and every where enraged he flew
 the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms
 all the whole army stood agazed on him
 his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
 a talbot a talbot cried out amain
 and rush'd into the bowels of the battle
 here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
 if sir john fastolfe had not play'd the coward
 he being in the vaward placed behind
 with purpose to relieve and follow them
 cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
 hence grew the general wreck and massacre
 enclosed were they with their enemies
 a base walloon to win the dauphin's grace
 thrust talbot with a spear into the back
 whom all france with their chief assembled strength
 durst not presume to look once in the face
bedford is talbot slain then i will slay myself
 for living idly here in pomp and ease
 whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
 unto his dastard foemen is betray'd
messenger o no he lives but is took prisoner
 and lord scales with him and lord hungerford
 most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise
bedford his ransom there is none but i shall pay
 i'll hale the dauphin headlong from his throne
 his crown shall be the ransom of my friend
 four of their lords i'll change for one of ours
 farewell my masters to my task will i
 bonfires in france forthwith i am to make
 to keep our great saint george's feast withal
 ten thousand soldiers with me i will take
 whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake
messenger so you had need for orleans is besieged
 the english army is grown weak and faint
 the earl of salisbury craveth supply
 and hardly keeps his men from mutiny
 since they so few watch such a multitude
exeter remember lords your oaths to henry sworn
 either to quell the dauphin utterly
 or bring him in obedience to your yoke
bedford i do remember it and here take my leave
 to go about my preparation
 exit

 reignier marching with drum and soldiers
charles mars his true moving even as in the heavens
 so in the earth to this day is not known
 late did he shine upon the english side
 now we are victors upon us he smiles
 what towns of any moment but we have
 at pleasure here we lie near orleans
 otherwhiles the famish'd english like pale ghosts
 faintly besiege us one hour in a month
alencon they want their porridge and their fat bullbeeves
 either they must be dieted like mules
 and have their provender tied to their mouths
 or piteous they will look like drowned mice
reignier let's raise the siege why live we idly here
 talbot is taken whom we wont to fear
 remaineth none but madbrain'd salisbury
 and he may well in fretting spend his gall
 nor men nor money hath he to make war
charles sound sound alarum we will rush on them
 now for the honour of the forlorn french
 him i forgive my death that killeth me
 when he sees me go back one foot or fly
 exeunt
 here alarum they are beaten back by the english
 with great loss reenter charles alencon and reignier
charles who ever saw the like what men have i
 dogs cowards dastards i would ne'er have fled
 but that they left me midst my enemies
reignier salisbury is a desperate homicide
 he fighteth as one weary of his life
 the other lords like lions wanting food
 do rush upon us as their hungry prey
alencon froissart a countryman of ours records
 england all olivers and rowlands bred
 during the time edward the third did reign
 more truly now may this be verified
 for none but samsons and goliases
 it sendeth forth to skirmish one to ten
 lean rawboned rascals who would e'er suppose
 they had such courage and audacity
charles let's leave this town for they are harebrain'd slaves
 and hunger will enforce them to be more eager
 of old i know them rather with their teeth
 the walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege
reignier i think by some odd gimmors or device
 their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on
 else ne'er could they hold out so as they do
 by my consent we'll even let them alone
alencon be it so
 enter the bastard of orleans
bastard of orleans where's the prince dauphin i have news for him
charles bastard of orleans thrice welcome to us
bastard of orleans methinks your looks are sad your cheer appall'd
 hath the late overthrow wrought this offence
 be not dismay'd for succor is at hand
 a holy maid hither with me i bring
 which by a vision sent to her from heaven
 ordained is to raise this tedious siege
 and drive the english forth the bounds of france
 the spirit of deep prophecy she hath
 exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome
 what's past and what's to come she can descry
 speak shall i call her in believe my words
 for they are certain and unfallible
charles go call her in
 exit bastard of orleans
 but first to try her skill
 reignier stand thou as dauphin in my place
 question her proudly let thy looks be stern
 by this means shall we sound what skill she hath
 reenter the bastard of orleans with joan la pucelle
reignier fair maid is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats
joan la pucelle reignier is't thou that thinkest to beguile me
 where is the dauphin come come from behind
 i know thee well though never seen before
 be not amazed there's nothing hid from me
 in private will i talk with thee apart
 stand back you lords and give us leave awhile
reignier she takes upon her bravely at first dash
joan la pucelle dauphin i am by birth a shepherd's daughter
 my wit untrain'd in any kind of art
 heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased
 to shine on my contemptible estate
 lo whilst i waited on my tender lambs
 and to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks
 god's mother deigned to appear to me
 and in a vision full of majesty
 will'd me to leave my base vocation
 and free my country from calamity
 her aid she promised and assured success
 in complete glory she reveal'd herself
 and whereas i was black and swart before
 with those clear rays which she infused on me
 that beauty am i bless'd with which you see
 ask me what question thou canst possible
 and i will answer unpremeditated
 my courage try by combat if thou darest
 and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex
 resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
 if thou receive me for thy warlike mate
charles thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms
 only this proof i'll of thy valour make
 in single combat thou shalt buckle with me
 and if thou vanquishest thy words are true
 otherwise i renounce all confidence
joan la pucelle i am prepared here is my keenedged sword
 deck'd with five flowerdeluces on each side
 the which at touraine in saint katharine's
 churchyard
 out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth
charles then come o god's name i fear no woman
joan la pucelle and while i live i'll ne'er fly from a man
 here they fight and joan la pucelle overcomes
charles stay stay thy hands thou art an amazon
 and fightest with the sword of deborah
joan la pucelle christ's mother helps me else i were too weak
charles whoe'er helps thee tis thou that must help me
 impatiently i burn with thy desire
 my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued
 excellent pucelle if thy name be so
 let me thy servant and not sovereign be
 tis the french dauphin sueth to thee thus
joan la pucelle i must not yield to any rites of love
 for my profession's sacred from above
 when i have chased all thy foes from hence
 then will i think upon a recompense
charles meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall
reignier my lord methinks is very long in talk
alencon doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
 else ne'er could he so long protract his speech
reignier shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean
alencon he may mean more than we poor men do know
 these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues
reignier my lord where are you what devise you on
 shall we give over orleans or no
joan la pucelle why no i say distrustful recreants
 fight till the last gasp i will be your guard
charles what she says i'll confirm we'll fight it out
joan la pucelle assign'd am i to be the english scourge
 this night the siege assuredly i'll raise
 expect saint martin's summer halcyon days
 since i have entered into these wars
 glory is like a circle in the water
 which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
 till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
 with henry's death the english circle ends
 dispersed are the glories it included
 now am i like that proud insulting ship
 which caesar and his fortune bare at once
charles was mahomet inspired with a dove
 thou with an eagle art inspired then
 helen the mother of great constantine
 nor yet saint philip's daughters were like thee
 bright star of venus fall'n down on the earth
 how may i reverently worship thee enough
alencon leave off delays and let us raise the siege
reignier woman do what thou canst to save our honours
 drive them from orleans and be immortalized
charles presently we'll try come let's away about it
 no prophet will i trust if she prove false

mastergunner but now thou shalt not be thou ruled by me
 chief mastergunner am i of this town
 something i must do to procure me grace
 the prince's espials have informed me
 how the english in the suburbs close intrench'd
 wont through a secret grate of iron bars
 in yonder tower to overpeer the city
 and thence discover how with most advantage
 they may vex us with shot or with assault
 to intercept this inconvenience
 a piece of ordnance gainst it i have placed
 and even these three days have i watch'd

 now do thou watch for i can stay no longer

 how wert thou handled being prisoner
 or by what means got'st thou to be released
 discourse i prithee on this turret's top
talbot the duke of bedford had a prisoner
 call'd the brave lord ponton de santrailles
 for him was i exchanged and ransomed
 but with a baser man of arms by far
 once in contempt they would have barter'd me
 which i disdaining scorn'd and craved death
 rather than i would be so vile esteem'd
 in fine redeem'd i was as i desired
 but o the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart
 whom with my bare fists i would execute
 if i now had him brought into my power
salisbury yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd
talbot with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
 in open marketplace produced they me
 to be a public spectacle to all
 here said they is the terror of the french
 the scarecrow that affrights our children so
 then broke i from the officers that led me
 and with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
 to hurl at the beholders of my shame
 my grisly countenance made others fly
 none durst come near for fear of sudden death
 in iron walls they deem'd me not secure
 so great fear of my name mongst them was spread
 that they supposed i could rend bars of steel
 and spurn in pieces posts of adamant
 wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had
 that walked about me every minutewhile
 and if i did but stir out of my bed
 ready they were to shoot me to the heart
 enter the boy with a linstock
salisbury i grieve to hear what torments you endured
 but we will be revenged sufficiently
 now it is suppertime in orleans
 here through this grate i count each one
 and view the frenchmen how they fortify
 let us look in the sight will much delight thee
 sir thomas gargrave and sir william glansdale
 let me have your express opinions
 where is best place to make our battery next
gargrave i think at the north gate for there stand lords
glansdale and i here at the bulwark of the bridge
talbot for aught i see this city must be famish'd
 or with light skirmishes enfeebled
 here they shoot salisbury and gargrave fall
salisbury o lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
gargrave o lord have mercy on me woful man
talbot what chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us
 speak salisbury at least if thou canst speak
 how farest thou mirror of all martial men
 one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off
 accursed tower accursed fatal hand
 that hath contrived this woful tragedy
 in thirteen battles salisbury o'ercame
 henry the fifth he first train'd to the wars
 whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
 his sword did ne'er leave striking in the field
 yet livest thou salisbury though thy speech doth fail
 one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace
 the sun with one eye vieweth all the world
 heaven be thou gracious to none alive
 if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
 bear hence his body i will help to bury it
 sir thomas gargrave hast thou any life
 speak unto talbot nay look up to him
 salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort
 thou shalt not die whiles
 he beckons with his hand and smiles on me
 as who should say when i am dead and gone
 remember to avenge me on the french'
 plantagenet i will and like thee nero

 that now our loss might be ten times so much

 at all times will you have my power alike
 sleeping or waking must i still prevail
 or will you blame and lay the fault on me
 improvident soldiers had your watch been good
 this sudden mischief never could have fall'n
charles duke of alencon this was your default
 that being captain of the watch tonight
 did look no better to that weighty charge
alencon had all your quarters been as safely kept
 as that whereof i had the government
 we had not been thus shamefully surprised
bastard of orleans mine was secure
reignier and so was mine my lord
charles and for myself most part of all this night
 within her quarter and mine own precinct
 i was employ'd in passing to and fro
 about relieving of the sentinels
 then how or which way should they first break in
joan la pucelle question my lords no further of the case
 how or which way tis sure they found some place
 but weakly guarded where the breach was made
 and now there rests no other shift but this
 to gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispersed
 and lay new platforms to endamage them
 alarum enter an english soldier crying a

messenger the virtuous lady countess of auvergne
 with modesty admiring thy renown
 by me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
 to visit her poor castle where she lies
 that she may boast she hath beheld the man
 whose glory fills the world with loud report
burgundy is it even so nay then i see our wars
 will turn unto a peaceful comic sport
 when ladies crave to be encounter'd with
 you may not my lord despise her gentle suit
talbot ne'er trust me then for when a world of men
 could not prevail with all their oratory
 yet hath a woman's kindness overruled
 and therefore tell her i return great thanks
 and in submission will attend on her
 will not your honours bear me company
bedford no truly it is more than manners will
 and i have heard it said unbidden guests
 are often welcomest when they are gone
talbot well then alone since there's no remedy
 i mean to prove this lady's courtesy
 come hither captain

 and when you have done so bring the keys to me
porter madam i will
 exit
countess
of auvergne the plot is laid if all things fall out right
 i shall as famous be by this exploit
 as scythian tomyris by cyrus death
 great is the rumor of this dreadful knight
 and his achievements of no less account
 fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
 to give their censure of these rare reports
 enter messenger and talbot
messenger madam
 according as your ladyship desired
 by message craved so is lord talbot come
countess
of auvergne and he is welcome what is this the man
messenger madam it is
countess
of auvergne is this the scourge of france
 is this the talbot so much fear'd abroad
 that with his name the mothers still their babes
 i see report is fabulous and false
 i thought i should have seen some hercules
 a second hector for his grim aspect
 and large proportion of his strongknit limbs
 alas this is a child a silly dwarf
 it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
 should strike such terror to his enemies
talbot madam i have been bold to trouble you
 but since your ladyship is not at leisure
 i'll sort some other time to visit you
countess
of auvergne what means he now go ask him whither he goes
messenger stay my lord talbot for my lady craves
 to know the cause of your abrupt departure
talbot marry for that she's in a wrong belief
 i go to certify her talbot's here
 reenter porter with keys
countess
of auvergne if thou be he then art thou prisoner
talbot prisoner to whom
countess
of auvergne to me bloodthirsty lord
 and for that cause i trained thee to my house
 long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
 for in my gallery thy picture hangs
 but now the substance shall endure the like
 and i will chain these legs and arms of thine
 that hast by tyranny these many years
 wasted our country slain our citizens
 and sent our sons and husbands captivate
talbot ha ha ha
countess
of auvergne laughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to moan
talbot i laugh to see your ladyship so fond
 to think that you have aught but talbot's shadow
 whereon to practise your severity
countess
of auvergne why art not thou the man
talbot i am indeed
countess
of auvergne then have i substance too
talbot no no i am but shadow of myself
 you are deceived my substance is not here
 for what you see is but the smallest part
 and least proportion of humanity
 i tell you madam were the whole frame here
 it is of such a spacious lofty pitch
 your roof were not sufficient to contain't
countess
of auvergne this is a riddling merchant for the nonce
 he will be here and yet he is not here
 how can these contrarieties agree
talbot that will i show you presently
 winds his horn drums strike up a peal of
 ordnance enter soldiers
 how say you madam are you now persuaded
 that talbot is but shadow of himself
 these are his substance sinews arms and strength
 with which he yoketh your rebellious necks
 razeth your cities and subverts your towns
 and in a moment makes them desolate
countess
of auvergne victorious talbot pardon my abuse
 i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
 and more than may be gather'd by thy shape
 let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
 for i am sorry that with reverence
 i did not entertain thee as thou art
talbot be not dismay'd fair lady nor misconstrue
 the mind of talbot as you did mistake
 the outward composition of his body
 what you have done hath not offended me
 nor other satisfaction do i crave
 but only with your patience that we may
 taste of your wine and see what cates you have
 for soldiers stomachs always serve them well
countess
of auvergne with all my heart and think me honoured
 to feast so great a warrior in my house

scene iv london the templegarden
 enter the earls of somerset suffolk and warwick
 richard plantagenet vernon and another lawyer
richard
plantagenet great lords and gentlemen what means this silence
 dare no man answer in a case of truth
suffolk within the templehall we were too loud
 the garden here is more convenient
richard
plantagenet then say at once if i maintain'd the truth
 or else was wrangling somerset in the error
suffolk faith i have been a truant in the law
 and never yet could frame my will to it
 and therefore frame the law unto my will
somerset judge you my lord of warwick then between us
warwick between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
 between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
 between two blades which bears the better temper
 between two horses which doth bear him best
 between two girls which hath the merriest eye
 i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement
 but in these nice sharp quillets of the law
 good faith i am no wiser than a daw
richard
plantagenet tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
 the truth appears so naked on my side
 that any purblind eye may find it out
somerset and on my side it is so well apparell'd
 so clear so shining and so evident
 that it will glimmer through a blind man's eye
richard
plantagenet since you are tonguetied and so loath to speak
 in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
 let him that is a trueborn gentleman
 and stands upon the honour of his birth
 if he suppose that i have pleaded truth
 from off this brier pluck a white rose with me
somerset let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
 but dare maintain the party of the truth
 pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
warwick i love no colours and without all colour
 of base insinuating flattery
 i pluck this white rose with plantagenet
suffolk i pluck this red rose with young somerset
 and say withal i think he held the right
vernon stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
 till you conclude that he upon whose side
 the fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
 shall yield the other in the right opinion
somerset good master vernon it is well objected
 if i have fewest i subscribe in silence
richard
plantagenet and i
vernon then for the truth and plainness of the case
 i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
 giving my verdict on the white rose side
somerset prick not your finger as you pluck it off
 lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
 and fall on my side so against your will
vernon if i my lord for my opinion bleed
 opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
 and keep me on the side where still i am
somerset well well come on who else
lawyer unless my study and my books be false
 the argument you held was wrong in you
 to somerset
 in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too
richard
plantagenet now somerset where is your argument
somerset here in my scabbard meditating that
 shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
richard
plantagenet meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses
 for pale they look with fear as witnessing
 the truth on our side
somerset no plantagenet
 tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
 blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
 and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
richard
plantagenet hath not thy rose a canker somerset
somerset hath not thy rose a thorn plantagenet
richard
plantagenet ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
 whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
somerset well i'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
 that shall maintain what i have said is true
 where false plantagenet dare not be seen
richard
plantagenet now by this maiden blossom in my hand
 i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
suffolk turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet
richard
plantagenet proud pole i will and scorn both him and thee
suffolk i'll turn my part thereof into thy throat
somerset away away good william de la pole
 we grace the yeoman by conversing with him
warwick now by god's will thou wrong'st him somerset
 his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence
 third son to the third edward king of england
 spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
richard
plantagenet he bears him on the place's privilege
 or durst not for his craven heart say thus
somerset by him that made me i'll maintain my words
 on any plot of ground in christendom
 was not thy father richard earl of cambridge
 for treason executed in our late king's days
 and by his treason stand'st not thou attainted
 corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
 his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
 and till thou be restored thou art a yeoman
richard
plantagenet my father was attached not attainted
 condemn'd to die for treason but no traitor
 and that i'll prove on better men than somerset
 were growing time once ripen'd to my will
 for your partaker pole and you yourself
 i'll note you in my book of memory
 to scourge you for this apprehension
 look to it well and say you are well warn'd
somerset ah thou shalt find us ready for thee still
 and know us by these colours for thy foes
 for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
richard
plantagenet and by my soul this pale and angry rose
 as cognizance of my blooddrinking hate
 will i for ever and my faction wear
 until it wither with me to my grave
 or flourish to the height of my degree
suffolk go forward and be choked with thy ambition
 and so farewell until i meet thee next
 exit
somerset have with thee pole farewell ambitious richard
 exit
richard
plantagenet how i am braved and must perforce endure it
warwick this blot that they object against your house
 shall be wiped out in the next parliament
 call'd for the truce of winchester and gloucester
 and if thou be not then created york
 i will not live to be accounted warwick
 meantime in signal of my love to thee
 against proud somerset and william pole
 will i upon thy party wear this rose
 and here i prophesy this brawl today
 grown to this faction in the templegarden
 shall send between the red rose and the white
 a thousand souls to death and deadly night
richard
plantagenet good master vernon i am bound to you
 that you on my behalf would pluck a flower
vernon in your behalf still will i wear the same
lawyer and so will i

scene v the tower of london
 enter mortimer brought in a chair and gaolers
mortimer kind keepers of my weak decaying age
 let dying mortimer here rest himself
 even like a man new haled from the rack
 so fare my limbs with long imprisonment
 and these grey locks the pursuivants of death
 nestorlike aged in an age of care
 argue the end of edmund mortimer
 these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
 wax dim as drawing to their exigent
 weak shoulders overborne with burthening grief
 and pithless arms like to a wither'd vine
 that droops his sapless branches to the ground
 yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb
 unable to support this lump of clay
 swiftwinged with desire to get a grave
 as witting i no other comfort have
 but tell me keeper will my nephew come
first gaoler richard plantagenet my lord will come
 we sent unto the temple unto his chamber
 and answer was return'd that he will come
mortimer enough my soul shall then be satisfied
 poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
 since henry monmouth first began to reign
 before whose glory i was great in arms
 this loathsome sequestration have i had
 and even since then hath richard been obscured
 deprived of honour and inheritance
 but now the arbitrator of despairs
 just death kind umpire of men's miseries
 with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
 i would his troubles likewise were expired
 that so he might recover what was lost
 enter richard plantagenet
first gaoler my lord your loving nephew now is come
mortimer richard plantagenet my friend is he come
richard
plantagenet ay noble uncle thus ignobly used
 your nephew late despised richard comes
mortimer direct mine arms i may embrace his neck
 and in his bosom spend my latter gasp
 o tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
 that i may kindly give one fainting kiss
 and now declare sweet stem from york's great stock
 why didst thou say of late thou wert despised
richard
plantagenet first lean thine aged back against mine arm
 and in that ease i'll tell thee my disease
 this day in argument upon a case
 some words there grew twixt somerset and me
 among which terms he used his lavish tongue
 and did upbraid me with my father's death
 which obloquy set bars before my tongue
 else with the like i had requited him
 therefore good uncle for my father's sake
 in honour of a true plantagenet
 and for alliance sake declare the cause
 my father earl of cambridge lost his head
mortimer that cause fair nephew that imprison'd me
 and hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
 within a loathsome dungeon there to pine
 was cursed instrument of his decease
richard
plantagenet discover more at large what cause that was
 for i am ignorant and cannot guess
mortimer i will if that my fading breath permit
 and death approach not ere my tale be done
 henry the fourth grandfather to this king
 deposed his nephew richard edward's son
 the firstbegotten and the lawful heir
 of edward king the third of that descent
 during whose reign the percies of the north
 finding his usurpation most unjust
 endeavor'd my advancement to the throne
 the reason moved these warlike lords to this
 was for thatyoung king richard thus removed
 leaving no heir begotten of his body
 i was the next by birth and parentage
 for by my mother i derived am
 from lionel duke of clarence the third son
 to king edward the third whereas he
 from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree
 being but fourth of that heroic line
 but mark as in this haughty attempt
 they laboured to plant the rightful heir
 i lost my liberty and they their lives
 long after this when henry the fifth
 succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign
 thy father earl of cambridge then derived
 from famous edmund langley duke of york
 marrying my sister that thy mother was
 again in pity of my hard distress
 levied an army weening to redeem
 and have install'd me in the diadem
 but as the rest so fell that noble earl
 and was beheaded thus the mortimers
 in whom the tide rested were suppress'd
richard
plantagenet of which my lord your honour is the last
mortimer true and thou seest that i no issue have
 and that my fainting words do warrant death
 thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather
 but yet be wary in thy studious care
richard
plantagenet thy grave admonishments prevail with me
 but yet methinks my father's execution
 was nothing less than bloody tyranny
mortimer with silence nephew be thou politic
 strongfixed is the house of lancaster
 and like a mountain not to be removed
 but now thy uncle is removing hence
 as princes do their courts when they are cloy'd
 with long continuance in a settled place
richard
plantagenet o uncle would some part of my young years
 might but redeem the passage of your age
mortimer thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth
 which giveth many wounds when one will kill
 mourn not except thou sorrow for my good
 only give order for my funeral
 and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
 and prosperous be thy life in peace and war
 dies
richard
plantagenet and peace no war befall thy parting soul
 in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
 and like a hermit overpass'd thy days
 well i will lock his counsel in my breast
 and what i do imagine let that rest
 keepers convey him hence and i myself
 will see his burial better than his life
 exeunt gaolers bearing out the body of mortimer
 here dies the dusky torch of mortimer
 choked with ambition of the meaner sort
 and for those wrongs those bitter injuries
 which somerset hath offer'd to my house
 i doubt not but with honour to redress
 and therefore haste i to the parliament
 either to be restored to my blood
 or make my ill the advantage of my good

scene i london the parliamenthouse
 flourish enter king henry vi exeter gloucester
 warwick somerset and suffolk the bishop of
 winchester richard plantagenet and others
 gloucester offers to put up a bill bishop of
 winchester snatches it and tears it
bishop
of winchester comest thou with deep premeditated lines
 with written pamphlets studiously devised
 humphrey of gloucester if thou canst accuse
 or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge
 do it without invention suddenly
 as i with sudden and extemporal speech
 purpose to answer what thou canst object
gloucester presumptuous priest this place commands my patience
 or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me
 think not although in writing i preferr'd
 the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
 that therefore i have forged or am not able
 verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
 no prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
 thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks
 as very infants prattle of thy pride
 thou art a most pernicious usurer
 forward by nature enemy to peace
 lascivious wanton more than well beseems
 a man of thy profession and degree
 and for thy treachery what's more manifest
 in that thou laid'st a trap to take my life
 as well at london bridge as at the tower
 beside i fear me if thy thoughts were sifted
 the king thy sovereign is not quite exempt
 from envious malice of thy swelling heart
bishop
of winchester gloucester i do defy thee lords vouchsafe
 to give me hearing what i shall reply
 if i were covetous ambitious or perverse
 as he will have me how am i so poor
 or how haps it i seek not to advance
 or raise myself but keep my wonted calling
 and for dissension who preferreth peace
 more than i doexcept i be provoked
 no my good lords it is not that offends
 it is not that that hath incensed the duke
 it is because no one should sway but he
 no one but he should be about the king
 and that engenders thunder in his breast
 and makes him roar these accusations forth
 but he shall know i am as good
gloucester as good
 thou bastard of my grandfather
bishop
of winchester ay lordly sir for what are you i pray
 but one imperious in another's throne
gloucester am i not protector saucy priest
bishop
of winchester and am not i a prelate of the church
gloucester yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
 and useth it to patronage his theft
bishop
of winchester unreverent gloster
gloucester thou art reverent
 touching thy spiritual function not thy life
bishop
of winchester rome shall remedy this
warwick roam thither then
somerset my lord it were your duty to forbear
warwick ay see the bishop be not overborne
somerset methinks my lord should be religious
 and know the office that belongs to such
warwick methinks his lordship should be humbler
 it fitteth not a prelate so to plead
somerset yes when his holy state is touch'd so near
warwick state holy or unhallow'd what of that
 is not his grace protector to the king
richard
plantagenet aside plantagenet i see must hold his tongue
 lest it be said speak sirrah when you should
 must your bold verdict enter talk with lords'
 else would i have a fling at winchester
king henry vi uncles of gloucester and of winchester
 the special watchmen of our english weal
 i would prevail if prayers might prevail
 to join your hearts in love and amity
 o what a scandal is it to our crown
 that two such noble peers as ye should jar
 believe me lords my tender years can tell
 civil dissension is a viperous worm
 that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
 a noise within down with the tawnycoats'
 what tumult's this
warwick an uproar i dare warrant
 begun through malice of the bishop's men
 a noise again stones stones enter mayor
mayor o my good lords and virtuous henry
 pity the city of london pity us
 the bishop and the duke of gloucester's men
 forbidden late to carry any weapon
 have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
 and banding themselves in contrary parts
 do pelt so fast at one another's pate
 that many have their giddy brains knock'd out
 our windows are broke down in every street
 and we for fear compell'd to shut our shops
 enter servingmen in skirmish with bloody pates
king henry vi we charge you on allegiance to ourself
 to hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace
 pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife
first servingman nay if we be forbidden stones
 we'll fall to it with our teeth
second servingman do what ye dare we are as resolute
 skirmish again
gloucester you of my household leave this peevish broil
 and set this unaccustom'd fight aside
third servingman my lord we know your grace to be a man
 just and upright and for your royal birth
 inferior to none but to his majesty
 and ere that we will suffer such a prince
 so kind a father of the commonweal
 to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
 we and our wives and children all will fight
 and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes
first servingman ay and the very parings of our nails
 shall pitch a field when we are dead
 begin again
gloucester stay stay i say
 and if you love me as you say you do
 let me persuade you to forbear awhile
king henry vi o how this discord doth afflict my soul
 can you my lord of winchester behold
 my sighs and tears and will not once relent
 who should be pitiful if you be not
 or who should study to prefer a peace
 if holy churchmen take delight in broils
warwick yield my lord protector yield winchester
 except you mean with obstinate repulse
 to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
 you see what mischief and what murder too
 hath been enacted through your enmity
 then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
bishop
of winchester he shall submit or i will never yield
gloucester compassion on the king commands me stoop
 or i would see his heart out ere the priest
 should ever get that privilege of me
warwick behold my lord of winchester the duke
 hath banish'd moody discontented fury
 as by his smoothed brows it doth appear
 why look you still so stern and tragical
gloucester here winchester i offer thee my hand
king henry vi fie uncle beaufort i have heard you preach
 that malice was a great and grievous sin
 and will not you maintain the thing you teach
 but prove a chief offender in the same
warwick sweet king the bishop hath a kindly gird
 for shame my lord of winchester relent
 what shall a child instruct you what to do
bishop
of winchester well duke of gloucester i will yield to thee
 love for thy love and hand for hand i give
gloucester aside ay but i fear me with a hollow heart
 see here my friends and loving countrymen
 this token serveth for a flag of truce
 betwixt ourselves and all our followers
 so help me god as i dissemble not
bishop
of winchester aside so help me god as i intend it not
king henry vi o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester
 how joyful am i made by this contract
 away my masters trouble us no more
 but join in friendship as your lords have done
first servingman content i'll to the surgeon's
second servingman and so will i
third servingman and i will see what physic the tavern affords
 exeunt servingmen mayor &c
warwick accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
 which in the right of richard plantagenet
 we do exhibit to your majesty
gloucester well urged my lord of warwick or sweet prince
 and if your grace mark every circumstance
 you have great reason to do richard right
 especially for those occasions
 at eltham place i told your majesty
king henry vi and those occasions uncle were of force
 therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
 that richard be restored to his blood
warwick let richard be restored to his blood
 so shall his father's wrongs be recompensed
bishop
of winchester as will the rest so willeth winchester
king henry vi if richard will be true not that alone
 but all the whole inheritance i give
 that doth belong unto the house of york
 from whence you spring by lineal descent
richard
plantagenet thy humble servant vows obedience
 and humble service till the point of death
king henry vi stoop then and set your knee against my foot
 and in reguerdon of that duty done
 i gird thee with the valiant sword of york
 rise richard like a true plantagenet
 and rise created princely duke of york
richard
plantagenet and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall
 and as my duty springs so perish they
 that grudge one thought against your majesty
all welcome high prince the mighty duke of york
somerset aside perish base prince ignoble duke of york
gloucester now will it best avail your majesty
 to cross the seas and to be crown'd in france
 the presence of a king engenders love
 amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
 as it disanimates his enemies
king henry vi when gloucester says the word king henry goes
 for friendly counsel cuts off many foes
gloucester your ships already are in readiness
 sennet flourish exeunt all but exeter
exeter ay we may march in england or in france
 not seeing what is likely to ensue
 this late dissension grown betwixt the peers
 burns under feigned ashes of forged love
 and will at last break out into a flame
 as fester'd members rot but by degree
 till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
 so will this base and envious discord breed
 and now i fear that fatal prophecy
 which in the time of henry named the fifth
 was in the mouth of every sucking babe
 that henry born at monmouth should win all
 and henry born at windsor lose all
 which is so plain that exeter doth wish
 his days may finish ere that hapless time

talbot lost and recover'd in a day again
 this is a double honour burgundy
 yet heavens have glory for this victory
burgundy warlike and martial talbot burgundy
 enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
 thy noble deeds as valour's monuments
talbot thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now
 i think her old familiar is asleep
 now where's the bastard's braves and charles his gleeks
 what all amort rouen hangs her head for grief
 that such a valiant company are fled
 now will we take some order in the town
 placing therein some expert officers
 and then depart to paris to the king
 for there young henry with his nobles lie
burgundy what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy
talbot but yet before we go let's not forget
 the noble duke of bedford late deceased
 but see his exequies fulfill'd in rouen
 a braver soldier never couched lance
 a gentler heart did never sway in court
 but kings and mightiest potentates must die
 for that's the end of human misery

 enter charles the bastard of orleans alencon joan
 la pucelle and forces
joan la pucelle dismay not princes at this accident
 nor grieve that rouen is so recovered
 care is no cure but rather corrosive
 for things that are not to be remedied
 let frantic talbot triumph for a while
 and like a peacock sweep along his tail
 we'll pull his plumes and take away his train
 if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled
charles we have been guided by thee hitherto
 and of thy cunning had no diffidence
 one sudden foil shall never breed distrust
bastard of orleans search out thy wit for secret policies
 and we will make thee famous through the world
alencon we'll set thy statue in some holy place
 and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint
 employ thee then sweet virgin for our good
joan la pucelle then thus it must be this doth joan devise
 by fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
 we will entice the duke of burgundy
 to leave the talbot and to follow us
charles ay marry sweeting if we could do that
 france were no place for henry's warriors
 nor should that nation boast it so with us
 but be extirped from our provinces
alencon for ever should they be expulsed from france
 and not have title of an earldom here
joan la pucelle your honours shall perceive how i will work
 to bring this matter to the wished end
 drum sounds afar off
 hark by the sound of drum you may perceive
 their powers are marching unto parisward
 here sound an english march enter and pass over
 at a distance talbot and his forces
 there goes the talbot with his colours spread
 and all the troops of english after him
 french march enter burgundy and forces
 now in the rearward comes the duke and his
 fortune in favour makes him lag behind
 summon a parley we will talk with him
 trumpets sound a parley
charles a parley with the duke of burgundy
burgundy who craves a parley with the burgundy
joan la pucelle the princely charles of france thy countryman
burgundy what say'st thou charles for i am marching hence
charles speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words
joan la pucelle brave burgundy undoubted hope of france
 stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee
burgundy speak on but be not overtedious
joan la pucelle look on thy country look on fertile france
 and see the cities and the towns defaced
 by wasting ruin of the cruel foe
 as looks the mother on her lowly babe
 when death doth close his tender dying eyes
 see see the pining malady of france
 behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
 which thou thyself hast given her woful breast
 o turn thy edged sword another way
 strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
 one drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
 should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
 return thee therefore with a flood of tears
 and wash away thy country's stained spots
burgundy either she hath bewitch'd me with her words
 or nature makes me suddenly relent
joan la pucelle besides all french and france exclaims on thee
 doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
 who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
 that will not trust thee but for profit's sake
 when talbot hath set footing once in france
 and fashion'd thee that instrument of ill
 who then but english henry will be lord
 and thou be thrust out like a fugitive
 call we to mind and mark but this for proof
 was not the duke of orleans thy foe
 and was he not in england prisoner
 but when they heard he was thine enemy
 they set him free without his ransom paid
 in spite of burgundy and all his friends
 see then thou fight'st against thy countrymen
 and joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen
 come come return return thou wandering lord
 charles and the rest will take thee in their arms
burgundy i am vanquished these haughty words of hers
 have batter'd me like roaring cannonshot
 and made me almost yield upon my knees
 forgive me country and sweet countrymen
 and lords accept this hearty kind embrace
 my forces and my power of men are yours
 so farewell talbot i'll no longer trust thee
joan la pucelle aside done like a frenchman turn and turn again
charles welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh
bastard of orleans and doth beget new courage in our breasts
alencon pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this
 and doth deserve a coronet of gold
charles now let us on my lords and join our powers
 and seek how we may prejudice the foe

fastolfe my gracious sovereign as i rode from calais
 to haste unto your coronation
 a letter was deliver'd to my hands
 writ to your grace from the duke of burgundy
talbot shame to the duke of burgundy and thee
 i vow'd base knight when i did meet thee next
 to tear the garter from thy craven's leg
 plucking it off
 which i have done because unworthily
 thou wast installed in that high degree
 pardon me princely henry and the rest
 this dastard at the battle of patay
 when but in all i was six thousand strong
 and that the french were almost ten to one
 before we met or that a stroke was given
 like to a trusty squire did run away
 in which assault we lost twelve hundred men
 myself and divers gentlemen beside
 were there surprised and taken prisoners
 then judge great lords if i have done amiss
 or whether that such cowards ought to wear
 this ornament of knighthood yea or no
gloucester to say the truth this fact was infamous
 and ill beseeming any common man
 much more a knight a captain and a leader
talbot when first this order was ordain'd my lords
 knights of the garter were of noble birth
 valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
 such as were grown to credit by the wars
 not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
 but always resolute in most extremes
 he then that is not furnish'd in this sort
 doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
 profaning this most honourable order
 and should if i were worthy to be judge
 be quite degraded like a hedgeborn swain
 that doth presume to boast of gentle blood
king henry vi stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom
 be packing therefore thou that wast a knight
 henceforth we banish thee on pain of death
 exit fastolfe

 sent from our uncle duke of burgundy
gloucester what means his grace that he hath changed his style

 hath he forgot he is his sovereign

 pretend some alteration in good will
 what's here
 reads
 i have upon especial cause
 moved with compassion of my country's wreck
 together with the pitiful complaints
 of such as your oppression feeds upon
 forsaken your pernicious faction
 and join'd with charles the rightful king of france'
 o monstrous treachery can this be so
 that in alliance amity and oaths
 there should be found such false dissembling guile
king henry vi what doth my uncle burgundy revolt
gloucester he doth my lord and is become your foe
king henry vi is that the worst this letter doth contain
gloucester it is the worst and all my lord he writes
king henry vi why then lord talbot there shall talk with him
 and give him chastisement for this abuse
 how say you my lord are you not content
talbot content my liege yes but that i am prevented
 i should have begg'd i might have been employ'd
king henry vi then gather strength and march unto him straight
 let him perceive how ill we brook his treason

 say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim
 and wherefore crave you combat or with whom
vernon with him my lord for he hath done me wrong
basset and i with him for he hath done me wrong
king henry vi what is that wrong whereof you both complain
 first let me know and then i'll answer you
basset crossing the sea from england into france
 this fellow here with envious carping tongue
 upbraided me about the rose i wear
 saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
 did represent my master's blushing cheeks
 when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
 about a certain question in the law
 argued betwixt the duke of york and him
 with other vile and ignominious terms
 in confutation of which rude reproach
 and in defence of my lord's worthiness
 i crave the benefit of law of arms
vernon and that is my petition noble lord
 for though he seem with forged quaint conceit
 to set a gloss upon his bold intent
 yet know my lord i was provoked by him
 and he first took exceptions at this badge
 pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
 bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart
york will not this malice somerset be left
somerset your private grudge my lord of york will out
 though ne'er so cunningly you smother it
king henry vi good lord what madness rules in brainsick men
 when for so slight and frivolous a cause
 such factious emulations shall arise
 good cousins both of york and somerset
 quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace
york let this dissension first be tried by fight
 and then your highness shall command a peace
somerset the quarrel toucheth none but us alone
 betwixt ourselves let us decide it then
york there is my pledge accept it somerset
vernon nay let it rest where it began at first
basset confirm it so mine honourable lord
gloucester confirm it so confounded be your strife
 and perish ye with your audacious prate
 presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed
 with this immodest clamorous outrage
 to trouble and disturb the king and us
 and you my lords methinks you do not well
 to bear with their perverse objections
 much less to take occasion from their mouths
 to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
 let me persuade you take a better course
exeter it grieves his highness good my lords be friends
king henry vi come hither you that would be combatants
 henceforth i charge you as you love our favour
 quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
 and you my lords remember where we are
 in france amongst a fickle wavering nation
 if they perceive dissension in our looks
 and that within ourselves we disagree
 how will their grudging stomachs be provoked
 to wilful disobedience and rebel
 beside what infamy will there arise
 when foreign princes shall be certified
 that for a toy a thing of no regard
 king henry's peers and chief nobility
 destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of france
 o think upon the conquest of my father
 my tender years and let us not forego
 that for a trifle that was bought with blood
 let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
 i see no reason if i wear this rose
 putting on a red rose
 that any one should therefore be suspicious
 i more incline to somerset than york
 both are my kinsmen and i love them both
 as well they may upbraid me with my crown
 because forsooth the king of scots is crown'd
 but your discretions better can persuade
 than i am able to instruct or teach
 and therefore as we hither came in peace
 so let us still continue peace and love
 cousin of york we institute your grace
 to be our regent in these parts of france
 and good my lord of somerset unite
 your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
 and like true subjects sons of your progenitors
 go cheerfully together and digest

 this jarring discord of nobility
 this shouldering of each other in the court

 my worth unknown no loss is known in me
 upon my death the french can little boast
 in yours they will in you all hopes are lost
 flight cannot stain the honour you have won
 but mine it will that no exploit have done
 you fled for vantage everyone will swear
 but if i bow they'll say it was for fear
 there is no hope that ever i will stay
 if the first hour i shrink and run away
 here on my knee i beg mortality
 rather than life preserved with infamy

 but with a proud majestical high scorn
 he answer'd thus young talbot was not born
 to be the pillage of a giglot wench'
 so rushing in the bowels of the french
 he left me proudly as unworthy fight
burgundy doubtless he would have made a noble knight
 see where he lies inhearsed in the arms
 of the most bloody nurser of his harms
bastard of orleans hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder
 whose life was england's glory gallia's wonder
charles o no forbear for that which we have fled
 during the life let us not wrong it dead
 enter sir william lucy attended herald of the
 french preceding
lucy herald conduct me to the dauphin's tent
 to know who hath obtained the glory of the day
charles on what submissive message art thou sent
lucy submission dauphin tis a mere french word
 we english warriors wot not what it means
 i come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en
 and to survey the bodies of the dead
charles for prisoners ask'st thou hell our prison is
 but tell me whom thou seek'st
lucy but where's the great alcides of the field
 valiant lord talbot earl of shrewsbury
 created for his rare success in arms
 great earl of washford waterford and valence
 lord talbot of goodrig and urchinfield
 lord strange of blackmere lord verdun of alton
 lord cromwell of wingfield lord furnival of sheffield
 the thricevictorious lord of falconbridge
 knight of the noble order of saint george
 worthy saint michael and the golden fleece
 great marshal to henry the sixth
 of all his wars within the realm of france
joan la pucelle here is a silly stately style indeed
 the turk that two and fifty kingdoms hath
 writes not so tedious a style as this
 him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
 stinking and flyblown lies here at our feet
lucy is talbot slain the frenchmen's only scourge
 your kingdom's terror and black nemesis
 o were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd
 that i in rage might shoot them at your faces
 o that i could but call these dead to life
 it were enough to fright the realm of france
 were but his picture left amongst you here
 it would amaze the proudest of you all
 give me their bodies that i may bear them hence
 and give them burial as beseems their worth
joan la pucelle i think this upstart is old talbot's ghost
 he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit
 for god's sake let him have em to keep them here
 they would but stink and putrefy the air
charles go take their bodies hence
lucy i'll bear them hence but from their ashes shall be rear'd
 a phoenix that shall make all france afeard
charles so we be rid of them do with em what thou wilt
 and now to paris in this conquering vein
 all will be ours now bloody talbot's slain

 to draw conditions of a friendly peace
 which by my lord of winchester we mean

 for i will touch thee but with reverent hands
 i kiss these fingers for eternal peace
 and lay them gently on thy tender side
 who art thou say that i may honour thee
margaret margaret my name and daughter to a king
 the king of naples whosoe'er thou art
suffolk an earl i am and suffolk am i call'd
 be not offended nature's miracle
 thou art allotted to be ta'en by me
 so doth the swan her downy cygnets save
 keeping them prisoner underneath her wings
 yet if this servile usage once offend
 go and be free again as suffolk's friend
 she is going
 o stay i have no power to let her pass
 my hand would free her but my heart says no
 as plays the sun upon the glassy streams
 twinkling another counterfeited beam
 so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
 fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak
 i'll call for pen and ink and write my mind
 fie de la pole disable not thyself
 hast not a tongue is she not here
 wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight
 ay beauty's princely majesty is such
 confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough
margaret say earl of suffolkif thy name be so
 what ransom must i pay before i pass
 for i perceive i am thy prisoner
suffolk how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
 before thou make a trial of her love
margaret why speak'st thou not what ransom must i pay
suffolk she's beautiful and therefore to be woo'd
 she is a woman therefore to be won
margaret wilt thou accept of ransom yea or no
suffolk fond man remember that thou hast a wife
 then how can margaret be thy paramour
margaret i were best to leave him for he will not hear
suffolk there all is marr'd there lies a cooling card
margaret he talks at random sure the man is mad
suffolk and yet a dispensation may be had
margaret and yet i would that you would answer me
suffolk i'll win this lady margaret for whom
 why for my king tush that's a wooden thing
margaret he talks of wood it is some carpenter
suffolk yet so my fancy may be satisfied
 and peace established between these realms
 but there remains a scruple in that too
 for though her father be the king of naples
 duke of anjou and maine yet is he poor
 and our nobility will scorn the match
margaret hear ye captain are you not at leisure
suffolk it shall be so disdain they ne'er so much
 henry is youthful and will quickly yield
 madam i have a secret to reveal
margaret what though i be enthrall'd he seems a knight
 and will not any way dishonour me
suffolk lady vouchsafe to listen what i say
margaret perhaps i shall be rescued by the french
 and then i need not crave his courtesy
suffolk sweet madam give me a hearing in a cause
margaret tush women have been captivate ere now
suffolk lady wherefore talk you so
margaret i cry you mercy tis but quid for quo
suffolk say gentle princess would you not suppose
 your bondage happy to be made a queen
margaret to be a queen in bondage is more vile
 than is a slave in base servility
 for princes should be free
suffolk and so shall you
 if happy england's royal king be free
margaret why what concerns his freedom unto me
suffolk i'll undertake to make thee henry's queen
 to put a golden sceptre in thy hand
 and set a precious crown upon thy head
 if thou wilt condescend to be my
margaret what
suffolk his love
margaret i am unworthy to be henry's wife
suffolk no gentle madam i unworthy am
 to woo so fair a dame to be his wife
 and have no portion in the choice myself
 how say you madam are ye so content
margaret an if my father please i am content
suffolk then call our captains and our colours forth
 and madam at your father's castle walls
 we'll crave a parley to confer with him
 a parley sounded enter reignier on the walls
 see reignier see thy daughter prisoner
reignier to whom

reignier suffolk what remedy
 i am a soldier and unapt to weep
 or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness
suffolk yes there is remedy enough my lord
 consent and for thy honour give consent
 thy daughter shall be wedded to my king
 whom i with pain have woo'd and won thereto
 and this her easyheld imprisonment
 hath gained thy daughter princely liberty
reignier speaks suffolk as he thinks
suffolk fair margaret knows
 that suffolk doth not flatter face or feign
reignier upon thy princely warrant i descend
 to give thee answer of thy just demand
 exit from the walls
suffolk and here i will expect thy coming
 trumpets sound enter reignier below
reignier welcome brave earl into our territories
 command in anjou what your honour pleases
suffolk thanks reignier happy for so sweet a child
 fit to be made companion with a king
 what answer makes your grace unto my suit
reignier since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
 to be the princely bride of such a lord
 upon condition i may quietly
 enjoy mine own the country maine and anjou
 free from oppression or the stroke of war
 my daughter shall be henry's if he please
suffolk that is her ransom i deliver her
 and those two counties i will undertake
 your grace shall well and quietly enjoy
reignier and i again in henry's royal name
 as deputy unto that gracious king
 give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith
suffolk reignier of france i give thee kingly thanks
 because this is in traffic of a king
 aside
 and yet methinks i could be well content
 to be mine own attorney in this case
 i'll over then to england with this news
 and make this marriage to be solemnized
 so farewell reignier set this diamond safe
 in golden palaces as it becomes
reignier i do embrace thee as i would embrace
 the christian prince king henry were he here
margaret farewell my lord good wishes praise and prayers
 shall suffolk ever have of margaret
 going
suffolk farewell sweet madam but hark you margaret
 no princely commendations to my king
margaret such commendations as becomes a maid
 a virgin and his servant say to him
suffolk words sweetly placed and modestly directed
 but madam i must trouble you again
 no loving token to his majesty
margaret yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart
 never yet taint with love i send the king
suffolk and this withal
 kisses her
margaret that for thyself i will not so presume
 to send such peevish tokens to a king
 exeunt reignier and margaret
suffolk o wert thou for myself but suffolk stay
 thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth
 there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk
 solicit henry with her wondrous praise
 bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
 and natural graces that extinguish art
 repeat their semblance often on the seas
 that when thou comest to kneel at henry's feet
 thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder

shepherd ah joan this kills thy father's heart outright
 have i sought every country far and near
 and now it is my chance to find thee out
 must i behold thy timeless cruel death
 ah joan sweet daughter joan i'll die with thee
joan la pucelle decrepit miser base ignoble wretch
 i am descended of a gentler blood
 thou art no father nor no friend of mine
shepherd out out my lords an please you tis not so
 i did beget her all the parish knows
 her mother liveth yet can testify
 she was the first fruit of my bachelorship
warwick graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage
york this argues what her kind of life hath been
 wicked and vile and so her death concludes
shepherd fie joan that thou wilt be so obstacle
 god knows thou art a collop of my flesh
 and for thy sake have i shed many a tear
 deny me not i prithee gentle joan
joan la pucelle peasant avaunt you have suborn'd this man
 of purpose to obscure my noble birth
shepherd tis true i gave a noble to the priest
 the morn that i was wedded to her mother
 kneel down and take my blessing good my girl
 wilt thou not stoop now cursed be the time
 of thy nativity i would the milk
 thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast
 had been a little ratsbane for thy sake
 or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield
 i wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee
 dost thou deny thy father cursed drab
 o burn her burn her hanging is too good
 exit
york take her away for she hath lived too long
 to fill the world with vicious qualities
joan la pucelle first let me tell you whom you have condemn'd
 not me begotten of a shepherd swain
 but issued from the progeny of kings
 virtuous and holy chosen from above
 by inspiration of celestial grace
 to work exceeding miracles on earth
 i never had to do with wicked spirits
 but you that are polluted with your lusts
 stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents
 corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices
 because you want the grace that others have
 you judge it straight a thing impossible
 to compass wonders but by help of devils
 no misconceived joan of arc hath been
 a virgin from her tender infancy
 chaste and immaculate in very thought
 whose maiden blood thus rigorously effused
 will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven
york ay ay away with her to execution
warwick and hark ye sirs because she is a maid
 spare for no faggots let there be enow
 place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
 that so her torture may be shortened
joan la pucelle will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts
 then joan discover thine infirmity
 that warranteth by law to be thy privilege
 i am with child ye bloody homicides
 murder not then the fruit within my womb
 although ye hale me to a violent death
york now heaven forfend the holy maid with child
warwick the greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought
 is all your strict preciseness come to this
york she and the dauphin have been juggling
 i did imagine what would be her refuge
warwick well go to we'll have no bastards live
 especially since charles must father it
joan la pucelle you are deceived my child is none of his
 it was alencon that enjoy'd my love
york alencon that notorious machiavel
 it dies an if it had a thousand lives
joan la pucelle o give me leave i have deluded you
 twas neither charles nor yet the duke i named
 but reignier king of naples that prevail'd
warwick a married man that's most intolerable
york why here's a girl i think she knows not well
 there were so many whom she may accuse
warwick it's sign she hath been liberal and free
york and yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
 strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee
 use no entreaty for it is in vain
joan la pucelle then lead me hence with whom i leave my curse
 may never glorious sun reflex his beams
 upon the country where you make abode
 but darkness and the gloomy shade of death
 environ you till mischief and despair
 drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves
 exit guarded
york break thou in pieces and consume to ashes
 thou foul accursed minister of hell
 enter cardinal of winchester attended
cardinal
of winchester lord regent i do greet your excellence
 with letters of commission from the king
 for know my lords the states of christendom
 moved with remorse of these outrageous broils
 have earnestly implored a general peace
 betwixt our nation and the aspiring french
 and here at hand the dauphin and his train
 approacheth to confer about some matter
york is all our travail turn'd to this effect
 after the slaughter of so many peers
 so many captains gentlemen and soldiers
 that in this quarrel have been overthrown
 and sold their bodies for their country's benefit
 shall we at last conclude effeminate peace
 have we not lost most part of all the towns
 by treason falsehood and by treachery
 our great progenitors had conquered
 o warwick warwick i foresee with grief
 the utter loss of all the realm of france
warwick be patient york if we conclude a peace
 it shall be with such strict and severe covenants
 as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby
 enter charles alencon bastard of orleans
 reignier and others
charles since lords of england it is thus agreed
 that peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in france
 we come to be informed by yourselves
 what the conditions of that league must be
york speak winchester for boiling choler chokes
 the hollow passage of my poison'd voice
 by sight of these our baleful enemies
cardinal
of winchester charles and the rest it is enacted thus
 that in regard king henry gives consent
 of mere compassion and of lenity
 to ease your country of distressful war
 and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
 you shall become true liegemen to his crown
 and charles upon condition thou wilt swear
 to pay him tribute submit thyself
 thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him
 and still enjoy thy regal dignity
alencon must he be then as shadow of himself
 adorn his temples with a coronet
 and yet in substance and authority
 retain but privilege of a private man
 this proffer is absurd and reasonless
charles tis known already that i am possess'd
 with more than half the gallian territories
 and therein reverenced for their lawful king
 shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd
 detract so much from that prerogative
 as to be call'd but viceroy of the whole
 no lord ambassador i'll rather keep
 that which i have than coveting for more
 be cast from possibility of all
york insulting charles hast thou by secret means
 used intercession to obtain a league
 and now the matter grows to compromise
 stand'st thou aloof upon comparison
 either accept the title thou usurp'st
 of benefit proceeding from our king
 and not of any challenge of desert
 or we will plague thee with incessant wars
reignier my lord you do not well in obstinacy
 to cavil in the course of this contract
 if once it be neglected ten to one
 we shall not find like opportunity
alencon to say the truth it is your policy
 to save your subjects from such massacre
 and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
 by our proceeding in hostility
 and therefore take this compact of a truce
 although you break it when your pleasure serves
warwick how say'st thou charles shall our condition stand
charles it shall
 only reserved you claim no interest
 in any of our towns of garrison
york then swear allegiance to his majesty
 as thou art knight never to disobey
 nor be rebellious to the crown of england
 thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england
 so now dismiss your army when ye please
 hang up your ensign let your drums be still
 for here we entertain a solemn peace

 1 king henry vi
act v
scene v london the palace
 enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi
 gloucester and exeter
king henry vi your wondrous rare description noble earl
 of beauteous margaret hath astonish'd me
 her virtues graced with external gifts
 do breed love's settled passions in my heart
 and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
 provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
 so am i driven by breath of her renown
 either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
 where i may have fruition of her love
suffolk tush my good lord this superficial tale
 is but a preface of her worthy praise
 the chief perfections of that lovely dame
 had i sufficient skill to utter them
 would make a volume of enticing lines
 able to ravish any dull conceit
 and which is more she is not so divine
 so fullreplete with choice of all delights
 but with as humble lowliness of mind
 she is content to be at your command
 command i mean of virtuous chaste intents
 to love and honour henry as her lord
king henry vi and otherwise will henry ne'er presume
 therefore my lord protector give consent
 that margaret may be england's royal queen
gloucester so should i give consent to flatter sin
 you know my lord your highness is betroth'd
 unto another lady of esteem
 how shall we then dispense with that contract
 and not deface your honour with reproach
suffolk as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
 or one that at a triumph having vow'd
 to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
 by reason of his adversary's odds
 a poor earl's daughter is unequal odds
 and therefore may be broke without offence
gloucester why what i pray is margaret more than that
 her father is no better than an earl
 although in glorious titles he excel
suffolk yes lord her father is a king
 the king of naples and jerusalem
 and of such great authority in france
 as his alliance will confirm our peace
 and keep the frenchmen in allegiance
gloucester and so the earl of armagnac may do
 because he is near kinsman unto charles
exeter beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
 where reignier sooner will receive than give
suffolk a dower my lords disgrace not so your king
 that he should be so abject base and poor
 to choose for wealth and not for perfect love
 henry is able to enrich his queen
 and not seek a queen to make him rich
 so worthless peasants bargain for their wives
 as marketmen for oxen sheep or horse
 marriage is a matter of more worth
 than to be dealt in by attorneyship
 not whom we will but whom his grace affects
 must be companion of his nuptial bed
 and therefore lords since he affects her most
 it most of all these reasons bindeth us
 in our opinions she should be preferr'd
 for what is wedlock forced but a hell
 an age of discord and continual strife
 whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
 and is a pattern of celestial peace
 whom should we match with henry being a king
 but margaret that is daughter to a king
 her peerless feature joined with her birth
 approves her fit for none but for a king
 her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
 more than in women commonly is seen
 will answer our hope in issue of a king
 for henry son unto a conqueror
 is likely to beget more conquerors
 if with a lady of so high resolve
 as is fair margaret he be link'd in love
 then yield my lords and here conclude with me
 that margaret shall be queen and none but she
king henry vi whether it be through force of your report
 my noble lord of suffolk or for that
 my tender youth was never yet attaint
 with any passion of inflaming love
 i cannot tell but this i am assured
 i feel such sharp dissension in my breast
 such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
 as i am sick with working of my thoughts
 take therefore shipping post my lord to france
 agree to any covenants and procure
 that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come
 to cross the seas to england and be crown'd
 king henry's faithful and anointed queen
 for your expenses and sufficient charge
 among the people gather up a tenth
 be gone i say for till you do return
 i rest perplexed with a thousand cares
 and you good uncle banish all offence
 if you do censure me by what you were
 not what you are i know it will excuse
 this sudden execution of my will
 and so conduct me where from company
 i may revolve and ruminate my grief
 exit
gloucester ay grief i fear me both at first and last
 exeunt gloucester and exeter
suffolk thus suffolk hath prevail'd and thus he goes
 as did the youthful paris once to greece
 with hope to find the like event in love
 but prosper better than the trojan did
 margaret shall now be queen and rule the king
 but i will rule both her the king and realm

 stuffing the ears of men with false reports

 should be the father of some stratagem
 the times are wild contention like a horse
 full of high feeding madly hath broke loose
 and bears down all before him
lord bardolph noble earl
 i bring you certain news from shrewsbury
northumberland good an god will
lord bardolph as good as heart can wish
 the king is almost wounded to the death
 and in the fortune of my lord your son
 prince harry slain outright and both the blunts
 kill'd by the hand of douglas young prince john
 and westmoreland and stafford fled the field
 and harry monmouth's brawn the hulk sir john
 is prisoner to your son o such a day
 so fought so follow'd and so fairly won
 came not till now to dignify the times
 since caesar's fortunes
northumberland how is this derived
 saw you the field came you from shrewsbury
lord bardolph i spake with one my lord that came from thence
 a gentleman well bred and of good name
 that freely render'd me these news for true
northumberland here comes my servant travers whom i sent
 on tuesday last to listen after news
 enter travers
lord bardolph my lord i overrode him on the way
 and he is furnish'd with no certainties
 more than he haply may retail from me
northumberland now travers what good tidings comes with you
travers my lord sir john umfrevile turn'd me back
 with joyful tidings and being better horsed
 outrode me after him came spurring hard
 a gentleman almost forspent with speed
 that stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse
 he ask'd the way to chester and of him
 i did demand what news from shrewsbury
 he told me that rebellion had bad luck
 and that young harry percy's spur was cold
 with that he gave his able horse the head
 and bending forward struck his armed heels
 against the panting sides of his poor jade
 up to the rowelhead and starting so
 he seem'd in running to devour the way
 staying no longer question
northumberland ha again
 said he young harry percy's spur was cold
 of hotspur coldspur that rebellion
 had met ill luck
lord bardolph my lord i'll tell you what
 if my young lord your son have not the day
 upon mine honour for a silken point
 i'll give my barony never talk of it
northumberland why should that gentleman that rode by travers
 give then such instances of loss
lord bardolph who he
 he was some hilding fellow that had stolen
 the horse he rode on and upon my life
 spoke at a venture look here comes more news
 enter morton
northumberland yea this man's brow like to a titleleaf
 foretells the nature of a tragic volume
 so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
 hath left a witness'd usurpation
 say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury
morton i ran from shrewsbury my noble lord
 where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
 to fright our party
northumberland how doth my son and brother
 thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
 is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
 even such a man so faint so spiritless
 so dull so dead in look so woebegone
 drew priam's curtain in the dead of night
 and would have told him half his troy was burnt
 but priam found the fire ere he his tongue
 and i my percy's death ere thou report'st it
 this thou wouldst say your son did thus and thus
 your brother thus so fought the noble douglas'
 stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
 but in the end to stop my ear indeed
 thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
 ending with brother son and all are dead'
morton douglas is living and your brother yet
 but for my lord your son
northumberland why he is dead
 see what a ready tongue suspicion hath
 he that but fears the thing he would not know
 hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes
 that what he fear'd is chanced yet speak morton
 tell thou an earl his divination lies
 and i will take it as a sweet disgrace
 and make thee rich for doing me such wrong
morton you are too great to be by me gainsaid
 your spirit is too true your fears too certain
northumberland yet for all this say not that percy's dead
 i see a strange confession in thine eye
 thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
 to speak a truth if he be slain say so
 the tongue offends not that reports his death
 and he doth sin that doth belie the dead
 not he which says the dead is not alive
 yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
 hath but a losing office and his tongue
 sounds ever after as a sullen bell
 remember'd tolling a departing friend
lord bardolph i cannot think my lord your son is dead
morton i am sorry i should force you to believe
 that which i would to god i had not seen
 but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
 rendering faint quittance wearied and outbreathed
 to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
 the neverdaunted percy to the earth
 from whence with life he never more sprung up
 in few his death whose spirit lent a fire
 even to the dullest peasant in his camp
 being bruited once took fire and heat away
 from the best temper'd courage in his troops
 for from his metal was his party steel'd
 which once in him abated all the rest
 turn'd on themselves like dull and heavy lead
 and as the thing that's heavy in itself
 upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
 so did our men heavy in hotspur's loss
 lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
 that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
 than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
 fly from the field then was the noble worcester
 too soon ta'en prisoner and that furious scot
 the bloody douglas whose welllabouring sword
 had three times slain the appearance of the king
 gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
 of those that turn'd their backs and in his flight
 stumbling in fear was took the sum of all
 is that the king hath won and hath sent out
 a speedy power to encounter you my lord
 under the conduct of young lancaster
 and westmoreland this is the news at full
northumberland for this i shall have time enough to mourn
 in poison there is physic and these news
 having been well that would have made me sick
 being sick have in some measure made me well
 and as the wretch whose feverweaken'd joints
 like strengthless hinges buckle under life
 impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
 out of his keeper's arms even so my limbs
 weaken'd with grief being now enraged with grief
 are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch
 a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
 must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif
 thou art a guard too wanton for the head
 which princes flesh'd with conquest aim to hit
 now bind my brows with iron and approach
 the ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
 to frown upon the enraged northumberland
 let heaven kiss earth now let not nature's hand
 keep the wild flood confined let order die
 and let this world no longer be a stage
 to feed contention in a lingering act
 but let one spirit of the firstborn cain
 reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
 on bloody courses the rude scene may end
 and darkness be the burier of the dead
travers this strained passion doth you wrong my lord
lord bardolph sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
morton the lives of all your loving complices
 lean on your health the which if you give o'er
 to stormy passion must perforce decay
 you cast the event of war my noble lord
 and summ'd the account of chance before you said
 let us make head it was your presurmise
 that in the dole of blows your son might drop
 you knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge
 more likely to fall in than to get o'er
 you were advised his flesh was capable
 of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
 would lift him where most trade of danger ranged
 yet did you say go forth and none of this
 though strongly apprehended could restrain
 the stiffborne action what hath then befallen
 or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
 more than that being which was like to be
lord bardolph we all that are engaged to this loss
 knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
 that if we wrought our life twas ten to one
 and yet we ventured for the gain proposed
 choked the respect of likely peril fear'd
 and since we are o'erset venture again
 come we will all put forth body and goods
morton tis more than time and my most noble lord
 i hear for certain and do speak the truth
 the gentle archbishop of york is up
 with wellappointed powers he is a man
 who with a double surety binds his followers
 my lord your son had only but the corpse
 but shadows and the shows of men to fight
 for that same word rebellion did divide
 the action of their bodies from their souls
 and they did fight with queasiness constrain'd
 as men drink potions that their weapons only
 seem'd on our side but for their spirits and souls
 this word rebellion it had froze them up
 as fish are in a pond but now the bishop
 turns insurrection to religion
 supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts
 he's followed both with body and with mind
 and doth enlarge his rising with the blood
 of fair king richard scraped from pomfret stones
 derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
 tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
 gasping for life under great bolingbroke
 and more and less do flock to follow him
northumberland i knew of this before but to speak truth
 this present grief had wiped it from my mind
 go in with me and counsel every man
 the aptest way for safety and revenge
 get posts and letters and make friends with speed
 never so few and never yet more need

scene ii london a street
 enter falstaff with his page bearing his sword
 and buckler
falstaff sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water
page he said sir the water itself was a good healthy
 water but for the party that owed it he might
 have more diseases than he knew for
falstaff men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the
 brain of this foolishcompounded clay man is not
 able to invent anything that tends to laughter more
 than i invent or is invented on me i am not only
 witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other
 men i do here walk before thee like a sow that
 hath overwhelmed all her litter but one if the
 prince put thee into my service for any other reason
 than to set me off why then i have no judgment
 thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn
 in my cap than to wait at my heels i was never
 manned with an agate till now but i will inset you
 neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and
 send you back again to your master for a jewel
 the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is
 not yet fledged i will sooner have a beard grow in
 the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
 cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is
 a faceroyal god may finish it when he will tis
 not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still at a
 faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence
 out of it and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
 writ man ever since his father was a bachelor he
 may keep his own grace but he's almost out of mine
 i can assure him what said master dombledon about
 the satin for my short cloak and my slops
page he said sir you should procure him better
 assurance than bardolph he would not take his
 band and yours he liked not the security
falstaff let him be damned like the glutton pray god his
 tongue be hotter a whoreson achitophel a rascally
 yeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand
 and then stand upon security the whoreson
 smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and
 bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is
 through with them in honest taking up then they
 must stand upon security i had as lief they would
 put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
 security i looked a should have sent me two and
 twenty yards of satin as i am a true knight and he
 sends me security well he may sleep in security
 for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness
 of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he
 see though he have his own lanthorn to light him
 where's bardolph
page he's gone into smithfield to buy your worship a horse
falstaff i bought him in paul's and he'll buy me a horse in
 smithfield an i could get me but a wife in the
 stews i were manned horsed and wived
 enter the lord chiefjustice and servant
page sir here comes the nobleman that committed the
 prince for striking him about bardolph
falstaff wait close i will not see him
lord chiefjustice what's he that goes there
servant falstaff an't please your lordship
lord chiefjustice he that was in question for the robbery
servant he my lord but he hath since done good service at
 shrewsbury and as i hear is now going with some
 charge to the lord john of lancaster
lord chiefjustice what to york call him back again
servant sir john falstaff
falstaff boy tell him i am deaf
page you must speak louder my master is deaf
lord chiefjustice i am sure he is to the hearing of any thing good
 go pluck him by the elbow i must speak with him
servant sir john
falstaff what a young knave and begging is there not
 wars is there not employment doth not the king
 lack subjects do not the rebels need soldiers
 though it be a shame to be on any side but one it
 is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side
 were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
 how to make it
servant you mistake me sir
falstaff why sir did i say you were an honest man setting
 my knighthood and my soldiership aside i had lied
 in my throat if i had said so
servant i pray you sir then set your knighthood and our
 soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you
 you lie in your throat if you say i am any other
 than an honest man
falstaff i give thee leave to tell me so i lay aside that
 which grows to me if thou gettest any leave of me
 hang me if thou takest leave thou wert better be
 hanged you hunt counter hence avaunt
servant sir my lord would speak with you
lord chiefjustice sir john falstaff a word with you
falstaff my good lord god give your lordship good time of
 day i am glad to see your lordship abroad i heard
 say your lordship was sick i hope your lordship
 goes abroad by advice your lordship though not
 clean past your youth hath yet some smack of age in
 you some relish of the saltness of time and i must
 humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
 of your health
lord chiefjustice sir john i sent for you before your expedition to
 shrewsbury
falstaff an't please your lordship i hear his majesty is
 returned with some discomfort from wales
lord chiefjustice i talk not of his majesty you would not come when
 i sent for you
falstaff and i hear moreover his highness is fallen into
 this same whoreson apoplexy
lord chiefjustice well god mend him i pray you let me speak with
 you
falstaff this apoplexy is as i take it a kind of lethargy
 an't please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the
 blood a whoreson tingling
lord chiefjustice what tell you me of it be it as it is
falstaff it hath its original from much grief from study and
 perturbation of the brain i have read the cause of
 his effects in galen it is a kind of deafness
lord chiefjustice i think you are fallen into the disease for you
 hear not what i say to you
falstaff very well my lord very well rather an't please
 you it is the disease of not listening the malady
 of not marking that i am troubled withal
lord chiefjustice to punish you by the heels would amend the
 attention of your ears and i care not if i do
 become your physician
falstaff i am as poor as job my lord but not so patient
 your lordship may minister the potion of
 imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how
 should i be your patient to follow your
 prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a
 scruple or indeed a scruple itself
lord chiefjustice i sent for you when there were matters against you
 for your life to come speak with me
falstaff as i was then advised by my learned counsel in the
 laws of this landservice i did not come
lord chiefjustice well the truth is sir john you live in great infamy
falstaff he that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less
lord chiefjustice your means are very slender and your waste is great
falstaff i would it were otherwise i would my means were
 greater and my waist slenderer
lord chiefjustice you have misled the youthful prince
falstaff the young prince hath misled me i am the fellow
 with the great belly and he my dog
lord chiefjustice well i am loath to gall a newhealed wound your
 day's service at shrewsbury hath a little gilded
 over your night's exploit on gad'shill you may
 thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'erposting
 that action
falstaff my lord
lord chiefjustice but since all is well keep it so wake not a
 sleeping wolf
falstaff to wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox
lord chiefjustice what you are as a candle the better part burnt
 out
falstaff a wassail candle my lord all tallow if i did say
 of wax my growth would approve the truth
lord chiefjustice there is not a white hair on your face but should
 have his effect of gravity
falstaff his effect of gravy gravy gravy
lord chiefjustice you follow the young prince up and down like his
 ill angel
falstaff not so my lord your ill angel is light but i hope
 he that looks upon me will take me without weighing
 and yet in some respects i grant i cannot go i
 cannot tell virtue is of so little regard in these
 costermonger times that true valour is turned
 bearherd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath
 his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the
 other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of
 this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry
 you that are old consider not the capacities of us
 that are young you do measure the heat of our
 livers with the bitterness of your galls and we
 that are in the vaward of our youth i must confess
 are wags too
lord chiefjustice do you set down your name in the scroll of youth
 that are written down old with all the characters of
 age have you not a moist eye a dry hand a
 yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an
 increasing belly is not your voice broken your
 wind short your chin double your wit single and
 every part about you blasted with antiquity and
 will you yet call yourself young fie fie fie sir john
falstaff my lord i was born about three of the clock in the
 afternoon with a white head and something a round
 belly for my voice i have lost it with halloing
 and singing of anthems to approve my youth
 further i will not the truth is i am only old in
 judgment and understanding and he that will caper
 with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the
 money and have at him for the box of the ear that
 the prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince
 and you took it like a sensible lord i have
 chequed him for it and the young lion repents
 marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk
 and old sack
lord chiefjustice well god send the prince a better companion
falstaff god send the companion a better prince i cannot
 rid my hands of him
lord chiefjustice well the king hath severed you and prince harry i
 hear you are going with lord john of lancaster
 against the archbishop and the earl of
 northumberland
falstaff yea i thank your pretty sweet wit for it but look
 you pray all you that kiss my lady peace at home
 that our armies join not in a hot day for by the
 lord i take but two shirts out with me and i mean
 not to sweat extraordinarily if it be a hot day
 and i brandish any thing but a bottle i would i
 might never spit white again there is not a
 dangerous action can peep out his head but i am
 thrust upon it well i cannot last ever but it
 was alway yet the trick of our english nation if
 they have a good thing to make it too common if
 ye will needs say i am an old man you should give
 me rest i would to god my name were not so
 terrible to the enemy as it is i were better to be
 eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
 nothing with perpetual motion
lord chiefjustice well be honest be honest and god bless your
 expedition
falstaff will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
 furnish me forth
lord chiefjustice not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to
 bear crosses fare you well commend me to my
 cousin westmoreland
 exeunt chiefjustice and servant
falstaff if i do fillip me with a threeman beetle a man
 can no more separate age and covetousness than a'
 can part young limbs and lechery but the gout
 galls the one and the pox pinches the other and
 so both the degrees prevent my curses boy
page sir
falstaff what money is in my purse
page seven groats and two pence
falstaff i can get no remedy against this consumption of the
 purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out
 but the disease is incurable go bear this letter
 to my lord of lancaster this to the prince this
 to the earl of westmoreland and this to old
 mistress ursula whom i have weekly sworn to marry
 since i perceived the first white hair on my chin
 about it you know where to find me
 exit page
 a pox of this gout or a gout of this pox for
 the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
 toe tis no matter if i do halt i have the wars

 reasonable a good wit will make use of any thing
 i will turn diseases to commodity

scene iii york the archbishop's palace
 enter the archbishop of york the lords hastings
 mowbray and bardolph
archbishop of york thus have you heard our cause and known our means
 and my most noble friends i pray you all
 speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
 and first lord marshal what say you to it
mowbray i well allow the occasion of our arms
 but gladly would be better satisfied
 how in our means we should advance ourselves
 to look with forehead bold and big enough
 upon the power and puissance of the king
hastings our present musters grow upon the file
 to five and twenty thousand men of choice
 and our supplies live largely in the hope
 of great northumberland whose bosom burns
 with an incensed fire of injuries
lord bardolph the question then lord hastings standeth thus
 whether our present five and twenty thousand
 may hold up head without northumberland
hastings with him we may
lord bardolph yea marry there's the point
 but if without him we be thought too feeble
 my judgment is we should not step too far
 till we had his assistance by the hand
 for in a theme so bloodyfaced as this
 conjecture expectation and surmise
 of aids incertain should not be admitted
archbishop of york tis very true lord bardolph for indeed
 it was young hotspur's case at shrewsbury
lord bardolph it was my lord who lined himself with hope
 eating the air on promise of supply
 flattering himself in project of a power
 much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
 and so with great imagination
 proper to madmen led his powers to death
 and winking leap'd into destruction
hastings but by your leave it never yet did hurt
 to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
lord bardolph yes if this present quality of war
 indeed the instant action a cause on foot
 lives so in hope as in an early spring
 we see the appearing buds which to prove fruit
 hope gives not so much warrant as despair
 that frosts will bite them when we mean to build
 we first survey the plot then draw the model
 and when we see the figure of the house
 then must we rate the cost of the erection
 which if we find outweighs ability
 what do we then but draw anew the model
 in fewer offices or at last desist
 to build at all much more in this great work
 which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
 and set another up should we survey
 the plot of situation and the model
 consent upon a sure foundation
 question surveyors know our own estate
 how able such a work to undergo
 to weigh against his opposite or else
 we fortify in paper and in figures
 using the names of men instead of men
 like one that draws the model of a house
 beyond his power to build it who half through
 gives o'er and leaves his partcreated cost
 a naked subject to the weeping clouds
 and waste for churlish winter's tyranny
hastings grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
 should be stillborn and that we now possess'd
 the utmost man of expectation
 i think we are a body strong enough
 even as we are to equal with the king
lord bardolph what is the king but five and twenty thousand
hastings to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph
 for his divisions as the times do brawl
 are in three heads one power against the french
 and one against glendower perforce a third
 must take up us so is the unfirm king
 in three divided and his coffers sound
 with hollow poverty and emptiness
archbishop of york that he should draw his several strengths together
 and come against us in full puissance
 need not be dreaded
hastings if he should do so
 he leaves his back unarm'd the french and welsh
 baying him at the heels never fear that
lord bardolph who is it like should lead his forces hither
hastings the duke of lancaster and westmoreland
 against the welsh himself and harry monmouth
 but who is substituted gainst the french
 i have no certain notice
archbishop of york let us on
 and publish the occasion of our arms
 the commonwealth is sick of their own choice
 their overgreedy love hath surfeited
 an habitation giddy and unsure
 hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
 o thou fond many with what loud applause
 didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke
 before he was what thou wouldst have him be
 and being now trimm'd in thine own desires
 thou beastly feeder art so full of him
 that thou provokest thyself to cast him up
 so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
 thy glutton bosom of the royal richard
 and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
 and howl'st to find it what trust is in
 these times
 they that when richard lived would have him die
 are now become enamour'd on his grave
 thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
 when through proud london he came sighing on
 after the admired heels of bolingbroke
 criest now o earth yield us that king again
 and take thou this o thoughts of men accursed
 past and to come seems best things present worst
mowbray shall we go draw our numbers and set on
hastings we are time's subjects and time bids be gone

scene ii london another street
 enter prince henry and poins
prince henry before god i am exceeding weary
poins is't come to that i had thought weariness durst not
 have attached one of so high blood
prince henry faith it does me though it discolours the
 complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it doth
 it not show vilely in me to desire small beer
poins why a prince should not be so loosely studied as
 to remember so weak a composition
prince henry belike then my appetite was not princely got for
 by my troth i do now remember the poor creature
 small beer but indeed these humble
 considerations make me out of love with my
 greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember
 thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to
 take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
 hast viz these and those that were thy
 peachcoloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy
 shirts as one for superfluity and another for
 use but that the tenniscourtkeeper knows better
 than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
 thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done
 a great while because the rest of thy low
 countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland
 and god knows whether those that bawl out the ruins
 of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the
 midwives say the children are not in the fault
 whereupon the world increases and kindreds are
 mightily strengthened
poins how ill it follows after you have laboured so hard
 you should talk so idly tell me how many good
 young princes would do so their fathers being so
 sick as yours at this time is
prince henry shall i tell thee one thing poins
poins yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing
prince henry it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine
poins go to i stand the push of your one thing that you
 will tell

 sad now my father is sick albeit i could tell
 thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a
 better to call my friend i could be sad and sad
 indeed too
poins very hardly upon such a subject
prince henry by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
 book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and
 persistency let the end try the man but i tell
 thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
 sick and keeping such vile company as thou art
 hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow
poins the reason
prince henry what wouldst thou think of me if i should weep
poins i would think thee a most princely hypocrite
prince henry it would be every man's thought and thou art a
 blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never
 a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway
 better than thine every man would think me an
 hypocrite indeed and what accites your most
 worshipful thought to think so
poins why because you have been so lewd and so much
 engraffed to falstaff
prince henry and to thee
poins by this light i am well spoke on i can hear it

act ii
scene iii warkworth before the castle
 enter northumberland lady northumberland and lady percy
northumberland i pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter
 give even way unto my rough affairs
 put not you on the visage of the times
 and be like them to percy troublesome
lady
northumberland i have given over i will speak no more
 do what you will your wisdom be your guide
northumberland alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
 and but my going nothing can redeem it
lady percy o yet for god's sake go not to these wars
 the time was father that you broke your word
 when you were more endeared to it than now
 when your own percy when my heart's dear harry
 threw many a northward look to see his father
 bring up his powers but he did long in vain
 who then persuaded you to stay at home
 there were two honours lost yours and your son's
 for yours the god of heaven brighten it
 for his it stuck upon him as the sun
 in the grey vault of heaven and by his light
 did all the chivalry of england move
 to do brave acts he was indeed the glass
 wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
 he had no legs that practised not his gait
 and speaking thick which nature made his blemish
 became the accents of the valiant
 for those that could speak low and tardily
 would turn their own perfection to abuse
 to seem like him so that in speech in gait
 in diet in affections of delight
 in military rules humours of blood
 he was the mark and glass copy and book
 that fashion'd others and him o wondrous him
 o miracle of men him did you leave
 second to none unseconded by you
 to look upon the hideous god of war
 in disadvantage to abide a field
 where nothing but the sound of hotspur's name
 did seem defensible so you left him
 never o never do his ghost the wrong
 to hold your honour more precise and nice
 with others than with him let them alone
 the marshal and the archbishop are strong
 had my sweet harry had but half their numbers
 today might i hanging on hotspur's neck
 have talk'd of monmouth's grave
northumberland beshrew your heart
 fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
 with new lamenting ancient oversights
 but i must go and meet with danger there
 or it will seek me in another place
 and find me worse provided
lady
northumberland o fly to scotland
 till that the nobles and the armed commons
 have of their puissance made a little taste
lady percy if they get ground and vantage of the king
 then join you with them like a rib of steel
 to make strength stronger but for all our loves
 first let them try themselves so did your son
 he was so suffer'd so came i a widow
 and never shall have length of life enough
 to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
 that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
 for recordation to my noble husband
northumberland come come go in with me tis with my mind
 as with the tide swell'd up unto his height
 that makes a stillstand running neither way
 fain would i go to meet the archbishop
 but many thousand reasons hold me back
 i will resolve for scotland there am i
 till time and vantage crave my company

 under the canopies of costly state
 and lull'd with sound of sweetest melody
 o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
 in loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch
 a watchcase or a common larumbell
 wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
 seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains
 in cradle of the rude imperious surge
 and in the visitation of the winds
 who take the ruffian billows by the top
 curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
 with deafening clamour in the slippery clouds
 that with the hurly death itself awakes
 canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose
 to the wet seaboy in an hour so rude
 and in the calmest and most stillest night
 with all appliances and means to boot
 deny it to a king then happy low lie down
 uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
 enter warwick and surrey
warwick many good morrows to your majesty
king henry iv is it good morrow lords
warwick tis one o'clock and past
king henry iv why then good morrow to you all my lords
 have you read o'er the letters that i sent you
warwick we have my liege
king henry iv then you perceive the body of our kingdom
 how foul it is what rank diseases grow
 and with what danger near the heart of it
warwick it is but as a body yet distemper'd
 which to his former strength may be restored
 with good advice and little medicine
 my lord northumberland will soon be cool'd
king henry iv o god that one might read the book of fate
 and see the revolution of the times
 make mountains level and the continent
 weary of solid firmness melt itself
 into the sea and other times to see
 the beachy girdle of the ocean
 too wide for neptune's hips how chances mock
 and changes fill the cup of alteration
 with divers liquors o if this were seen
 the happiest youth viewing his progress through
 what perils past what crosses to ensue
 would shut the book and sit him down and die
 tis not ten years gone
 since richard and northumberland great friends
 did feast together and in two years after
 were they at wars it is but eight years since
 this percy was the man nearest my soul
 who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
 and laid his love and life under my foot
 yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard
 gave him defiance but which of you was by
 you cousin nevil as i may remember
 to warwick
 when richard with his eye brimful of tears
 then cheque'd and rated by northumberland
 did speak these words now proved a prophecy
 northumberland thou ladder by the which
 my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne'
 though then god knows i had no such intent
 but that necessity so bow'd the state
 that i and greatness were compell'd to kiss
 the time shall come thus did he follow it
 the time will come that foul sin gathering head
 shall break into corruption so went on
 foretelling this same time's condition
 and the division of our amity
warwick there is a history in all men's lives
 figuring the nature of the times deceased
 the which observed a man may prophesy
 with a near aim of the main chance of things
 as yet not come to life which in their seeds
 and weak beginnings lie intreasured
 such things become the hatch and brood of time
 and by the necessary form of this
 king richard might create a perfect guess
 that great northumberland then false to him
 would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
 which should not find a ground to root upon
 unless on you
king henry iv are these things then necessities
 then let us meet them like necessities
 and that same word even now cries out on us
 they say the bishop and northumberland
 are fifty thousand strong
warwick it cannot be my lord
 rumour doth double like the voice and echo
 the numbers of the fear'd please it your grace
 to go to bed upon my soul my lord
 the powers that you already have sent forth
 shall bring this prize in very easily
 to comfort you the more i have received
 a certain instance that glendower is dead
 your majesty hath been this fortnight ill
 and these unseason'd hours perforce must add
 unto your sickness
king henry iv i will take your counsel
 and were these inward wars once out of hand
 we would dear lords unto the holy land

 see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how
 subject we old men are to this vice of lying this
 same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
 me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he
 hath done about turnbull street and every third
 word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk's
 tribute i do remember him at clement's inn like a
 man made after supper of a cheeseparing when a'
 was naked he was for all the world like a forked
 radish with a head fantastically carved upon it
 with a knife a was so forlorn that his
 dimensions to any thick sight were invincible a'
 was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a
 monkey and the whores called him mandrake a came
 ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those
 tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
 carmen whistle and swear they were his fancies or
 his goodnights and now is this vice's dagger
 become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a
 gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and
 i'll be sworn a ne'er saw him but once in the
 tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding
 among the marshal's men i saw it and told john a
 gaunt he beat his own name for you might have
 thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the
 case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a
 court and now has he land and beefs well i'll
 be acquainted with him if i return and it shall
 go hard but i will make him a philosopher's two
 stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the
 old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i
 may snap at him let time shape and there an end

scene i yorkshire gaultree forest
 enter the archbishop of york mowbray lord
 hastings and others
archbishop of york what is this forest call'd
hastings tis gaultree forest an't shall please your grace
archbishop of york here stand my lords and send discoverers forth
 to know the numbers of our enemies
hastings we have sent forth already
archbishop of york tis well done
 my friends and brethren in these great affairs
 i must acquaint you that i have received
 newdated letters from northumberland
 their cold intent tenor and substance thus
 here doth he wish his person with such powers
 as might hold sortance with his quality
 the which he could not levy whereupon
 he is retired to ripe his growing fortunes
 to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
 that your attempts may overlive the hazard
 and fearful melting of their opposite
mowbray thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
 and dash themselves to pieces
 enter a messenger
hastings now what news
messenger west of this forest scarcely off a mile
 in goodly form comes on the enemy
 and by the ground they hide i judge their number
 upon or near the rate of thirty thousand
mowbray the just proportion that we gave them out
 let us sway on and face them in the field
archbishop of york what wellappointed leader fronts us here
 enter westmoreland
mowbray i think it is my lord of westmoreland
westmoreland health and fair greeting from our general
 the prince lord john and duke of lancaster
archbishop of york say on my lord of westmoreland in peace
 what doth concern your coming
westmoreland then my lord
 unto your grace do i in chief address
 the substance of my speech if that rebellion
 came like itself in base and abject routs
 led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
 and countenanced by boys and beggary
 i say if damn'd commotion so appear'd
 in his true native and most proper shape
 you reverend father and these noble lords
 had not been here to dress the ugly form
 of base and bloody insurrection
 with your fair honours you lord archbishop
 whose see is by a civil peace maintained
 whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd
 whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd
 whose white investments figure innocence
 the dove and very blessed spirit of peace
 wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
 out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
 into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war
 turning your books to graves your ink to blood
 your pens to lances and your tongue divine
 to a trumpet and a point of war
archbishop of york wherefore do i this so the question stands
 briefly to this end we are all diseased
 and with our surfeiting and wanton hours
 have brought ourselves into a burning fever
 and we must bleed for it of which disease
 our late king richard being infected died
 but my most noble lord of westmoreland
 i take not on me here as a physician
 nor do i as an enemy to peace
 troop in the throngs of military men
 but rather show awhile like fearful war
 to diet rank minds sick of happiness
 and purge the obstructions which begin to stop
 our very veins of life hear me more plainly
 i have in equal balance justly weigh'd
 what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
 and find our griefs heavier than our offences
 we see which way the stream of time doth run
 and are enforced from our most quiet there
 by the rough torrent of occasion
 and have the summary of all our griefs
 when time shall serve to show in articles
 which long ere this we offer'd to the king
 and might by no suit gain our audience
 when we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs
 we are denied access unto his person
 even by those men that most have done us wrong
 the dangers of the days but newly gone
 whose memory is written on the earth
 with yet appearing blood and the examples
 of every minute's instance present now
 hath put us in these illbeseeming arms
 not to break peace or any branch of it
 but to establish here a peace indeed
 concurring both in name and quality
westmoreland when ever yet was your appeal denied
 wherein have you been galled by the king
 what peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you
 that you should seal this lawless bloody book
 of forged rebellion with a seal divine
 and consecrate commotion's bitter edge
archbishop of york my brother general the commonwealth
 to brother born an household cruelty
 i make my quarrel in particular
westmoreland there is no need of any such redress
 or if there were it not belongs to you
mowbray why not to him in part and to us all
 that feel the bruises of the days before
 and suffer the condition of these times
 to lay a heavy and unequal hand
 upon our honours
westmoreland o my good lord mowbray
 construe the times to their necessities
 and you shall say indeed it is the time
 and not the king that doth you injuries
 yet for your part it not appears to me
 either from the king or in the present time
 that you should have an inch of any ground
 to build a grief on were you not restored
 to all the duke of norfolk's signories
 your noble and right well remember'd father's
mowbray what thing in honour had my father lost
 that need to be revived and breathed in me
 the king that loved him as the state stood then
 was force perforce compell'd to banish him
 and then that harry bolingbroke and he
 being mounted and both roused in their seats
 their neighing coursers daring of the spur
 their armed staves in charge their beavers down
 their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
 and the loud trumpet blowing them together
 then then when there was nothing could have stay'd
 my father from the breast of bolingbroke
 o when the king did throw his warder down
 his own life hung upon the staff he threw
 then threw he down himself and all their lives
 that by indictment and by dint of sword
 have since miscarried under bolingbroke
westmoreland you speak lord mowbray now you know not what
 the earl of hereford was reputed then
 in england the most valiant gentlemen
 who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled
 but if your father had been victor there
 he ne'er had borne it out of coventry
 for all the country in a general voice
 cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
 were set on hereford whom they doted on
 and bless'd and graced indeed more than the king
 but this is mere digression from my purpose
 here come i from our princely general
 to know your griefs to tell you from his grace
 that he will give you audience and wherein
 it shall appear that your demands are just
 you shall enjoy them every thing set off
 that might so much as think you enemies
mowbray but he hath forced us to compel this offer
 and it proceeds from policy not love
westmoreland mowbray you overween to take it so
 this offer comes from mercy not from fear
 for lo within a ken our army lies
 upon mine honour all too confident
 to give admittance to a thought of fear
 our battle is more full of names than yours
 our men more perfect in the use of arms
 our armour all as strong our cause the best
 then reason will our heart should be as good
 say you not then our offer is compell'd
mowbray well by my will we shall admit no parley
westmoreland that argues but the shame of your offence
 a rotten case abides no handling
hastings hath the prince john a full commission
 in very ample virtue of his father
 to hear and absolutely to determine
 of what conditions we shall stand upon
westmoreland that is intended in the general's name
 i muse you make so slight a question
archbishop of york then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule
 for this contains our general grievances
 each several article herein redress'd
 all members of our cause both here and hence
 that are insinew'd to this action
 acquitted by a true substantial form
 and present execution of our wills
 to us and to our purposes confined
 we come within our awful banks again
 and knit our powers to the arm of peace
westmoreland this will i show the general please you lords
 in sight of both our battles we may meet
 and either end in peace which god so frame
 or to the place of difference call the swords
 which must decide it
archbishop of york my lord we will do so
 exit westmoreland
mowbray there is a thing within my bosom tells me
 that no conditions of our peace can stand
hastings fear you not that if we can make our peace
 upon such large terms and so absolute
 as our conditions shall consist upon
 our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
mowbray yea but our valuation shall be such
 that every slight and falsederived cause
 yea every idle nice and wanton reason
 shall to the king taste of this action
 that were our royal faiths martyrs in love
 we shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
 that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
 and good from bad find no partition
archbishop of york no no my lord note this the king is weary
 of dainty and such picking grievances
 for he hath found to end one doubt by death
 revives two greater in the heirs of life
 and therefore will he wipe his tables clean
 and keep no telltale to his memory
 that may repeat and history his loss
 to new remembrance for full well he knows
 he cannot so precisely weed this land
 as his misdoubts present occasion
 his foes are so enrooted with his friends
 that plucking to unfix an enemy
 he doth unfasten so and shake a friend
 so that this land like an offensive wife
 that hath enraged him on to offer strokes
 as he is striking holds his infant up
 and hangs resolved correction in the arm
 that was uprear'd to execution
hastings besides the king hath wasted all his rods
 on late offenders that he now doth lack
 the very instruments of chastisement
 so that his power like to a fangless lion
 may offer but not hold
archbishop of york tis very true
 and therefore be assured my good lord marshal
 if we do now make our atonement well
 our peace will like a broken limb united
 grow stronger for the breaking
mowbray be it so
 here is return'd my lord of westmoreland
 reenter westmoreland
westmoreland the prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship
 to meet his grace just distance tween our armies
mowbray your grace of york in god's name then set forward
archbishop of york before and greet his grace my lord we come

scene ii another part of the forest
 enter from one side mowbray attended afterwards
 the archbishop of york hastings and others from
 the other side prince john of lancaster and
 westmoreland officers and others with them
lancaster you are well encounter'd here my cousin mowbray
 good day to you gentle lord archbishop
 and so to you lord hastings and to all
 my lord of york it better show'd with you
 when that your flock assembled by the bell
 encircled you to hear with reverence
 your exposition on the holy text
 than now to see you here an iron man
 cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
 turning the word to sword and life to death
 that man that sits within a monarch's heart
 and ripens in the sunshine of his favour
 would he abuse the countenance of the king
 alack what mischiefs might he set abrooch
 in shadow of such greatness with you lord bishop
 it is even so who hath not heard it spoken
 how deep you were within the books of god
 to us the speaker in his parliament
 to us the imagined voice of god himself
 the very opener and intelligencer
 between the grace the sanctities of heaven
 and our dull workings o who shall believe
 but you misuse the reverence of your place
 employ the countenance and grace of heaven
 as a false favourite doth his prince's name
 in deeds dishonourable you have ta'en up
 under the counterfeited zeal of god
 the subjects of his substitute my father
 and both against the peace of heaven and him
 have here upswarm'd them
archbishop of york good my lord of lancaster
 i am not here against your father's peace
 but as i told my lord of westmoreland
 the time misorder'd doth in common sense
 crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
 to hold our safety up i sent your grace
 the parcels and particulars of our grief
 the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court
 whereon this hydra son of war is born
 whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
 with grant of our most just and right desires
 and true obedience of this madness cured
 stoop tamely to the foot of majesty
mowbray if not we ready are to try our fortunes
 to the last man
hastings and though we here fall down
 we have supplies to second our attempt
 if they miscarry theirs shall second them
 and so success of mischief shall be born
 and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
 whiles england shall have generation
lancaster you are too shallow hastings much too shallow
 to sound the bottom of the aftertimes
westmoreland pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
 how far forth you do like their articles
lancaster i like them all and do allow them well
 and swear here by the honour of my blood
 my father's purposes have been mistook
 and some about him have too lavishly
 wrested his meaning and authority
 my lord these griefs shall be with speed redress'd
 upon my soul they shall if this may please you
 discharge your powers unto their several counties
 as we will ours and here between the armies
 let's drink together friendly and embrace
 that all their eyes may bear those tokens home
 of our restored love and amity
archbishop of york i take your princely word for these redresses
lancaster i give it you and will maintain my word
 and thereupon i drink unto your grace
hastings go captain and deliver to the army
 this news of peace let them have pay and part

 of valour do you think me a swallow an arrow or a
 bullet have i in my poor and old motion the
 expedition of thought i have speeded hither with
 the very extremest inch of possibility i have
 foundered nine score and odd posts and here
 traveltainted as i am have in my pure and
 immaculate valour taken sir john colevile of the
 dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy
 but what of that he saw me and yielded that i
 may justly say with the hooknosed fellow of rome
 i came saw and overcame'
lancaster it was more of his courtesy than your deserving
falstaff i know not here he is and here i yield him and
 i beseech your grace let it be booked with the
 rest of this day's deeds or by the lord i will
 have it in a particular ballad else with mine own
 picture on the top on't colevile kissing my foot
 to the which course if i be enforced if you do not
 all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the
 clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full
 moon doth the cinders of the element which show
 like pins heads to her believe not the word of
 the noble therefore let me have right and let
 desert mount
lancaster thine's too heavy to mount

 good and call it what you will
lancaster is thy name colevile
colevile it is my lord
lancaster a famous rebel art thou colevile
falstaff and a famous true subject took him
colevile i am my lord but as my betters are

falstaff i know not how they sold themselves but thou like
 a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i
 thank thee for thee
 reenter westmoreland
lancaster now have you left pursuit
westmoreland retreat is made and execution stay'd
lancaster send colevile with his confederates
 to york to present execution
 blunt lead him hence and see you guard him sure
 exeunt blunt and others with colevile
 and now dispatch we toward the court my lords
 i hear the king my father is sore sick
 our news shall go before us to his majesty
 which cousin you shall bear to comfort him
 and we with sober speed will follow you
falstaff my lord i beseech you give me leave to go
 through gloucestershire and when you come to court
 stand my good lord pray in your good report
lancaster fare you well falstaff i in my condition
 shall better speak of you than you deserve
 exeunt all but falstaff
falstaff i would you had but the wit twere better than
 your dukedom good faith this same young sober
 blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make
 him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine
 there's never none of these demure boys come to any
 proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood
 and making many fishmeals that they fall into a
 kind of male greensickness and then when they
 marry they get wenches they are generally fools
 and cowards which some of us should be too but for
 inflammation a good sherris sack hath a twofold
 operation in it it ascends me into the brain
 dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
 vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive
 quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and
 delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the
 voice the tongue which is the birth becomes
 excellent wit the second property of your
 excellent sherris is the warming of the blood
 which before cold and settled left the liver
 white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity
 and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes
 it course from the inwards to the parts extreme
 it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives
 warning to all the rest of this little kingdom
 man to arm and then the vital commoners and
 inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain
 the heart who great and puffed up with this
 retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour
 comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is
 nothing without sack for that sets it awork and
 learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till
 sack commences it and sets it in act and use
 hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for
 the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
 father he hath like lean sterile and bare land
 manured husbanded and tilled with excellent
 endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
 sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if
 i had a thousand sons the first humane principle i
 would teach them should be to forswear thin
 potations and to addict themselves to sack
 enter bardolph
 how now bardolph

 enter king henry iv the princes thomas of clarence
 and humphrey of gloucester warwick and others
king henry iv now lords if god doth give successful end
 to this debate that bleedeth at our doors
 we will our youth lead on to higher fields
 and draw no swords but what are sanctified
 our navy is address'd our power collected
 our substitutes in absence well invested
 and every thing lies level to our wish
 only we want a little personal strength
 and pause us till these rebels now afoot
 come underneath the yoke of government
warwick both which we doubt not but your majesty
 shall soon enjoy
king henry iv humphrey my son of gloucester
 where is the prince your brother
gloucester i think he's gone to hunt my lord at windsor
king henry iv and how accompanied
gloucester i do not know my lord
king henry iv is not his brother thomas of clarence with him
gloucester no my good lord he is in presence here
clarence what would my lord and father
king henry iv nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence
 how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother
 he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas
 thou hast a better place in his affection
 than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
 and noble offices thou mayst effect
 of mediation after i am dead
 between his greatness and thy other brethren
 therefore omit him not blunt not his love
 nor lose the good advantage of his grace
 by seeming cold or careless of his will
 for he is gracious if he be observed
 he hath a tear for pity and a hand
 open as day for melting charity
 yet notwithstanding being incensed he's flint
 as humorous as winter and as sudden
 as flaws congealed in the spring of day
 his temper therefore must be well observed
 chide him for faults and do it reverently
 when thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth
 but being moody give him line and scope
 till that his passions like a whale on ground
 confound themselves with working learn this thomas
 and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
 a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
 that the united vessel of their blood
 mingled with venom of suggestion
 as force perforce the age will pour it in
 shall never leak though it do work as strong
 as aconitum or rash gunpowder
clarence i shall observe him with all care and love
king henry iv why art thou not at windsor with him thomas
clarence he is not there today he dines in london
king henry iv and how accompanied canst thou tell that
clarence with poins and other his continual followers
king henry iv most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
 and he the noble image of my youth
 is overspread with them therefore my grief
 stretches itself beyond the hour of death
 the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape
 in forms imaginary the unguided days
 and rotten times that you shall look upon
 when i am sleeping with my ancestors
 for when his headstrong riot hath no curb
 when rage and hot blood are his counsellors
 when means and lavish manners meet together
 o with what wings shall his affections fly
 towards fronting peril and opposed decay
warwick my gracious lord you look beyond him quite
 the prince but studies his companions
 like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
 tis needful that the most immodest word
 be look'd upon and learn'd which once attain'd
 your highness knows comes to no further use
 but to be known and hated so like gross terms
 the prince will in the perfectness of time
 cast off his followers and their memory
 shall as a pattern or a measure live
 by which his grace must mete the lives of others
 turning past evils to advantages
king henry iv tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
 in the dead carrion

 there is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd
 but peace puts forth her olive every where

 here at more leisure may your highness read
 with every course in his particular
king henry iv o westmoreland thou art a summer bird
 which ever in the haunch of winter sings
 the lifting up of day
 enter harcourt
 look here's more news
harcourt from enemies heaven keep your majesty
 and when they stand against you may they fall

 the earl northumberland and the lord bardolph
 with a great power of english and of scots
 are by the sheriff of yorkshire overthrown
 the manner and true order of the fight
 this packet please it you contains at large
king henry iv and wherefore should these good news make me sick
 will fortune never come with both hands full
 but write her fair words still in foulest letters
 she either gives a stomach and no food
 such are the poor in health or else a feast
 and takes away the stomach such are the rich
 that have abundance and enjoy it not
 i should rejoice now at this happy news
 and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
 o me come near me now i am much ill
gloucester comfort your majesty
clarence o my royal father
westmoreland my sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up
warwick be patient princes you do know these fits
 are with his highness very ordinary
 stand from him give him air he'll straight be well
clarence no no he cannot long hold out these pangs
 the incessant care and labour of his mind
 hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
 so thin that life looks through and will break out
gloucester the people fear me for they do observe
 unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature
 the seasons change their manners as the year
 had found some months asleep and leap'd them over
clarence the river hath thrice flow'd no ebb between
 and the old folk time's doting chronicles
 say it did so a little time before
 that our greatgrandsire edward sick'd and died

king henry iv let there be no noise made my gentle friends

 will whisper music to my weary spirit
warwick call for the music in the other room
king henry iv set me the crown upon my pillow here

 how doth the king
gloucester exceeding ill
prince henry heard he the good news yet
 tell it him
gloucester he alter'd much upon the hearing it
prince henry if he be sick with joy he'll recover without physic
warwick not so much noise my lords sweet prince
 speak low
 the king your father is disposed to sleep
clarence let us withdraw into the other room
warwick will't please your grace to go along with us
prince henry no i will sit and watch here by the king
 exeunt all but prince henry
 why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
 being so troublesome a bedfellow
 o polish'd perturbation golden care
 that keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
 to many a watchful night sleep with it now
 yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
 as he whose brow with homely biggen bound
 snores out the watch of night o majesty
 when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
 like a rich armour worn in heat of day
 that scalds with safety by his gates of breath
 there lies a downy feather which stirs not
 did he suspire that light and weightless down
 perforce must move my gracious lord my father
 this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
 that from this golden rigol hath divorced
 so many english kings thy due from me
 is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
 which nature love and filial tenderness
 shall o dear father pay thee plenteously
 my due from thee is this imperial crown
 which as immediate as thy place and blood
 derives itself to me lo here it sits
 which god shall guard and put the world's whole strength
 into one giant arm it shall not force
 this lineal honour from me this from thee
 will i to mine leave as tis left to me

 who undertook to sit and watch by you
king henry iv the prince of wales where is he let me see him
 he is not here
warwick this door is open he is gone this way
gloucester he came not through the chamber where we stay'd
king henry iv where is the crown who took it from my pillow
warwick when we withdrew my liege we left it here
king henry iv the prince hath ta'en it hence go seek him out
 is he so hasty that he doth suppose
 my sleep my death
 find him my lord of warwick chide him hither
 exit warwick
 this part of his conjoins with my disease
 and helps to end me see sons what things you are
 how quickly nature falls into revolt
 when gold becomes her object
 for this the foolish overcareful fathers
 have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care
 their bones with industry
 for this they have engrossed and piled up
 the canker'd heaps of strangeachieved gold
 for this they have been thoughtful to invest
 their sons with arts and martial exercises
 when like the bee culling from every flower
 the virtuous sweets
 our thighs pack'd with wax our mouths with honey
 we bring it to the hive and like the bees
 are murdered for our pains this bitter taste
 yield his engrossments to the ending father
 reenter warwick
 now where is he that will not stay so long
 till his friend sickness hath determined me
warwick my lord i found the prince in the next room
 washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
 with such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
 that tyranny which never quaff'd but blood
 would by beholding him have wash'd his knife
 with gentle eyedrops he is coming hither
king henry iv but wherefore did he take away the crown
 reenter prince henry
 lo where he comes come hither to me harry
 depart the chamber leave us here alone
 exeunt warwick and the rest
prince henry i never thought to hear you speak again
king henry iv thy wish was father harry to that thought
 i stay too long by thee i weary thee
 dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
 that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
 before thy hour be ripe o foolish youth
 thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee
 stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
 is held from falling with so weak a wind
 that it will quickly drop my day is dim
 thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
 were thine without offence and at my death
 thou hast seal'd up my expectation
 thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not
 and thou wilt have me die assured of it
 thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
 which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
 to stab at half an hour of my life
 what canst thou not forbear me half an hour
 then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
 and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
 that thou art crowned not that i am dead
 let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
 be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
 only compound me with forgotten dust
 give that which gave thee life unto the worms
 pluck down my officers break my decrees
 for now a time is come to mock at form
 harry the fifth is crown'd up vanity
 down royal state all you sage counsellors hence
 and to the english court assemble now
 from every region apes of idleness
 now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
 have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
 revel the night rob murder and commit
 the oldest sins the newest kind of ways
 be happy he will trouble you no more
 england shall double gild his treble guilt
 england shall give him office honour might
 for the fifth harry from curb'd licence plucks
 the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
 shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
 o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
 when that my care could not withhold thy riots
 what wilt thou do when riot is thy care
 o thou wilt be a wilderness again
 peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants
prince henry o pardon me my liege but for my tears
 the moist impediments unto my speech
 i had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
 ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard
 the course of it so far there is your crown
 and he that wears the crown immortally
 long guard it yours if i affect it more
 than as your honour and as your renown
 let me no more from this obedience rise
 which my most inward true and duteous spirit
 teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
 god witness with me when i here came in
 and found no course of breath within your majesty
 how cold it struck my heart if i do feign
 o let me in my present wildness die
 and never live to show the incredulous world
 the noble change that i have purposed
 coming to look on you thinking you dead
 and dead almost my liege to think you were
 i spake unto this crown as having sense
 and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending
 hath fed upon the body of my father
 therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
 other less fine in carat is more precious
 preserving life in medicine potable
 but thou most fine most honour'd most renown'd
 hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege
 accusing it i put it on my head
 to try with it as with an enemy
 that had before my face murder'd my father
 the quarrel of a true inheritor
 but if it did infect my blood with joy
 or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
 if any rebel or vain spirit of mine
 did with the least affection of a welcome
 give entertainment to the might of it
 let god for ever keep it from my head
 and make me as the poorest vassal is
 that doth with awe and terror kneel to it
king henry iv o my son
 god put it in thy mind to take it hence
 that thou mightst win the more thy father's love
 pleading so wisely in excuse of it
 come hither harry sit thou by my bed
 and hear i think the very latest counsel
 that ever i shall breathe god knows my son
 by what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways
 i met this crown and i myself know well
 how troublesome it sat upon my head
 to thee it shall descend with bitter quiet
 better opinion better confirmation
 for all the soil of the achievement goes
 with me into the earth it seem'd in me
 but as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand
 and i had many living to upbraid
 my gain of it by their assistances
 which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
 wounding supposed peace all these bold fears
 thou see'st with peril i have answered
 for all my reign hath been but as a scene
 acting that argument and now my death
 changes the mode for what in me was purchased
 falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
 so thou the garland wear'st successively
 yet though thou stand'st more sure than i could do
 thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
 and all my friends which thou must make thy friends
 have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out
 by whose fell working i was first advanced
 and by whose power i well might lodge a fear
 to be again displaced which to avoid
 i cut them off and had a purpose now
 to lead out many to the holy land
 lest rest and lying still might make them look
 too near unto my state therefore my harry
 be it thy course to busy giddy minds
 with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
 may waste the memory of the former days
 more would i but my lungs are wasted so
 that strength of speech is utterly denied me
 how i came by the crown o god forgive
 and grant it may with thee in true peace live
prince henry my gracious liege
 you won it wore it kept it gave it me
 then plain and right must my possession be
 which i with more than with a common pain
 gainst all the world will rightfully maintain
 enter lord john of lancaster
king henry iv look look here comes my john of lancaster
lancaster health peace and happiness to my royal father
king henry iv thou bring'st me happiness and peace son john

 bid him come hither sir john you shall not be excused
davy marry sir thus those precepts cannot be served
 and again sir shall we sow the headland with wheat
shallow with red wheat davy but for william cook are
 there no young pigeons
davy yes sir here is now the smith's note for shoeing
 and ploughirons
shallow let it be cast and paid sir john you shall not be excused
davy now sir a new link to the bucket must need be
 had and sir do you mean to stop any of william's
 wages about the sack he lost the other day at
 hinckley fair
shallow a shall answer it some pigeons davy a couple
 of shortlegged hens a joint of mutton and any
 pretty little tiny kickshaws tell william cook
davy doth the man of war stay all night sir
shallow yea davy i will use him well a friend i the
 court is better than a penny in purse use his men
 well davy for they are arrant knaves and will backbite
davy no worse than they are backbitten sir for they
 have marvellous foul linen
shallow well conceited davy about thy business davy
davy i beseech you sir to countenance william visor of
 woncot against clement perkes of the hill
shallow there is many complaints davy against that visor
 that visor is an arrant knave on my knowledge
davy i grant your worship that he is a knave sir but
 yet god forbid sir but a knave should have some
 countenance at his friend's request an honest
 man sir is able to speak for himself when a knave
 is not i have served your worship truly sir
 this eight years and if i cannot once or twice in
 a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man i
 have but a very little credit with your worship the
 knave is mine honest friend sir therefore i
 beseech your worship let him be countenanced
shallow go to i say he shall have no wrong look about davy
 exit davy
 where are you sir john come come come off
 with your boots give me your hand master bardolph

 come sir john
falstaff i'll follow you good master robert shallow
 exit shallow
 bardolph look to our horses
 exeunt bardolph and page
 if i were sawed into quantities i should make four
 dozen of such bearded hermits staves as master
 shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the
 semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his
 they by observing of him do bear themselves like
 foolish justices he by conversing with them is
 turned into a justicelike servingman their
 spirits are so married in conjunction with the
 participation of society that they flock together in
 consent like so many wildgeese if i had a suit
 to master shallow i would humour his men with the
 imputation of being near their master if to his
 men i would curry with master shallow that no man
 could better command his servants it is certain
 that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
 caught as men take diseases one of another
 therefore let men take heed of their company i
 will devise matter enough out of this shallow to
 keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing
 out of six fashions which is four terms or two
 actions and a shall laugh without intervallums o
 it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
 with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
 had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him
 laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up

 this is the english not the turkish court
 not amurath an amurath succeeds
 but harry harry yet be sad good brothers
 for by my faith it very well becomes you
 sorrow so royally in you appears
 that i will deeply put the fashion on
 and wear it in my heart why then be sad
 but entertain no more of it good brothers
 than a joint burden laid upon us all
 for me by heaven i bid you be assured
 i'll be your father and your brother too
 let me but bear your love i ll bear your cares
 yet weep that harry's dead and so will i
 but harry lives that shall convert those tears
 by number into hours of happiness
princes we hope no other from your majesty
king henry v you all look strangely on me and you most
 you are i think assured i love you not
lord chiefjustice i am assured if i be measured rightly
 your majesty hath no just cause to hate me
king henry v no
 how might a prince of my great hopes forget
 so great indignities you laid upon me
 what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
 the immediate heir of england was this easy
 may this be wash'd in lethe and forgotten
lord chiefjustice i then did use the person of your father
 the image of his power lay then in me
 and in the administration of his law
 whiles i was busy for the commonwealth
 your highness pleased to forget my place
 the majesty and power of law and justice
 the image of the king whom i presented
 and struck me in my very seat of judgment
 whereon as an offender to your father
 i gave bold way to my authority
 and did commit you if the deed were ill
 be you contented wearing now the garland
 to have a son set your decrees at nought
 to pluck down justice from your awful bench
 to trip the course of law and blunt the sword
 that guards the peace and safety of your person
 nay more to spurn at your most royal image
 and mock your workings in a second body
 question your royal thoughts make the case yours
 be now the father and propose a son
 hear your own dignity so much profaned
 see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
 behold yourself so by a son disdain'd
 and then imagine me taking your part
 and in your power soft silencing your son
 after this cold considerance sentence me
 and as you are a king speak in your state
 what i have done that misbecame my place
 my person or my liege's sovereignty
king henry v you are right justice and you weigh this well
 therefore still bear the balance and the sword
 and i do wish your honours may increase
 till you do live to see a son of mine
 offend you and obey you as i did
 so shall i live to speak my father's words
 happy am i that have a man so bold
 that dares do justice on my proper son
 and not less happy having such a son
 that would deliver up his greatness so
 into the hands of justice you did commit me
 for which i do commit into your hand
 the unstained sword that you have used to bear
 with this remembrance that you use the same
 with the like bold just and impartial spirit
 as you have done gainst me there is my hand
 you shall be as a father to my youth
 my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
 and i will stoop and humble my intents
 to your wellpractised wise directions
 and princes all believe me i beseech you
 my father is gone wild into his grave
 for in his tomb lie my affections
 and with his spirit sadly i survive
 to mock the expectation of the world
 to frustrate prophecies and to raze out
 rotten opinion who hath writ me down
 after my seeming the tide of blood in me
 hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now
 now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
 where it shall mingle with the state of floods
 and flow henceforth in formal majesty
 now call we our high court of parliament
 and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
 that the great body of our state may go
 in equal rank with the best govern'd nation
 that war or peace or both at once may be
 as things acquainted and familiar to us
 in which you father shall have foremost hand
 our coronation done we will accite
 as i before remember'd all our state
 and god consigning to my good intents
 no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say
 god shorten harry's happy life one day

 epilogue
 spoken by a dancer
 first my fear then my courtesy last my speech
 my fear is your displeasure my courtesy my duty
 and my speech to beg your pardons if you look
 for a good speech now you undo me for what i have
 to say is of mine own making and what indeed i
 should say will i doubt prove mine own marring
 but to the purpose and so to the venture be it
 known to you as it is very well i was lately here
 in the end of a displeasing play to pray your
 patience for it and to promise you a better i
 meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an
 ill venture it come unluckily home i break and
 you my gentle creditors lose here i promised you
 i would be and here i commit my body to your
 mercies bate me some and i will pay you some and
 as most debtors do promise you infinitely
 if my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will
 you command me to use my legs and yet that were but
 light payment to dance out of your debt but a
 good conscience will make any possible satisfaction
 and so would i all the gentlewomen here have
 forgiven me if the gentlemen will not then the
 gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which
 was never seen before in such an assembly
 one word more i beseech you if you be not too
 much cloyed with fat meat our humble author will
 continue the story with sir john in it and make
 you merry with fair katharine of france where for
 any thing i know falstaff shall die of a sweat
 unless already a be killed with your hard
 opinions for oldcastle died a martyr and this is
 not the man my tongue is weary when my legs are
 too i will bid you good night and so kneel down
 before you but indeed to pray for the queen

act i
scene i london the palace
 flourish of trumpets then hautboys enter king
 henry vi gloucester salisbury warwick and
 cardinal on the one side queen margaret suffolk
 york somerset and buckingham on the other
suffolk as by your high imperial majesty
 i had in charge at my depart for france
 as procurator to your excellence
 to marry princess margaret for your grace
 so in the famous ancient city tours
 in presence of the kings of france and sicil
 the dukes of orleans calaber bretagne and alencon
 seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops
 i have perform'd my task and was espoused
 and humbly now upon my bended knee
 in sight of england and her lordly peers
 deliver up my title in the queen
 to your most gracious hands that are the substance
 of that great shadow i did represent
 the happiest gift that ever marquess gave
 the fairest queen that ever king received
king henry vi suffolk arise welcome queen margaret
 i can express no kinder sign of love
 than this kind kiss o lord that lends me life
 lend me a heart replete with thankfulness
 for thou hast given me in this beauteous face
 a world of earthly blessings to my soul
 if sympathy of love unite our thoughts
queen margaret great king of england and my gracious lord
 the mutual conference that my mind hath had
 by day by night waking and in my dreams
 in courtly company or at my beads
 with you mine alderliefest sovereign
 makes me the bolder to salute my king
 with ruder terms such as my wit affords
 and overjoy of heart doth minister
king henry vi her sight did ravish but her grace in speech
 her words yclad with wisdom's majesty
 makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys
 such is the fulness of my heart's content
 lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love
all kneeling long live queen margaret england's
 happiness
queen margaret we thank you all
 flourish
suffolk my lord protector so it please your grace
 here are the articles of contracted peace
 between our sovereign and the french king charles
 for eighteen months concluded by consent
gloucester reads imprimis it is agreed between the french
 king charles and william de la pole marquess of
 suffolk ambassador for henry king of england that
 the said henry shall espouse the lady margaret
 daughter unto reignier king of naples sicilia and
 jerusalem and crown her queen of england ere the
 thirtieth of may next ensuing item that the duchy
 of anjou and the county of maine shall be released
 and delivered to the king her father'
 lets the paper fall
king henry vi uncle how now
gloucester pardon me gracious lord
 some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
 and dimm'd mine eyes that i can read no further
king henry vi uncle of winchester i pray read on
cardinal reads item it is further agreed between them
 that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be
 released and delivered over to the king her father
 and she sent over of the king of england's own
 proper cost and charges without having any dowry'
king henry vi they please us well lord marquess kneel down
 we here create thee the first duke of suffolk
 and gird thee with the sword cousin of york
 we here discharge your grace from being regent
 i the parts of france till term of eighteen months
 be full expired thanks uncle winchester
 gloucester york buckingham somerset
 salisbury and warwick
 we thank you all for the great favour done
 in entertainment to my princely queen
 come let us in and with all speed provide
 to see her coronation be perform'd
 exeunt king henry vi queen margaret and suffolk
gloucester brave peers of england pillars of the state
 to you duke humphrey must unload his grief
 your grief the common grief of all the land
 what did my brother henry spend his youth
 his valour coin and people in the wars
 did he so often lodge in open field
 in winter's cold and summer's parching heat
 to conquer france his true inheritance
 and did my brother bedford toil his wits
 to keep by policy what henry got
 have you yourselves somerset buckingham
 brave york salisbury and victorious warwick
 received deep scars in france and normandy
 or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself
 with all the learned council of the realm
 studied so long sat in the councilhouse
 early and late debating to and fro
 how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe
 and had his highness in his infancy
 crowned in paris in despite of foes
 and shall these labours and these honours die
 shall henry's conquest bedford's vigilance
 your deeds of war and all our counsel die
 o peers of england shameful is this league
 fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
 blotting your names from books of memory
 razing the characters of your renown
 defacing monuments of conquer'd france
 undoing all as all had never been
cardinal nephew what means this passionate discourse
 this peroration with such circumstance
 for france tis ours and we will keep it still
gloucester ay uncle we will keep it if we can
 but now it is impossible we should
 suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast
 hath given the duchy of anjou and maine
 unto the poor king reignier whose large style
 agrees not with the leanness of his purse
salisbury now by the death of him that died for all
 these counties were the keys of normandy
 but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son
warwick for grief that they are past recovery
 for were there hope to conquer them again
 my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
 anjou and maine myself did win them both
 those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
 and are the cities that i got with wounds
 delivered up again with peaceful words
 mort dieu
york for suffolk's duke may he be suffocate
 that dims the honour of this warlike isle
 france should have torn and rent my very heart
 before i would have yielded to this league
 i never read but england's kings have had
 large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
 and our king henry gives away his own
 to match with her that brings no vantages
gloucester a proper jest and never heard before
 that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
 for costs and charges in transporting her
 she should have stayed in france and starved
 in france before
cardinal my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot
 it was the pleasure of my lord the king
gloucester my lord of winchester i know your mind
 tis not my speeches that you do mislike
 but tis my presence that doth trouble ye
 rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
 i see thy fury if i longer stay
 we shall begin our ancient bickerings
 lordings farewell and say when i am gone
 i prophesied france will be lost ere long
 exit
cardinal so there goes our protector in a rage
 tis known to you he is mine enemy
 nay more an enemy unto you all
 and no great friend i fear me to the king
 consider lords he is the next of blood
 and heir apparent to the english crown
 had henry got an empire by his marriage
 and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
 there's reason he should be displeased at it
 look to it lords let not his smoothing words
 bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
 what though the common people favour him
 calling him humphrey the good duke of
 gloucester'
 clapping their hands and crying with loud voice
 jesu maintain your royal excellence'
 with god preserve the good duke humphrey'
 i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
 he will be found a dangerous protector
buckingham why should he then protect our sovereign
 he being of age to govern of himself
 cousin of somerset join you with me
 and all together with the duke of suffolk
 we'll quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat
cardinal this weighty business will not brook delay
 i'll to the duke of suffolk presently
 exit
somerset cousin of buckingham though humphrey's pride
 and greatness of his place be grief to us
 yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
 his insolence is more intolerable
 than all the princes in the land beside
 if gloucester be displaced he'll be protector
buckingham or thou or i somerset will be protector
 despite duke humphrey or the cardinal
 exeunt buckingham and somerset
salisbury pride went before ambition follows him
 while these do labour for their own preferment
 behoves it us to labour for the realm
 i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester
 did bear him like a noble gentleman
 oft have i seen the haughty cardinal
 more like a soldier than a man o the church
 as stout and proud as he were lord of all
 swear like a ruffian and demean himself
 unlike the ruler of a commonweal
 warwick my son the comfort of my age
 thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping
 hath won the greatest favour of the commons
 excepting none but good duke humphrey
 and brother york thy acts in ireland
 in bringing them to civil discipline
 thy late exploits done in the heart of france
 when thou wert regent for our sovereign
 have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people
 join we together for the public good
 in what we can to bridle and suppress
 the pride of suffolk and the cardinal
 with somerset's and buckingham's ambition
 and as we may cherish duke humphrey's deeds
 while they do tend the profit of the land
warwick so god help warwick as he loves the land
 and common profit of his country
york aside and so says york for he hath greatest cause
salisbury then let's make haste away and look unto the main
warwick unto the main o father maine is lost
 that maine which by main force warwick did win
 and would have kept so long as breath did last
 main chance father you meant but i meant maine
 which i will win from france or else be slain
 exeunt warwick and salisbury
york anjou and maine are given to the french
 paris is lost the state of normandy
 stands on a tickle point now they are gone
 suffolk concluded on the articles
 the peers agreed and henry was well pleased
 to change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter
 i cannot blame them all what is't to them
 tis thine they give away and not their own
 pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
 and purchase friends and give to courtezans
 still revelling like lords till all be gone
 while as the silly owner of the goods
 weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
 and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
 while all is shared and all is borne away
 ready to starve and dare not touch his own
 so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue
 while his own lands are bargain'd for and sold
 methinks the realms of england france and ireland
 bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
 as did the fatal brand althaea burn'd
 unto the prince's heart of calydon
 anjou and maine both given unto the french
 cold news for me for i had hope of france
 even as i have of fertile england's soil
 a day will come when york shall claim his own
 and therefore i will take the nevils parts
 and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey
 and when i spy advantage claim the crown
 for that's the golden mark i seek to hit
 nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right
 nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
 nor wear the diadem upon his head
 whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown
 then york be still awhile till time do serve
 watch thou and wake when others be asleep
 to pry into the secrets of the state
 till henry surfeiting in joys of love
 with his new bride and england's dearbought queen
 and humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars
 then will i raise aloft the milkwhite rose
 with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed
 and in my standard bear the arms of york
 to grapple with the house of lancaster
 and force perforce i'll make him yield the crown
 whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair england down

scene ii gloucester's house
 enter gloucester and his duchess
duchess why droops my lord like overripen'd corn
 hanging the head at ceres plenteous load
 why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows
 as frowning at the favours of the world
 why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth
 gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
 what seest thou there king henry's diadem
 enchased with all the honours of the world
 if so gaze on and grovel on thy face
 until thy head be circled with the same
 put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
 what is't too short i'll lengthen it with mine
 and having both together heaved it up
 we'll both together lift our heads to heaven
 and never more abase our sight so low
 as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground
gloucester o nell sweet nell if thou dost love thy lord
 banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
 and may that thought when i imagine ill
 against my king and nephew virtuous henry
 be my last breathing in this mortal world
 my troublous dream this night doth make me sad
duchess what dream'd my lord tell me and i'll requite it
 with sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream
gloucester methought this staff mine officebadge in court
 was broke in twain by whom i have forgot
 but as i think it was by the cardinal
 and on the pieces of the broken wand
 were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset
 and william de la pole first duke of suffolk
 this was my dream what it doth bode god knows
duchess tut this was nothing but an argument
 that he that breaks a stick of gloucester's grove
 shall lose his head for his presumption
 but list to me my humphrey my sweet duke
 methought i sat in seat of majesty
 in the cathedral church of westminster
 and in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd
 where henry and dame margaret kneel'd to me
 and on my head did set the diadem
gloucester nay eleanor then must i chide outright
 presumptuous dame illnurtured eleanor
 art thou not second woman in the realm
 and the protector's wife beloved of him
 hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
 above the reach or compass of thy thought
 and wilt thou still be hammering treachery
 to tumble down thy husband and thyself
 from top of honour to disgrace's feet
 away from me and let me hear no more
duchess what what my lord are you so choleric
 with eleanor for telling but her dream
 next time i'll keep my dreams unto myself
 and not be cheque'd
gloucester nay be not angry i am pleased again
 enter messenger
messenger my lord protector tis his highness pleasure
 you do prepare to ride unto saint alban's
 where as the king and queen do mean to hawk
gloucester i go come nell thou wilt ride with us
duchess yes my good lord i'll follow presently
 exeunt gloucester and messenger
 follow i must i cannot go before
 while gloucester bears this base and humble mind
 were i a man a duke and next of blood
 i would remove these tedious stumblingblocks
 and smooth my way upon their headless necks
 and being a woman i will not be slack
 to play my part in fortune's pageant
 where are you there sir john nay fear not man
 we are alone here's none but thee and i
 enter hume
hume jesus preserve your royal majesty
duchess what say'st thou majesty i am but grace
hume but by the grace of god and hume's advice
 your grace's title shall be multiplied
duchess what say'st thou man hast thou as yet conferr'd
 with margery jourdain the cunning witch
 with roger bolingbroke the conjurer
 and will they undertake to do me good
hume this they have promised to show your highness
 a spirit raised from depth of underground
 that shall make answer to such questions
 as by your grace shall be propounded him
duchess it is enough i'll think upon the questions
 when from st alban's we do make return
 we'll see these things effected to the full
 here hume take this reward make merry man
 with thy confederates in this weighty cause
 exit
hume hume must make merry with the duchess gold
 marry and shall but how now sir john hume
 seal up your lips and give no words but mum
 the business asketh silent secrecy
 dame eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
 gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
 yet have i gold flies from another coast
 i dare not say from the rich cardinal
 and from the great and newmade duke of suffolk
 yet i do find it so for to be plain
 they knowing dame eleanor's aspiring humour
 have hired me to undermine the duchess
 and buz these conjurations in her brain
 they say a crafty knave does need no broker'
 yet am i suffolk and the cardinal's broker
 hume if you take not heed you shall go near
 to call them both a pair of crafty knaves
 well so it stands and thus i fear at last
 hume's knavery will be the duchess wreck
 and her attainture will be humphrey's fall
 sort how it will i shall have gold for all

suffolk how now fellow would'st anything with me
first petitioner i pray my lord pardon me i took ye for my lord
 protector
queen margaret reading to my lord protector are your
 supplications to his lordship let me see them
 what is thine
first petitioner mine is an't please your grace against john
 goodman my lord cardinal's man for keeping my
 house and lands and wife and all from me
suffolk thy wife too that's some wrong indeed what's

 reads
 against the duke of suffolk for enclosing the
 commons of melford how now sir knave
second petitioner alas sir i am but a poor petitioner of our whole township
peter giving his petition against my master thomas
 horner for saying that the duke of york was rightful
 heir to the crown
queen margaret what sayst thou did the duke of york say he was
 rightful heir to the crown
peter that my master was no forsooth my master said
 that he was and that the king was an usurper
suffolk who is there
 enter servant
 take this fellow in and send for
 his master with a pursuivant presently we'll hear
 more of your matter before the king
 exit servant with peter
queen margaret and as for you that love to be protected
 under the wings of our protector's grace
 begin your suits anew and sue to him
 tears the supplication
 away base cullions suffolk let them go
all come let's be gone
 exeunt
queen margaret my lord of suffolk say is this the guise
 is this the fashion in the court of england
 is this the government of britain's isle
 and this the royalty of albion's king
 what shall king henry be a pupil still
 under the surly gloucester's governance
 am i a queen in title and in style
 and must be made a subject to a duke
 i tell thee pole when in the city tours
 thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
 and stolest away the ladies hearts of france
 i thought king henry had resembled thee
 in courage courtship and proportion
 but all his mind is bent to holiness
 to number avemaries on his beads
 his champions are the prophets and apostles
 his weapons holy saws of sacred writ
 his study is his tiltyard and his loves
 are brazen images of canonized saints
 i would the college of the cardinals
 would choose him pope and carry him to rome
 and set the triple crown upon his head
 that were a state fit for his holiness
suffolk madam be patient as i was cause
 your highness came to england so will i
 in england work your grace's full content
queen margaret beside the haughty protector have we beaufort
 the imperious churchman somerset buckingham
 and grumbling york and not the least of these
 but can do more in england than the king
suffolk and he of these that can do most of all
 cannot do more in england than the nevils
 salisbury and warwick are no simple peers
queen margaret not all these lords do vex me half so much
 as that proud dame the lord protector's wife
 she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
 more like an empress than duke humphrey's wife
 strangers in court do take her for the queen
 she bears a duke's revenues on her back
 and in her heart she scorns our poverty
 shall i not live to be avenged on her
 contemptuous baseborn callet as she is
 she vaunted mongst her minions t'other day
 the very train of her worst wearing gown
 was better worth than all my father's lands
 till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
suffolk madam myself have limed a bush for her
 and placed a quire of such enticing birds
 that she will light to listen to the lays
 and never mount to trouble you again
 so let her rest and madam list to me
 for i am bold to counsel you in this
 although we fancy not the cardinal
 yet must we join with him and with the lords
 till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace
 as for the duke of york this late complaint
 will make but little for his benefit
 so one by one we'll weed them all at last
 and you yourself shall steer the happy helm
 sound a sennet enter king henry vi gloucester
 cardinal buckingham york somerset salisbury
 warwick and the duchess
king henry vi for my part noble lords i care not which
 or somerset or york all's one to me
york if york have ill demean'd himself in france
 then let him be denay'd the regentship
somerset if somerset be unworthy of the place
 let york be regent i will yield to him
warwick whether your grace be worthy yea or no
 dispute not that york is the worthier
cardinal ambitious warwick let thy betters speak
warwick the cardinal's not my better in the field
buckingham all in this presence are thy betters warwick
warwick warwick may live to be the best of all
salisbury peace son and show some reason buckingham
 why somerset should be preferred in this
queen margaret because the king forsooth will have it so
gloucester madam the king is old enough himself
 to give his censure these are no women's matters
queen margaret if he be old enough what needs your grace
 to be protector of his excellence
gloucester madam i am protector of the realm
 and at his pleasure will resign my place
suffolk resign it then and leave thine insolence
 since thou wert kingas who is king but thou
 the commonwealth hath daily run to wreck
 the dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas
 and all the peers and nobles of the realm
 have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty
cardinal the commons hast thou rack'd the clergy's bags
 are lank and lean with thy extortions
somerset thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
 have cost a mass of public treasury
buckingham thy cruelty in execution
 upon offenders hath exceeded law
 and left thee to the mercy of the law
queen margaret they sale of offices and towns in france
 if they were known as the suspect is great
 would make thee quickly hop without thy head
 exit gloucester queen margaret drops her fan
 give me my fan what minion can ye not
 she gives the duchess a box on the ear
 i cry you mercy madam was it you
duchess was't i yea i it was proud frenchwoman
 could i come near your beauty with my nails
 i'd set my ten commandments in your face
king henry vi sweet aunt be quiet twas against her will
duchess against her will good king look to't in time
 she'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby
 though in this place most master wear no breeches
 she shall not strike dame eleanor unrevenged
 exit
buckingham lord cardinal i will follow eleanor
 and listen after humphrey how he proceeds
 she's tickled now her fume needs no spurs
 she'll gallop far enough to her destruction
 exit
 reenter gloucester
gloucester now lords my choler being overblown
 with walking once about the quadrangle
 i come to talk of commonwealth affairs
 as for your spiteful false objections
 prove them and i lie open to the law
 but god in mercy so deal with my soul
 as i in duty love my king and country
 but to the matter that we have in hand
 i say my sovereign york is meetest man
 to be your regent in the realm of france
suffolk before we make election give me leave
 to show some reason of no little force
 that york is most unmeet of any man
york i'll tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet
 first for i cannot flatter thee in pride
 next if i be appointed for the place
 my lord of somerset will keep me here
 without discharge money or furniture
 till france be won into the dauphin's hands
 last time i danced attendance on his will
 till paris was besieged famish'd and lost
warwick that can i witness and a fouler fact
 did never traitor in the land commit
suffolk peace headstrong warwick
warwick image of pride why should i hold my peace
 enter horner the armourer and his man
 peter guarded
suffolk because here is a man accused of treason
 pray god the duke of york excuse himself
york doth any one accuse york for a traitor
king henry vi what mean'st thou suffolk tell me what are these
suffolk please it your majesty this is the man
 that doth accuse his master of high treason
 his words were these that richard duke of york
 was rightful heir unto the english crown
 and that your majesty was a usurper
king henry vi say man were these thy words
horner an't shall please your majesty i never said nor
 thought any such matter god is my witness i am
 falsely accused by the villain
peter by these ten bones my lords he did speak them to
 me in the garret one night as we were scouring my
 lord of york's armour
york base dunghill villain and mechanical
 i'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech
 i do beseech your royal majesty
 let him have all the rigor of the law
horner alas my lord hang me if ever i spake the words
 my accuser is my prentice and when i did correct
 him for his fault the other day he did vow upon his
 knees he would be even with me i have good
 witness of this therefore i beseech your majesty
 do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
 accusation
king henry vi uncle what shall we say to this in law
gloucester this doom my lord if i may judge
 let somerset be regent over the french
 because in york this breeds suspicion
 and let these have a day appointed them
 for single combat in convenient place
 for he hath witness of his servant's malice
 this is the law and this duke humphrey's doom
somerset i humbly thank your royal majesty
horner and i accept the combat willingly
peter alas my lord i cannot fight for god's sake pity
 my case the spite of man prevaileth against me o
 lord have mercy upon me i shall never be able to
 fight a blow o lord my heart
gloucester sirrah or you must fight or else be hang'd
king henry vi away with them to prison and the day of combat
 shall be the last of the next month come
 somerset we'll see thee sent away

king henry vi but what a point my lord your falcon made
 and what a pitch she flew above the rest
 to see how god in all his creatures works
 yea man and birds are fain of climbing high
suffolk no marvel an it like your majesty
 my lord protector's hawks do tower so well
 they know their master loves to be aloft
 and bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch
gloucester my lord tis but a base ignoble mind
 that mounts no higher than a bird can soar
cardinal i thought as much he would be above the clouds
gloucester ay my lord cardinal how think you by that
 were it not good your grace could fly to heaven
king henry vi the treasury of everlasting joy
cardinal thy heaven is on earth thine eyes and thoughts

 enter buckingham
king henry vi what tidings with our cousin buckingham
buckingham such as my heart doth tremble to unfold
 a sort of naughty persons lewdly bent
 under the countenance and confederacy
 of lady eleanor the protector's wife
 the ringleader and head of all this rout
 have practised dangerously against your state
 dealing with witches and with conjurers
 whom we have apprehended in the fact
 raising up wicked spirits from under ground
 demanding of king henry's life and death
 and other of your highness privycouncil
 as more at large your grace shall understand
cardinal aside to gloucester and so my lord protector
 by this means
 your lady is forthcoming yet at london
 this news i think hath turn'd your weapon's edge
 tis like my lord you will not keep your hour
gloucester ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart
 sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers
 and vanquish'd as i am i yield to thee
 or to the meanest groom
king henry vi o god what mischiefs work the wicked ones
 heaping confusion on their own heads thereby
queen margaret gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest
 and look thyself be faultless thou wert best
gloucester madam for myself to heaven i do appeal
 how i have loved my king and commonweal
 and for my wife i know not how it stands
 sorry i am to hear what i have heard
 noble she is but if she have forgot
 honour and virtue and conversed with such
 as like to pitch defile nobility
 i banish her my bed and company
 and give her as a prey to law and shame
 that hath dishonour'd gloucester's honest name
king henry vi well for this night we will repose us here
 tomorrow toward london back again
 to look into this business thoroughly
 and call these foul offenders to their answers
 and poise the cause in justice equal scales
 whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails

act ii
scene ii london york's garden
 enter york salisbury and warwick
york now my good lords of salisbury and warwick
 our simple supper ended give me leave
 in this close walk to satisfy myself
 in craving your opinion of my title
 which is infallible to england's crown
salisbury my lord i long to hear it at full
warwick sweet york begin and if thy claim be good
 the nevils are thy subjects to command
york then thus
 edward the third my lords had seven sons
 the first edward the black prince prince of wales
 the second william of hatfield and the third
 lionel duke of clarence next to whom
 was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster
 the fifth was edmund langley duke of york
 the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester
 william of windsor was the seventh and last
 edward the black prince died before his father
 and left behind him richard his only son
 who after edward the third's death reign'd as king
 till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster
 the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt
 crown'd by the name of henry the fourth
 seized on the realm deposed the rightful king
 sent his poor queen to france from whence she came
 and him to pomfret where as all you know
 harmless richard was murder'd traitorously
warwick father the duke hath told the truth
 thus got the house of lancaster the crown
york which now they hold by force and not by right
 for richard the first son's heir being dead
 the issue of the next son should have reign'd
salisbury but william of hatfield died without an heir
york the third son duke of clarence from whose line
 i claimed the crown had issue philippe a daughter
 who married edmund mortimer earl of march
 edmund had issue roger earl of march
 roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor
salisbury this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke
 as i have read laid claim unto the crown
 and but for owen glendower had been king
 who kept him in captivity till he died
 but to the rest
york his eldest sister anne
 my mother being heir unto the crown
 married richard earl of cambridge who was son
 to edmund langley edward the third's fifth son
 by her i claim the kingdom she was heir
 to roger earl of march who was the son
 of edmund mortimer who married philippe
 sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence
 so if the issue of the elder son
 succeed before the younger i am king
warwick what plain proceeding is more plain than this
 henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt
 the fourth son york claims it from the third
 till lionel's issue fails his should not reign
 it fails not yet but flourishes in thee
 and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
 then father salisbury kneel we together
 and in this private plot be we the first
 that shall salute our rightful sovereign
 with honour of his birthright to the crown
both long live our sovereign richard england's king
york we thank you lords but i am not your king
 till i be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
 with heartblood of the house of lancaster
 and that's not suddenly to be perform'd
 but with advice and silent secrecy
 do you as i do in these dangerous days
 wink at the duke of suffolk's insolence
 at beaufort's pride at somerset's ambition
 at buckingham and all the crew of them
 till they have snared the shepherd of the flock
 that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey
 tis that they seek and they in seeking that
 shall find their deaths if york can prophesy
salisbury my lord break we off we know your mind at full
warwick my heart assures me that the earl of warwick
 shall one day make the duke of york a king
york and nevil this i do assure myself
 richard shall live to make the earl of warwick
 the greatest man in england but the king

scene iv a street
 enter gloucester and his servingmen in
 mourning cloaks
gloucester thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud
 and after summer evermore succeeds
 barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold
 so cares and joys abound as seasons fleet
 sirs what's o'clock
servants ten my lord
gloucester ten is the hour that was appointed me
 to watch the coming of my punish'd duchess
 uneath may she endure the flinty streets
 to tread them with her tenderfeeling feet
 sweet nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
 the abject people gazing on thy face
 with envious looks laughing at thy shame
 that erst did follow thy proud chariotwheels
 when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
 but soft i think she comes and i'll prepare
 my tearstain'd eyes to see her miseries
 enter the duchess in a white sheet and a taper
 burning in her hand with stanley the sheriff
 and officers
servant so please your grace we'll take her from the sheriff
gloucester no stir not for your lives let her pass by
duchess come you my lord to see my open shame
 now thou dost penance too look how they gaze
 see how the giddy multitude do point
 and nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee
 ah gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks
 and in thy closet pent up rue my shame
 and ban thine enemies both mine and thine
gloucester be patient gentle nell forget this grief
duchess ah gloucester teach me to forget myself
 for whilst i think i am thy married wife
 and thou a prince protector of this land
 methinks i should not thus be led along
 mail'd up in shame with papers on my back
 and followed with a rabble that rejoice
 to see my tears and hear my deepfet groans
 the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
 and when i start the envious people laugh
 and bid me be advised how i tread
 ah humphrey can i bear this shameful yoke
 trow'st thou that e'er i'll look upon the world
 or count them happy that enjoy the sun
 no dark shall be my light and night my day
 to think upon my pomp shall be my hell
 sometime i'll say i am duke humphrey's wife
 and he a prince and ruler of the land
 yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
 as he stood by whilst i his forlorn duchess
 was made a wonder and a pointingstock
 to every idle rascal follower
 but be thou mild and blush not at my shame
 nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
 hang over thee as sure it shortly will
 for suffolk he that can do all in all
 with her that hateth thee and hates us all
 and york and impious beaufort that false priest
 have all limed bushes to betray thy wings
 and fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee
 but fear not thou until thy foot be snared
 nor never seek prevention of thy foes
gloucester ah nell forbear thou aimest all awry
 i must offend before i be attainted
 and had i twenty times so many foes
 and each of them had twenty times their power
 all these could not procure me any scathe
 so long as i am loyal true and crimeless
 wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
 why yet thy scandal were not wiped away
 but i in danger for the breach of law
 thy greatest help is quiet gentle nell
 i pray thee sort thy heart to patience
 these few days wonder will be quickly worn

stanley why madam that is to the isle of man

 2 king henry vi
act iii
scene i the abbey at bury st edmund's
 sound a sennet enter king henry vi queen
 margaret cardinal suffolk york buckingham
 salisbury and warwick to the parliament
king henry vi i muse my lord of gloucester is not come
 tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
 whate'er occasion keeps him from us now
queen margaret can you not see or will ye not observe
 the strangeness of his alter'd countenance
 with what a majesty he bears himself
 how insolent of late he is become
 how proud how peremptory and unlike himself
 we know the time since he was mild and affable
 and if we did but glance a faroff look
 immediately he was upon his knee
 that all the court admired him for submission
 but meet him now and be it in the morn
 when every one will give the time of day
 he knits his brow and shows an angry eye
 and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
 disdaining duty that to us belongs
 small curs are not regarded when they grin
 but great men tremble when the lion roars
 and humphrey is no little man in england
 first note that he is near you in descent
 and should you fall he as the next will mount
 me seemeth then it is no policy
 respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
 and his advantage following your decease
 that he should come about your royal person
 or be admitted to your highness council
 by flattery hath he won the commons hearts
 and when he please to make commotion
 tis to be fear'd they all will follow him
 now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted
 suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden
 and choke the herbs for want of husbandry
 the reverent care i bear unto my lord
 made me collect these dangers in the duke
 if it be fond call it a woman's fear
 which fear if better reasons can supplant
 i will subscribe and say i wrong'd the duke
 my lord of suffolk buckingham and york
 reprove my allegation if you can
 or else conclude my words effectual
suffolk well hath your highness seen into this duke
 and had i first been put to speak my mind
 i think i should have told your grace's tale
 the duchess by his subornation
 upon my life began her devilish practises
 or if he were not privy to those faults
 yet by reputing of his high descent
 as next the king he was successive heir
 and such high vaunts of his nobility
 did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess
 by wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall
 smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
 and in his simple show he harbours treason
 the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
 no no my sovereign gloucester is a man
 unsounded yet and full of deep deceit
cardinal did he not contrary to form of law
 devise strange deaths for small offences done
york and did he not in his protectorship
 levy great sums of money through the realm
 for soldiers pay in france and never sent it
 by means whereof the towns each day revolted
buckingham tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
 which time will bring to light in smooth
 duke humphrey
king henry vi my lords at once the care you have of us
 to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
 is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience
 our kinsman gloucester is as innocent
 from meaning treason to our royal person
 as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
 the duke is virtuous mild and too well given
 to dream on evil or to work my downfall
queen margaret ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance
 seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed
 for he's disposed as the hateful raven
 is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him
 for he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf
 who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
 take heed my lord the welfare of us all
 hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
 enter somerset
somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign
king henry vi welcome lord somerset what news from france
somerset that all your interest in those territories
 is utterly bereft you all is lost
king henry vi cold news lord somerset but god's will be done
york aside cold news for me for i had hope of france
 as firmly as i hope for fertile england
 thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
 and caterpillars eat my leaves away
 but i will remedy this gear ere long
 or sell my title for a glorious grave
 enter gloucester
gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king
 pardon my liege that i have stay'd so long
suffolk nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon
 unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
 i do arrest thee of high treason here
gloucester well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
 nor change my countenance for this arrest
 a heart unspotted is not easily daunted
 the purest spring is not so free from mud
 as i am clear from treason to my sovereign
 who can accuse me wherein am i guilty
york tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france
 and being protector stayed the soldiers pay
 by means whereof his highness hath lost france
gloucester is it but thought so what are they that think it
 i never robb'd the soldiers of their pay
 nor ever had one penny bribe from france
 so help me god as i have watch'd the night
 ay night by night in studying good for england
 that doit that e'er i wrested from the king
 or any groat i hoarded to my use
 be brought against me at my trialday
 no many a pound of mine own proper store
 because i would not tax the needy commons
 have i disbursed to the garrisons
 and never ask'd for restitution
cardinal it serves you well my lord to say so much
gloucester i say no more than truth so help me god
york in your protectorship you did devise
 strange tortures for offenders never heard of
 that england was defamed by tyranny
gloucester why tis well known that whiles i was
 protector
 pity was all the fault that was in me
 for i should melt at an offender's tears
 and lowly words were ransom for their fault
 unless it were a bloody murderer
 or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers
 i never gave them condign punishment
 murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured
 above the felon or what trespass else
suffolk my lord these faults are easy quickly answered
 but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
 whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
 i do arrest you in his highness name
 and here commit you to my lord cardinal
 to keep until your further time of trial
king henry vi my lord of gloucester tis my special hope
 that you will clear yourself from all suspect
 my conscience tells me you are innocent
gloucester ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
 virtue is choked with foul ambition
 and charity chased hence by rancour's hand
 foul subornation is predominant
 and equity exiled your highness land
 i know their complot is to have my life
 and if my death might make this island happy
 and prove the period of their tyranny
 i would expend it with all willingness
 but mine is made the prologue to their play
 for thousands more that yet suspect no peril
 will not conclude their plotted tragedy
 beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice
 and suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate
 sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue
 the envious load that lies upon his heart
 and dogged york that reaches at the moon
 whose overweening arm i have pluck'd back
 by false accuse doth level at my life
 and you my sovereign lady with the rest
 causeless have laid disgraces on my head
 and with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
 my liefest liege to be mine enemy
 ay all you have laid your heads together
 myself had notice of your conventicles
 and all to make away my guiltless life
 i shall not want false witness to condemn me
 nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
 the ancient proverb will be well effected
 a staff is quickly found to beat a dog'
cardinal my liege his railing is intolerable
 if those that care to keep your royal person
 from treason's secret knife and traitors rage
 be thus upbraided chid and rated at
 and the offender granted scope of speech
 twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace
suffolk hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
 with ignominious words though clerkly couch'd
 as if she had suborned some to swear
 false allegations to o'erthrow his state
queen margaret but i can give the loser leave to chide
gloucester far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed
 beshrew the winners for they play'd me false
 and well such losers may have leave to speak
buckingham he'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
 lord cardinal he is your prisoner
cardinal sirs take away the duke and guard him sure
gloucester ah thus king henry throws away his crutch
 before his legs be firm to bear his body
 thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
 and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
 ah that my fear were false ah that it were
 for good king henry thy decay i fear
 exit guarded
king henry vi my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
 do or undo as if ourself were here
queen margaret what will your highness leave the parliament
king henry vi ay margaret my heart is drown'd with grief
 whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
 my body round engirt with misery
 for what's more miserable than discontent
 ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see
 the map of honour truth and loyalty
 and yet good humphrey is the hour to come
 that e'er i proved thee false or fear'd thy faith
 what louring star now envies thy estate
 that these great lords and margaret our queen
 do seek subversion of thy harmless life
 thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
 and as the butcher takes away the calf
 and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
 bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse
 even so remorseless have they borne him hence
 and as the dam runs lowing up and down
 looking the way her harmless young one went
 and can do nought but wail her darling's loss
 even so myself bewails good gloucester's case
 with sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes
 look after him and cannot do him good
 so mighty are his vowed enemies
 his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan
 say who's a traitor gloucester he is none'
 exeunt all but queen margaret cardinal
 suffolk and york somerset remains apart
queen margaret free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams
 henry my lord is cold in great affairs
 too full of foolish pity and gloucester's show
 beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
 with sorrow snares relenting passengers
 or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank
 with shining chequer'd slough doth sting a child
 that for the beauty thinks it excellent
 believe me lords were none more wise than i
 and yet herein i judge mine own wit good
 this gloucester should be quickly rid the world
 to rid us of the fear we have of him
cardinal that he should die is worthy policy
 but yet we want a colour for his death
 tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law
suffolk but in my mind that were no policy
 the king will labour still to save his life
 the commons haply rise to save his life
 and yet we have but trivial argument
 more than mistrust that shows him worthy death
york so that by this you would not have him die
suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as i
york tis york that hath more reason for his death
 but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk
 say as you think and speak it from your souls
 were't not all one an empty eagle were set
 to guard the chicken from a hungry kite
 as place duke humphrey for the king's protector
queen margaret so the poor chicken should be sure of death
suffolk madam tis true and were't not madness then
 to make the fox surveyor of the fold
 who being accused a crafty murderer
 his guilt should be but idly posted over
 because his purpose is not executed
 no let him die in that he is a fox
 by nature proved an enemy to the flock
 before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood
 as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege
 and do not stand on quillets how to slay him
 be it by gins by snares by subtlety
 sleeping or waking tis no matter how
 so he be dead for that is good deceit
 which mates him first that first intends deceit
queen margaret thricenoble suffolk tis resolutely spoke
suffolk not resolute except so much were done
 for things are often spoke and seldom meant
 but that my heart accordeth with my tongue
 seeing the deed is meritorious
 and to preserve my sovereign from his foe
 say but the word and i will be his priest
cardinal but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk
 ere you can take due orders for a priest
 say you consent and censure well the deed
 and i'll provide his executioner
 i tender so the safety of my liege
suffolk here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
queen margaret and so say i
york and i and now we three have spoke it
 it skills not greatly who impugns our doom
 enter a post
post great lords from ireland am i come amain
 to signify that rebels there are up
 and put the englishmen unto the sword
 send succors lords and stop the rage betime
 before the wound do grow uncurable
 for being green there is great hope of help
cardinal a breach that craves a quick expedient stop
 what counsel give you in this weighty cause
york that somerset be sent as regent thither
 tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd
 witness the fortune he hath had in france
somerset if york with all his farfet policy
 had been the regent there instead of me
 he never would have stay'd in france so long
york no not to lose it all as thou hast done
 i rather would have lost my life betimes
 than bring a burthen of dishonour home
 by staying there so long till all were lost
 show me one scar character'd on thy skin
 men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win
queen margaret nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
 if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
 no more good york sweet somerset be still
 thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there
 might happily have proved far worse than his
york what worse than nought nay then a shame take all
somerset and in the number thee that wishest shame
cardinal my lord of york try what your fortune is
 the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms
 and temper clay with blood of englishmen
 to ireland will you lead a band of men
 collected choicely from each county some
 and try your hap against the irishmen
york i will my lord so please his majesty
suffolk why our authority is his consent
 and what we do establish he confirms
 then noble york take thou this task in hand
york i am content provide me soldiers lords
 whiles i take order for mine own affairs
suffolk a charge lord york that i will see perform'd
 but now return we to the false duke humphrey
cardinal no more of him for i will deal with him
 that henceforth he shall trouble us no more
 and so break off the day is almost spent
 lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event
york my lord of suffolk within fourteen days
 at bristol i expect my soldiers
 for there i'll ship them all for ireland
suffolk i'll see it truly done my lord of york
 exeunt all but york
york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts
 and change misdoubt to resolution
 be that thou hopest to be or what thou art
 resign to death it is not worth the enjoying
 let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man
 and find no harbour in a royal heart
 faster than springtime showers comes thought
 on thought
 and not a thought but thinks on dignity
 my brain more busy than the labouring spider
 weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
 well nobles well tis politicly done
 to send me packing with an host of men
 i fear me you but warm the starved snake
 who cherish'd in your breasts will sting
 your hearts
 twas men i lack'd and you will give them me
 i take it kindly and yet be well assured
 you put sharp weapons in a madman's hands
 whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band
 i will stir up in england some black storm
 shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
 and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
 until the golden circuit on my head
 like to the glorious sun's transparent beams
 do calm the fury of this madbred flaw
 and for a minister of my intent
 i have seduced a headstrong kentishman
 john cade of ashford
 to make commotion as full well he can
 under the title of john mortimer
 in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade
 oppose himself against a troop of kerns
 and fought so long till that his thighs with darts
 were almost like a sharpquill'd porpentine
 and in the end being rescued i have seen
 him caper upright like a wild morisco
 shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
 full often like a shaghair'd crafty kern
 hath he conversed with the enemy
 and undiscover'd come to me again
 and given me notice of their villanies
 this devil here shall be my substitute
 for that john mortimer which now is dead
 in face in gait in speech he doth resemble
 by this i shall perceive the commons mind
 how they affect the house and claim of york
 say he be taken rack'd and tortured
 i know no pain they can inflict upon him
 will make him say i moved him to those arms
 say that he thrive as tis great like he will
 why then from ireland come i with my strength
 and reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd
 for humphrey being dead as he shall be
 and henry put apart the next for me

 and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
 for in the shade of death i shall find joy

 although the duke was enemy to him
 yet he most christianlike laments his death
 and for myself foe as he was to me
 might liquid tears or heartoffending groans
 or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life
 i would be blind with weeping sick with groans
 look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs
 and all to have the noble duke alive
 what know i how the world may deem of me
 for it is known we were but hollow friends
 it may be judged i made the duke away
 so shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded
 and princes courts be fill'd with my reproach
 this get i by his death ay me unhappy
 to be a queen and crown'd with infamy
king henry vi ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man
queen margaret be woe for me more wretched than he is
 what dost thou turn away and hide thy face
 i am no loathsome leper look on me
 what art thou like the adder waxen deaf
 be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
 is all thy comfort shut in gloucester's tomb
 why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy
 erect his statue and worship it
 and make my image but an alehouse sign
 was i for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
 and twice by awkward wind from england's bank
 drove back again unto my native clime
 what boded this but well forewarning wind
 did seem to say seek not a scorpion's nest
 nor set no footing on this unkind shore'
 what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts
 and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves
 and bid them blow towards england's blessed shore
 or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
 yet aeolus would not be a murderer
 but left that hateful office unto thee
 the prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me
 knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
 with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
 the splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
 and would not dash me with their ragged sides
 because thy flinty heart more hard than they
 might in thy palace perish margaret
 as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs
 when from thy shore the tempest beat us back
 i stood upon the hatches in the storm
 and when the dusky sky began to rob
 my earnestgaping sight of thy land's view
 i took a costly jewel from my neck
 a heart it was bound in with diamonds
 and threw it towards thy land the sea received it
 and so i wish'd thy body might my heart
 and even with this i lost fair england's view
 and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
 and call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
 for losing ken of albion's wished coast
 how often have i tempted suffolk's tongue
 the agent of thy foul inconstancy
 to sit and witch me as ascanius did
 when he to madding dido would unfold
 his father's acts commenced in burning troy
 am i not witch'd like her or thou not false like him
 ay me i can no more die margaret
 for henry weeps that thou dost live so long
 noise within enter warwick salisbury and many commons
warwick it is reported mighty sovereign
 that good duke humphrey traitorously is murder'd
 by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort's means
 the commons like an angry hive of bees
 that want their leader scatter up and down
 and care not who they sting in his revenge
 myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
 until they hear the order of his death
king henry vi that he is dead good warwick tis too true
 but how he died god knows not henry
 enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
 and comment then upon his sudden death
warwick that shall i do my liege stay salisbury
 with the rude multitude till i return
 exit
king henry vi o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
 my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
 some violent hands were laid on humphrey's life
 if my suspect be false forgive me god
 for judgment only doth belong to thee
 fain would i go to chafe his paly lips
 with twenty thousand kisses and to drain
 upon his face an ocean of salt tears
 to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
 and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
 but all in vain are these mean obsequies
 and to survey his dead and earthly image
 what were it but to make my sorrow greater
 reenter warwick and others bearing
 gloucester's body on a bed
warwick come hither gracious sovereign view this body
king henry vi that is to see how deep my grave is made
 for with his soul fled all my worldly solace
 for seeing him i see my life in death
warwick as surely as my soul intends to live
 with that dread king that took our state upon him
 to free us from his father's wrathful curse
 i do believe that violent hands were laid
 upon the life of this thricefamed duke
suffolk a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
 what instance gives lord warwick for his vow
warwick see how the blood is settled in his face
 oft have i seen a timelyparted ghost
 of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
 being all descended to the labouring heart
 who in the conflict that it holds with death
 attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy
 which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
 to blush and beautify the cheek again
 but see his face is black and full of blood
 his eyeballs further out than when he lived
 staring full ghastly like a strangled man
 his hair uprear'd his nostrils stretched with struggling
 his hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd
 and tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued
 look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
 his wellproportion'd beard made rough and rugged
 like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged
 it cannot be but he was murder'd here
 the least of all these signs were probable
suffolk why warwick who should do the duke to death
 myself and beaufort had him in protection
 and we i hope sir are no murderers
warwick but both of you were vow'd duke humphrey's foes
 and you forsooth had the good duke to keep
 tis like you would not feast him like a friend
 and tis well seen he found an enemy
queen margaret then you belike suspect these noblemen
 as guilty of duke humphrey's timeless death
warwick who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
 and sees fast by a butcher with an axe
 but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter
 who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest
 but may imagine how the bird was dead
 although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
 even so suspicious is this tragedy
queen margaret are you the butcher suffolk where's your knife
 is beaufort term'd a kite where are his talons
suffolk i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
 but here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease
 that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
 that slanders me with murder's crimson badge
 say if thou darest proud lord of warwickshire
 that i am faulty in duke humphrey's death
 exeunt cardinal somerset and others
warwick what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him
queen margaret he dares not calm his contumelious spirit
 nor cease to be an arrogant controller
 though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
warwick madam be still with reverence may i say
 for every word you speak in his behalf
 is slander to your royal dignity
suffolk bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanor
 if ever lady wrong'd her lord so much
 thy mother took into her blameful bed
 some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock
 was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art
 and never of the nevils noble race
warwick but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
 and i should rob the deathsman of his fee
 quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
 and that my sovereign's presence makes me mild
 i would false murderous coward on thy knee
 make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
 and say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
 that thou thyself was born in bastardy
 and after all this fearful homage done
 give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
 pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men
suffolk thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood
 if from this presence thou darest go with me
warwick away even now or i will drag thee hence
 unworthy though thou art i'll cope with thee
 and do some service to duke humphrey's ghost
 exeunt suffolk and warwick
king henry vi what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
 thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just
 and he but naked though lock'd up in steel
 whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
 a noise within
queen margaret what noise is this
 reenter suffolk and warwick with their
 weapons drawn
king henry vi why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
 here in our presence dare you be so bold
 why what tumultuous clamour have we here
suffolk the traitorous warwick with the men of bury
 set all upon me mighty sovereign
salisbury to the commons entering sirs stand apart
 the king shall know your mind
 dread lord the commons send you word by me
 unless lord suffolk straight be done to death
 or banished fair england's territories
 they will by violence tear him from your palace
 and torture him with grievous lingering death
 they say by him the good duke humphrey died
 they say in him they fear your highness death
 and mere instinct of love and loyalty
 free from a stubborn opposite intent
 as being thought to contradict your liking
 makes them thus forward in his banishment
 they say in care of your most royal person
 that if your highness should intend to sleep
 and charge that no man should disturb your rest
 in pain of your dislike or pain of death
 yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
 were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
 that slily glided towards your majesty
 it were but necessary you were waked
 lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber
 the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
 and therefore do they cry though you forbid
 that they will guard you whether you will or no
 from such fell serpents as false suffolk is
 with whose envenomed and fatal sting
 your loving uncle twenty times his worth
 they say is shamefully bereft of life
commons within an answer from the king my
 lord of salisbury
suffolk tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds
 could send such message to their sovereign
 but you my lord were glad to be employ'd
 to show how quaint an orator you are
 but all the honour salisbury hath won
 is that he was the lord ambassador
 sent from a sort of tinkers to the king
commons within an answer from the king or we will all break in
king henry vi go salisbury and tell them all from me
 i thank them for their tender loving care
 and had i not been cited so by them
 yet did i purpose as they do entreat
 for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
 mischance unto my state by suffolk's means
 and therefore by his majesty i swear
 whose far unworthy deputy i am
 he shall not breathe infection in this air
 but three days longer on the pain of death
 exit salisbury
queen margaret o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk
king henry vi ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk
 no more i say if thou dost plead for him
 thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
 had i but said i would have kept my word
 but when i swear it is irrevocable
 if after three days space thou here be'st found
 on any ground that i am ruler of
 the world shall not be ransom for thy life
 come warwick come good warwick go with me
 i have great matters to impart to thee
 exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk
queen margaret mischance and sorrow go along with you
 heart's discontent and sour affliction
 be playfellows to keep you company
 there's two of you the devil make a third
 and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
suffolk cease gentle queen these execrations
 and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave
queen margaret fie coward woman and softhearted wretch
 hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy
suffolk a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them
 would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan
 i would invent as bittersearching terms
 as curst as harsh and horrible to hear
 deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth
 with full as many signs of deadly hate
 as leanfaced envy in her loathsome cave
 my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
 mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
 mine hair be fixed on end as one distract
 ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
 and even now my burthen'd heart would break
 should i not curse them poison be their drink
 gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
 their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
 their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks
 their softest touch as smart as lizards sting
 their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
 and boding screechowls make the concert full
 all the foul terrors in darkseated hell
queen margaret enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself
 and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass
 or like an overcharged gun recoil
 and turn the force of them upon thyself
suffolk you bade me ban and will you bid me leave
 now by the ground that i am banish'd from
 well could i curse away a winter's night
 though standing naked on a mountain top
 where biting cold would never let grass grow
 and think it but a minute spent in sport
queen margaret o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand
 that i may dew it with my mournful tears
 nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
 to wash away my woful monuments
 o could this kiss be printed in thy hand
 that thou mightst think upon these by the seal
 through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee
 so get thee gone that i may know my grief
 tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by
 as one that surfeits thinking on a want
 i will repeal thee or be well assured
 adventure to be banished myself
 and banished i am if but from thee
 go speak not to me even now be gone
 o go not yet even thus two friends condemn'd
 embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
 loather a hundred times to part than die
 yet now farewell and farewell life with thee
suffolk thus is poor suffolk ten times banished
 once by the king and three times thrice by thee
 tis not the land i care for wert thou thence
 a wilderness is populous enough
 so suffolk had thy heavenly company
 for where thou art there is the world itself
 with every several pleasure in the world
 and where thou art not desolation
 i can no more live thou to joy thy life
 myself no joy in nought but that thou livest
 enter vaux
queen margaret wither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee
vaux to signify unto his majesty
 that cardinal beaufort is at point of death
 for suddenly a grievous sickness took him
 that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
 blaspheming god and cursing men on earth
 sometimes he talks as if duke humphrey's ghost
 were by his side sometime he calls the king
 and whispers to his pillow as to him
 the secrets of his overcharged soul
 and i am sent to tell his majesty
 that even now he cries aloud for him
queen margaret go tell this heavy message to the king
 exit vaux
 ay me what is this world what news are these
 but wherefore grieve i at an hour's poor loss
 omitting suffolk's exile my soul's treasure
 why only suffolk mourn i not for thee
 and with the southern clouds contend in tears
 theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows
 now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming
 if thou be found by me thou art but dead
suffolk if i depart from thee i cannot live
 and in thy sight to die what were it else
 but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
 here could i breathe my soul into the air
 as mild and gentle as the cradlebabe
 dying with mother's dug between its lips
 where from thy sight i should be raging mad
 and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
 to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
 so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
 or i should breathe it so into thy body
 and then it lived in sweet elysium
 to die by thee were but to die in jest
 from thee to die were torture more than death
 o let me stay befall what may befall
queen margaret away though parting be a fretful corrosive
 it is applied to a deathful wound
 to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee
 for wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe
 i'll have an iris that shall find thee out
suffolk i go
queen margaret and take my heart with thee
suffolk a jewel lock'd into the wofull'st cask
 that ever did contain a thing of worth
 even as a splitted bark so sunder we
 this way fall i to death
queen margaret this way for me
 exeunt severally

cardinal bring me unto my trial when you will

 comb down his hair look look it stands upright
 like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul
 give me some drink and bid the apothecary
 bring the strong poison that i bought of him
king henry vi o thou eternal mover of the heavens
 look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
 o beat away the busy meddling fiend
 that lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul
 and from his bosom purge this black despair
warwick see how the pangs of death do make him grin
salisbury disturb him not let him pass peaceably
king henry vi peace to his soul if god's good pleasure be
 lord cardinal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss
 hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
 he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him
warwick so bad a death argues a monstrous life
king henry vi forbear to judge for we are sinners all
 close up his eyes and draw the curtain close

act iv
scene i the coast of kent
 alarum fight at sea ordnance goes off enter a
 captain a master a master'smate walter whitmore
 and others with them suffolk and others prisoners
captain the gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
 is crept into the bosom of the sea
 and now loudhowling wolves arouse the jades
 that drag the tragic melancholy night
 who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
 clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
 breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
 therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
 for whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs
 here shall they make their ransom on the sand
 or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore
 master this prisoner freely give i thee
 and thou that art his mate make boot of this
 the other walter whitmore is thy share
first gentleman what is my ransom master let me know
master a thousand crowns or else lay down your head
master'smate and so much shall you give or off goes yours
captain what think you much to pay two thousand crowns
 and bear the name and port of gentlemen
 cut both the villains throats for die you shall
 the lives of those which we have lost in fight
 be counterpoised with such a petty sum
first gentleman i'll give it sir and therefore spare my life
second gentleman and so will i and write home for it straight
whitmore i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard
 and therefore to revenge it shalt thou die
 to suffolk
 and so should these if i might have my will
captain be not so rash take ransom let him live
suffolk look on my george i am a gentleman
 rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid
whitmore and so am i my name is walter whitmore
 how now why start'st thou what doth
 death affright
suffolk thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
 a cunning man did calculate my birth
 and told me that by water i should die
 yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded
 thy name is gaultier being rightly sounded
whitmore gaultier or walter which it is i care not
 never yet did base dishonour blur our name
 but with our sword we wiped away the blot
 therefore when merchantlike i sell revenge
 broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced
 and i proclaim'd a coward through the world
suffolk stay whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
 the duke of suffolk william de la pole
whitmore the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags
suffolk ay but these rags are no part of the duke
 jove sometimes went disguised and why not i
captain but jove was never slain as thou shalt be
suffolk obscure and lowly swain king henry's blood
 the honourable blood of lancaster
 must not be shed by such a jaded groom
 hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup
 bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule
 and thought thee happy when i shook my head
 how often hast thou waited at my cup
 fed from my trencher kneel'd down at the board
 when i have feasted with queen margaret
 remember it and let it make thee crestfall'n
 ay and allay this thy abortive pride
 how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
 and duly waited for my coming forth
 this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
 and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue
whitmore speak captain shall i stab the forlorn swain
captain first let my words stab him as he hath me
suffolk base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou
captain convey him hence and on our longboat's side
 strike off his head
suffolk thou darest not for thy own
captain yes pole
suffolk pole
captain pool sir pool lord
 ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
 troubles the silver spring where england drinks
 now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth
 for swallowing the treasure of the realm
 thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground
 and thou that smiledst at good duke humphrey's death
 against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain
 who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
 and wedded be thou to the hags of hell
 for daring to affy a mighty lord
 unto the daughter of a worthless king
 having neither subject wealth nor diadem
 by devilish policy art thou grown great
 and like ambitious sylla overgorged
 with gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart
 by thee anjou and maine were sold to france
 the false revolting normans thorough thee
 disdain to call us lord and picardy
 hath slain their governors surprised our forts
 and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
 the princely warwick and the nevils all
 whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
 as hating thee are rising up in arms
 and now the house of york thrust from the crown
 by shameful murder of a guiltless king
 and lofty proud encroaching tyranny
 burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
 advance our halffaced sun striving to shine
 under the which is writ invitis nubibus'
 the commons here in kent are up in arms
 and to conclude reproach and beggary
 is crept into the palace of our king
 and all by thee away convey him hence
suffolk o that i were a god to shoot forth thunder
 upon these paltry servile abject drudges
 small things make base men proud this villain here
 being captain of a pinnace threatens more
 than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate
 drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives
 it is impossible that i should die
 by such a lowly vassal as thyself
 thy words move rage and not remorse in me
 i go of message from the queen to france
 i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel
captain walter
whitmore come suffolk i must waft thee to thy death
suffolk gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear
whitmore thou shalt have cause to fear before i leave thee
 what are ye daunted now now will ye stoop
first gentleman my gracious lord entreat him speak him fair
suffolk suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough
 used to command untaught to plead for favour
 far be it we should honour such as these
 with humble suit no rather let my head
 stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
 save to the god of heaven and to my king
 and sooner dance upon a bloody pole
 than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom
 true nobility is exempt from fear
 more can i bear than you dare execute
captain hale him away and let him talk no more
suffolk come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
 that this my death may never be forgot
 great men oft die by vile bezonians
 a roman sworder and banditto slave
 murder'd sweet tully brutus bastard hand
 stabb'd julius caesar savage islanders
 pompey the great and suffolk dies by pirates
 exeunt whitmore and others with suffolk
captain and as for these whose ransom we have set
 it is our pleasure one of them depart
 therefore come you with us and let him go
 exeunt all but the first gentleman
 reenter whitmore with suffolk's body
whitmore there let his head and lifeless body lie
 until the queen his mistress bury it
 exit
first gentleman o barbarous and bloody spectacle
 his body will i bear unto the king
 if he revenge it not yet will his friends
 so will the queen that living held him dear
 exit with the body

 ear can endure to hear thou hast appointed

 hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a
 thousand years i could stay no longer wherefore
 on a brick wall have i climbed into this garden to
 see if i can eat grass or pick a sallet another
 while which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach
 this hot weather and i think this word sallet'
 was born to do me good for many a time but for a
 sallet my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
 bill and many a time when i have been dry and
 bravely marching it hath served me instead of a
 quart pot to drink in and now the word sallet'

 thy hand is but a finger to my fist
 thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon
 my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
 and if mine arm be heaved in the air
 thy grave is digg'd already in the earth

 should raise so great a power without his leave
 or dare to bring thy force so near the court
york aside scarce can i speak my choler is so great
 o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint

 but i must make fair weather yet a while
 till henry be more weak and i more strong
 buckingham i prithee pardon me
 that i have given no answer all this while
 my mind was troubled with deep melancholy
 the cause why i have brought this army hither
 is to remove proud somerset from the king
 seditious to his grace and to the state

 false king why hast thou broken faith with me
 knowing how hardly i can brook abuse
 king did i call thee no thou art not king
 not fit to govern and rule multitudes
 which darest not no nor canst not rule a traitor
 that head of thine doth not become a crown
 thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff
 and not to grace an awful princely sceptre
 that gold must round engirt these brows of mine
 whose smile and frown like to achilles spear
 is able with the change to kill and cure
 here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
 and with the same to act controlling laws
 give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more
 o'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler

king henry vi ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour
 makes him oppose himself against his king
clifford he is a traitor let him to the tower
 and chop away that factious pate of his
queen margaret he is arrested but will not obey
 his sons he says shall give their words for him
york will you not sons
edward ay noble father if our words will serve
richard and if words will not then our weapons shall
clifford why what a brood of traitors have we here
york look in a glass and call thy image so
 i am thy king and thou a falseheart traitor

 that with the very shaking of their chains
 they may astonish these felllurking curs
 bid salisbury and warwick come to me
 enter the warwick and salisbury
clifford are these thy bears we'll bait thy bears to death
 and manacle the bearward in their chains

 run back and bite because he was withheld
 who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw
 hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried
 and such a piece of service will you do
 if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick
clifford hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump
 as crooked in thy manners as thy shape
york nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon
clifford take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves
king henry vi why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
 old salisbury shame to thy silver hair
 thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son
 what wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian
 and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
 o where is faith o where is loyalty
 if it be banish'd from the frosty head
 where shall it find a harbour in the earth
 wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
 and shame thine honourable age with blood
 why art thou old and want'st experience
 or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
 for shame in duty bend thy knee to me
 that bows unto the grave with mickle age
salisbury my lord i have consider'd with myself
 the title of this most renowned duke
 and in my conscience do repute his grace
 the rightful heir to england's royal seat
king henry vi hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me
salisbury i have
king henry vi canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
salisbury it is great sin to swear unto a sin
 but greater sin to keep a sinful oath
 who can be bound by any solemn vow
 to do a murderous deed to rob a man
 to force a spotless virgin's chastity
 to reave the orphan of his patrimony
 to wring the widow from her custom'd right
 and have no other reason for this wrong
 but that he was bound by a solemn oath
queen margaret a subtle traitor needs no sophister
king henry vi call buckingham and bid him arm himself
york call buckingham and all the friends thou hast
 i am resolved for death or dignity
clifford the first i warrant thee if dreams prove true
warwick you were best to go to bed and dream again
 to keep thee from the tempest of the field
clifford i am resolved to bear a greater storm
 than any thou canst conjure up today
 and that i'll write upon thy burgonet
 might i but know thee by thy household badge
warwick now by my father's badge old nevil's crest
 the rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff
 this day i'll wear aloft my burgonet

 and tread it under foot with all contempt
 despite the bearward that protects the bear

 hath no selflove nor he that loves himself
 hath not essentially but by circumstance
 the name of valour
 seeing his dead father
 o let the vile world end
 and the premised flames of the last day
 knit earth and heaven together
 now let the general trumpet blow his blast
 particularities and petty sounds
 to cease wast thou ordain'd dear father
 to lose thy youth in peace and to achieve
 the silver livery of advised age
 and in thy reverence and thy chairdays thus
 to die in ruffian battle even at this sight
 my heart is turn'd to stone and while tis mine
 it shall be stony york not our old men spares
 no more will i their babes tears virginal
 shall be to me even as the dew to fire
 and beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
 shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax
 henceforth i will not have to do with pity
 meet i an infant of the house of york
 into as many gobbets will i cut it
 as wild medea young absyrtus did
 in cruelty will i seek out my fame
 come thou new ruin of old clifford's house

 so bear i thee upon my manly shoulders
 but then aeneas bare a living load

 whose warlike ears could never brook retreat
 cheer'd up the drooping army and himself
 lord clifford and lord stafford all abreast

norfolk such hope have all the line of john of gaunt
richard thus do i hope to shake king henry's head
warwick and so do i victorious prince of york

 which now the house of lancaster usurps
 i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
 this is the palace of the fearful king
 and this the regal seat possess it york
 for this is thine and not king henry's heirs'
york assist me then sweet warwick and i will
 for hither we have broken in by force
norfolk we'll all assist you he that flies shall die
york thanks gentle norfolk stay by me my lords
 and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night
 they go up
warwick and when the king comes offer no violence
 unless he seek to thrust you out perforce
york the queen this day here holds her parliament
 but little thinks we shall be of her council
 by words or blows here let us win our right
richard arm'd as we are let's stay within this house
warwick the bloody parliament shall this be call'd
 unless plantagenet duke of york be king
 and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice
 hath made us bywords to our enemies
york then leave me not my lords be resolute
 i mean to take possession of my right

 on him his sons his favourites and his friends
northumberland if i be not heavens be revenged on me
clifford the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel
westmoreland what shall we suffer this let's pluck him down
 my heart for anger burns i cannot brook it
king henry vi be patient gentle earl of westmoreland
clifford patience is for poltroons such as he
 he durst not sit there had your father lived
 my gracious lord here in the parliament
 let us assail the family of york
northumberland well hast thou spoken cousin be it so
king henry vi ah know you not the city favours them
 and they have troops of soldiers at their beck
exeter but when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly
king henry vi far be the thought of this from henry's heart
 to make a shambles of the parliamenthouse
 cousin of exeter frowns words and threats
 shall be the war that henry means to use
 thou factious duke of york descend my throne
 and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet
 i am thy sovereign
york i am thine
exeter for shame come down he made thee duke of york
york twas my inheritance as the earldom was
exeter thy father was a traitor to the crown
warwick exeter thou art a traitor to the crown
 in following this usurping henry
clifford whom should he follow but his natural king
warwick true clifford and that's richard duke of york
king henry vi and shall i stand and thou sit in my throne
york it must and shall be so content thyself
warwick be duke of lancaster let him be king
westmoreland he is both king and duke of lancaster
 and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain
warwick and warwick shall disprove it you forget
 that we are those which chased you from the field
 and slew your fathers and with colours spread

northumberland yes warwick i remember it to my grief
 and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it
westmoreland plantagenet of thee and these thy sons
 thy kinsman and thy friends i'll have more lives
 than drops of blood were in my father's veins
clifford urge it no more lest that instead of words
 i send thee warwick such a messenger
 as shall revenge his death before i stir
warwick poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats
york will you we show our title to the crown
 if not our swords shall plead it in the field
king henry vi what title hast thou traitor to the crown
 thy father was as thou art duke of york
 thy grandfather roger mortimer earl of march
 i am the son of henry the fifth
 who made the dauphin and the french to stoop
 and seized upon their towns and provinces
warwick talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all
king henry vi the lord protector lost it and not i
 when i was crown'd i was but nine months old
richard you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose
 father tear the crown from the usurper's head

 and made him to resign his crown perforce
warwick suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd
 think you twere prejudicial to his crown
exeter no for he could not so resign his crown
 but that the next heir should succeed and reign
king henry vi art thou against us duke of exeter
exeter his is the right and therefore pardon me
york why whisper you my lords and answer not
exeter my conscience tells me he is lawful king
king henry vi aside all will revolt from me and turn to him
northumberland plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st
 think not that henry shall be so deposed
warwick deposed he shall be in despite of all
northumberland thou art deceived tis not thy southern power
 of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent
 which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
 can set the duke up in despite of me
clifford king henry be thy title right or wrong
 lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence
 may that ground gape and swallow me alive
 where i shall kneel to him that slew my father
king henry vi o clifford how thy words revive my heart
york henry of lancaster resign thy crown
 what mutter you or what conspire you lords
warwick do right unto this princely duke of york
 or i will fill the house with armed men
 and over the chair of state where now he sits
 write up his title with usurping blood
 he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
 themselves
king henry vi my lord of warwick hear me but one word
 let me for this my lifetime reign as king
york confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
 and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest

queen margaret nay go not from me i will follow thee
king henry vi be patient gentle queen and i will stay
queen margaret who can be patient in such extremes
 ah wretched man would i had died a maid
 and never seen thee never borne thee son
 seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
 hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus
 hadst thou but loved him half so well as i
 or felt that pain which i did for him once
 or nourish'd him as i did with my blood
 thou wouldst have left thy dearest heartblood there
 rather than have that savage duke thine heir
 and disinherited thine only son
prince edward father you cannot disinherit me
 if you be king why should not i succeed
king henry vi pardon me margaret pardon me sweet son
 the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me
queen margaret enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced
 i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch
 thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
 and given unto the house of york such head
 as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
 to entail him and his heirs unto the crown
 what is it but to make thy sepulchre
 and creep into it far before thy time
 warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais
 stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas
 the duke is made protector of the realm
 and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds
 the trembling lamb environed with wolves
 had i been there which am a silly woman
 the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
 before i would have granted to that act
 but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour
 and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself
 both from thy table henry and thy bed
 until that act of parliament be repeal'd
 whereby my son is disinherited
 the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
 will follow mine if once they see them spread
 and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
 and utter ruin of the house of york
 thus do i leave thee come son let's away
 our army is ready come we'll after them
king henry vi stay gentle margaret and hear me speak
queen margaret thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone
king henry vi gentle son edward thou wilt stay with me

 hath made her break out into terms of rage
 revenged may she be on that hateful duke
 whose haughty spirit winged with desire
 will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
 tire on the flesh of me and of my son
 the loss of those three lords torments my heart
 i'll write unto them and entreat them fair
 come cousin you shall be the messenger
exeter and i i hope shall reconcile them all

 what is your quarrel how began it first
edward no quarrel but a slight contention
york about what
richard about that which concerns your grace and us
 the crown of england father which is yours
york mine boy not till king henry be dead
richard your right depends not on his life or death
edward now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
 by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe
 it will outrun you father in the end
york i took an oath that he should quietly reign
edward but for a kingdom any oath may be broken
 i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
richard no god forbid your grace should be forsworn
york i shall be if i claim by open war
richard i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak
york thou canst not son it is impossible
richard an oath is of no moment being not took
 before a true and lawful magistrate
 that hath authority over him that swears
 henry had none but did usurp the place
 then seeing twas he that made you to depose
 your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
 therefore to arms and father do but think
 how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
 within whose circuit is elysium
 and all that poets feign of bliss and joy
 why do we finger thus i cannot rest
 until the white rose that i wear be dyed
 even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart
york richard enough i will be king or die
 brother thou shalt to london presently
 and whet on warwick to this enterprise
 thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk

 you edward shall unto my lord cobham
 with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise

 edward and richard you shall stay with me
 my brother montague shall post to london

 and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
 ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword
 and not with such a cruel threatening look
 sweet clifford hear me speak before i die
 i am too mean a subject for thy wrath
 be thou revenged on men and let me live
clifford in vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood
 hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter
rutland then let my father's blood open it again
 he is a man and clifford cope with him
clifford had thy brethren here their lives and thine
 were not revenge sufficient for me
 no if i digg'd up thy forefathers graves
 and hung their rotten coffins up in chains
 it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
 the sight of any of the house of york
 is as a fury to torment my soul
 and till i root out their accursed line
 and leave not one alive i live in hell
 therefore
 lifting his hand
rutland o let me pray before i take my death
 to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me
clifford such pity as my rapier's point affords
rutland i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me
clifford thy father hath
rutland but twas ere i was born
 thou hast one son for his sake pity me
 lest in revenge thereof sith god is just
 he be as miserably slain as i
 ah let me live in prison all my days
 and when i give occasion of offence
 then let me die for now thou hast no cause
clifford no cause
 thy father slew my father therefore die
 stabs him
rutland di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae

 my uncles both are slain in rescuing me
 and all my followers to the eager foe
 turn back and fly like ships before the wind
 or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves
 my sons god knows what hath bechanced them
 but this i know they have demean'd themselves
 like men born to renown by life or death
 three times did richard make a lane to me
 and thrice cried courage father fight it out'
 and full as oft came edward to my side
 with purple falchion painted to the hilt
 in blood of those that had encounter'd him
 and when the hardiest warriors did retire
 richard cried charge and give no foot of ground'
 and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb
 a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre'
 with this we charged again but out alas
 we bodged again as i have seen a swan
 with bootless labour swim against the tide
 and spend her strength with overmatching waves
 a short alarum within

 come bloody clifford rough northumberland
 i dare your quenchless fury to more rage
 i am your butt and i abide your shot
northumberland yield to our mercy proud plantagenet
clifford ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
 with downright payment show'd unto my father
 now phaethon hath tumbled from his car
 and made an evening at the noontide prick
york my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
 a bird that will revenge upon you all
 and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven
 scorning whate'er you can afflict me with
 why come you not what multitudes and fear
clifford so cowards fight when they can fly no further
 so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons
 so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
 breathe out invectives gainst the officers
york o clifford but bethink thee once again
 and in thy thought o'errun my former time
 and if though canst for blushing view this face
 and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
 whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
clifford i will not bandy with thee word for word
 but buckle with thee blows twice two for one
queen margaret hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes
 i would prolong awhile the traitor's life
 wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland
northumberland hold clifford do not honour him so much
 to prick thy finger though to wound his heart
 what valour were it when a cur doth grin
 for one to thrust his hand between his teeth
 when he might spurn him with his foot away
 it is war's prize to take all vantages
 and ten to one is no impeach of valour
 they lay hands on york who struggles
clifford ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
northumberland so doth the cony struggle in the net
york so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty
 so true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd
northumberland what would your grace have done unto him now
queen margaret brave warriors clifford and northumberland
 come make him stand upon this molehill here
 that raught at mountains with outstretched arms
 yet parted but the shadow with his hand
 what was it you that would be england's king
 was't you that revell'd in our parliament
 and made a preachment of your high descent
 where are your mess of sons to back you now
 the wanton edward and the lusty george
 and where's that valiant crookback prodigy
 dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
 was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
 or with the rest where is your darling rutland
 look york i stain'd this napkin with the blood
 that valiant clifford with his rapier's point
 made issue from the bosom of the boy
 and if thine eyes can water for his death
 i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
 alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly
 i should lament thy miserable state
 i prithee grieve to make me merry york
 what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
 that not a tear can fall for rutland's death
 why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad
 and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus
 stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance
 thou wouldst be fee'd i see to make me sport
 york cannot speak unless he wear a crown
 a crown for york and lords bow low to him
 hold you his hands whilst i do set it on
 putting a paper crown on his head
 ay marry sir now looks he like a king
 ay this is he that took king henry's chair
 and this is he was his adopted heir
 but how is it that great plantagenet
 is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath
 as i bethink me you should not be king
 till our king henry had shook hands with death
 and will you pale your head in henry's glory
 and rob his temples of the diadem
 now in his life against your holy oath
 o tis a fault too too unpardonable
 off with the crown and with the crown his head
 and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
clifford that is my office for my father's sake
queen margaret nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes
york shewolf of france but worse than wolves of france
 whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth
 how illbeseeming is it in thy sex
 to triumph like an amazonian trull
 upon their woes whom fortune captivates
 but that thy face is vizardlike unchanging
 made impudent with use of evil deeds
 i would assay proud queen to make thee blush
 to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived
 were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
 thy father bears the type of king of naples
 of both the sicils and jerusalem
 yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman
 hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
 it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
 unless the adage must be verified
 that beggars mounted run their horse to death
 tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
 but god he knows thy share thereof is small
 tis virtue that doth make them most admired
 the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at
 tis government that makes them seem divine
 the want thereof makes thee abominable
 thou art as opposite to every good
 as the antipodes are unto us
 or as the south to the septentrion
 o tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide
 how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child
 to bid the father wipe his eyes withal
 and yet be seen to bear a woman's face
 women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
 thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
 bids't thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish
 wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will
 for raging wind blows up incessant showers
 and when the rage allays the rain begins
 these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies
 and every drop cries vengeance for his death
 gainst thee fell clifford and thee false
 frenchwoman
northumberland beshrew me but his passion moves me so
 that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears
york that face of his the hungry cannibals
 would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood
 but you are more inhuman more inexorable
 o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania
 see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears
 this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy
 and i with tears do wash the blood away
 keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
 and if thou tell'st the heavy story right
 upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
 yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears
 and say alas it was a piteous deed'
 there take the crown and with the crown my curse
 and in thy need such comfort come to thee
 as now i reap at thy too cruel hand
 hardhearted clifford take me from the world
 my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
northumberland had he been slaughterman to all my kin
 i should not for my life but weep with him
 to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
queen margaret what weepingripe my lord northumberland
 think but upon the wrong he did us all
 and that will quickly dry thy melting tears
clifford here's for my oath here's for my father's death
 stabbing him
queen margaret and here's to right our gentlehearted king
 stabbing him
york open thy gate of mercy gracious god
 my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee
 dies
queen margaret off with his head and set it on york gates
 so york may overlook the town of york

 3 king henry vi
act ii
scene i a plain near mortimer's cross in herefordshire
 a march enter edward richard and their power
edward i wonder how our princely father scaped
 or whether he be scaped away or no
 from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit
 had he been ta'en we should have heard the news
 had he been slain we should have heard the news
 or had he scaped methinks we should have heard
 the happy tidings of his good escape
 how fares my brother why is he so sad
richard i cannot joy until i be resolved
 where our right valiant father is become
 i saw him in the battle range about
 and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth
 methought he bore him in the thickest troop
 as doth a lion in a herd of neat
 or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs
 who having pinch'd a few and made them cry
 the rest stand all aloof and bark at him
 so fared our father with his enemies
 so fled his enemies my warlike father
 methinks tis prize enough to be his son
 see how the morning opes her golden gates
 and takes her farewell of the glorious sun
 how well resembles it the prime of youth
 trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love
edward dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns
richard three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
 not separated with the racking clouds
 but sever'd in a pale clearshining sky
 see see they join embrace and seem to kiss
 as if they vow'd some league inviolable
 now are they but one lamp one light one sun
 in this the heaven figures some event
edward tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
 i think it cites us brother to the field
 that we the sons of brave plantagenet
 each one already blazing by our meeds
 should notwithstanding join our lights together
 and overshine the earth as this the world
 whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear
 upon my target three fairshining suns
richard nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it
 you love the breeder better than the male
 enter a messenger
 but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
 some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
messenger ah one that was a woful lookeron
 when as the noble duke of york was slain
 your princely father and my loving lord
edward o speak no more for i have heard too much
richard say how he died for i will hear it all
messenger environed he was with many foes
 and stood against them as the hope of troy
 against the greeks that would have enter'd troy
 but hercules himself must yield to odds
 and many strokes though with a little axe
 hew down and fell the hardesttimber'd oak
 by many hands your father was subdued
 but only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
 of unrelenting clifford and the queen
 who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite
 laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept
 the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
 a napkin steeped in the harmless blood
 of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain
 and after many scorns many foul taunts
 they took his head and on the gates of york
 they set the same and there it doth remain
 the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd
edward sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon
 now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
 o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain
 the flower of europe for his chivalry
 and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him
 for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee
 now my soul's palace is become a prison
 ah would she break from hence that this my body
 might in the ground be closed up in rest
 for never henceforth shall i joy again
 never o never shall i see more joy
richard i cannot weep for all my body's moisture
 scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart
 nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen
 for selfsame wind that i should speak withal
 is kindling coals that fires all my breast
 and burns me up with flames that tears would quench
 to weep is to make less the depth of grief
 tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
 richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death
 or die renowned by attempting it
edward his name that valiant duke hath left with thee
 his dukedom and his chair with me is left
richard nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird
 show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun
 for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
 either that is thine or else thou wert not his
 march enter warwick montague and their army
warwick how now fair lords what fare what news abroad
richard great lord of warwick if we should recount
 our baleful news and at each word's deliverance
 stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
 the words would add more anguish than the wounds
 o valiant lord the duke of york is slain
edward o warwick warwick that plantagenet
 which held three dearly as his soul's redemption
 is by the stern lord clifford done to death
warwick ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears
 and now to add more measure to your woes
 i come to tell you things sith then befall'n
 after the bloody fray at wakefield fought
 where your brave father breathed his latest gasp
 tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
 were brought me of your loss and his depart
 i then in london keeper of the king
 muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends
 and very well appointed as i thought
 march'd toward saint alban's to intercept the queen
 bearing the king in my behalf along
 for by my scouts i was advertised
 that she was coming with a full intent
 to dash our late decree in parliament
 touching king henry's oath and your succession
 short tale to make we at saint alban's met
 our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought
 but whether twas the coldness of the king
 who look'd full gently on his warlike queen
 that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen
 or whether twas report of her success
 or more than common fear of clifford's rigour
 who thunders to his captives blood and death
 i cannot judge but to conclude with truth
 their weapons like to lightning came and went
 our soldiers like the nightowl's lazy flight
 or like an idle thresher with a flail
 fell gently down as if they struck their friends
 i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause
 with promise of high pay and great rewards
 but all in vain they had no heart to fight
 and we in them no hope to win the day
 so that we fled the king unto the queen
 lord george your brother norfolk and myself
 in haste posthaste are come to join with you
 for in the marches here we heard you were
 making another head to fight again
edward where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick
 and when came george from burgundy to england
warwick some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers
 and for your brother he was lately sent
 from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy
 with aid of soldiers to this needful war
richard twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled
 oft have i heard his praises in pursuit
 but ne'er till now his scandal of retire
warwick nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear
 for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
 can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head
 and wring the awful sceptre from his fist
 were he as famous and as bold in war
 as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer
richard i know it well lord warwick blame me not
 tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak
 but in this troublous time what's to be done
 shall we go throw away our coats of steel
 and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
 numbering our avemaries with our beads
 or shall we on the helmets of our foes
 tell our devotion with revengeful arms
 if for the last say ay and to it lords
warwick why therefore warwick came to seek you out
 and therefore comes my brother montague
 attend me lords the proud insulting queen
 with clifford and the haught northumberland
 and of their feather many more proud birds
 have wrought the easymelting king like wax
 he swore consent to your succession
 his oath enrolled in the parliament
 and now to london all the crew are gone
 to frustrate both his oath and what beside
 may make against the house of lancaster
 their power i think is thirty thousand strong
 now if the help of norfolk and myself
 with all the friends that thou brave earl of march
 amongst the loving welshmen canst procure
 will but amount to five and twenty thousand
 why via to london will we march amain
 and once again bestride our foaming steeds
 and once again cry charge upon our foes'
 but never once again turn back and fly
richard ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak
 ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day
 that cries retire if warwick bid him stay
edward lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean
 and when thou fail'stas god forbid the hour
 must edward fall which peril heaven forfend
warwick no longer earl of march but duke of york
 the next degree is england's royal throne
 for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'd
 in every borough as we pass along
 and he that throws not up his cap for joy
 shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
 king edward valiant richard montague
 stay we no longer dreaming of renown
 but sound the trumpets and about our task
richard then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
 as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
 i come to pierce it or to give thee mine
edward then strike up drums god and saint george for us
 enter a messenger
warwick how now what news
messenger the duke of norfolk sends you word by me
 the queen is coming with a puissant host
 and craves your company for speedy counsel
warwick why then it sorts brave warriors let's away

 3 king henry vi
act ii
scene ii before york
 flourish enter king henry vi queen margaret
 prince edward clifford and northumberland with
 drum and trumpets
queen margaret welcome my lord to this brave town of york
 yonder's the head of that archenemy
 that sought to be encompass'd with your crown
 doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
king henry vi ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck
 to see this sight it irks my very soul
 withhold revenge dear god tis not my fault
 nor wittingly have i infringed my vow
clifford my gracious liege this too much lenity
 and harmful pity must be laid aside
 to whom do lions cast their gentle looks
 not to the beast that would usurp their den
 whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
 not his that spoils her young before her face
 who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting
 not he that sets his foot upon her back
 the smallest worm will turn being trodden on
 and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
 ambitious york doth level at thy crown
 thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
 he but a duke would have his son a king
 and raise his issue like a loving sire
 thou being a king blest with a goodly son
 didst yield consent to disinherit him
 which argued thee a most unloving father
 unreasonable creatures feed their young
 and though man's face be fearful to their eyes
 yet in protection of their tender ones
 who hath not seen them even with those wings
 which sometime they have used with fearful flight
 make war with him that climb'd unto their nest
 offer their own lives in their young's defence
 for shame my liege make them your precedent
 were it not pity that this goodly boy
 should lose his birthright by his father's fault
 and long hereafter say unto his child
 what my greatgrandfather and his grandsire got
 my careless father fondly gave away'
 ah what a shame were this look on the boy
 and let his manly face which promiseth
 successful fortune steel thy melting heart
 to hold thine own and leave thine own with him
king henry vi full well hath clifford play'd the orator
 inferring arguments of mighty force
 but clifford tell me didst thou never hear
 that things illgot had ever bad success
 and happy always was it for that son
 whose father for his hoarding went to hell
 i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
 and would my father had left me no more
 for all the rest is held at such a rate
 as brings a thousandfold more care to keep
 than in possession and jot of pleasure
 ah cousin york would thy best friends did know
 how it doth grieve me that thy head is here
queen margaret my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
 and this soft courage makes your followers faint
 you promised knighthood to our forward son
 unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
 edward kneel down
king henry vi edward plantagenet arise a knight
 and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
prince my gracious father by your kingly leave
 i'll draw it as apparent to the crown
 and in that quarrel use it to the death
clifford why that is spoken like a toward prince
 enter a messenger
messenger royal commanders be in readiness
 for with a band of thirty thousand men
 comes warwick backing of the duke of york
 and in the towns as they do march along
 proclaims him king and many fly to him
 darraign your battle for they are at hand
clifford i would your highness would depart the field
 the queen hath best success when you are absent
queen margaret ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
king henry vi why that's my fortune too therefore i'll stay
northumberland be it with resolution then to fight
prince edward my royal father cheer these noble lords
 and hearten those that fight in your defence
 unsheathe your sword good father cry saint george'
 march enter edward george richard warwick
 norfolk montague and soldiers
edward now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace
 and set thy diadem upon my head
 or bide the mortal fortune of the field
queen margaret go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
 becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
 before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
edward i am his king and he should bow his knee
 i was adopted heir by his consent
 since when his oath is broke for as i hear
 you that are king though he do wear the crown
 have caused him by new act of parliament
 to blot out me and put his own son in
clifford and reason too
 who should succeed the father but the son
richard are you there butcher o i cannot speak
clifford ay crookback here i stand to answer thee
 or any he the proudest of thy sort
richard twas you that kill'd young rutland was it not
clifford ay and old york and yet not satisfied
richard for god's sake lords give signal to the fight
warwick what say'st thou henry wilt thou yield the crown
queen margaret why how now longtongued warwick dare you speak
 when you and i met at saint alban's last
 your legs did better service than your hands
warwick then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine
clifford you said so much before and yet you fled
warwick twas not your valour clifford drove me thence
northumberland no nor your manhood that durst make you stay
richard northumberland i hold thee reverently
 break off the parley for scarce i can refrain
 the execution of my bigswoln heart
 upon that clifford that cruel childkiller
clifford i slew thy father call'st thou him a child
richard ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
 as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland
 but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed
king henry vi have done with words my lords and hear me speak
queen margaret defy them then or else hold close thy lips
king henry vi i prithee give no limits to my tongue
 i am a king and privileged to speak
clifford my liege the wound that bred this meeting here
 cannot be cured by words therefore be still
richard then executioner unsheathe thy sword
 by him that made us all i am resolved
 that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue
edward say henry shall i have my right or no
 a thousand men have broke their fasts today
 that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown
warwick if thou deny their blood upon thy head
 for york in justice puts his armour on
prince edward if that be right which warwick says is right
 there is no wrong but every thing is right
richard whoever got thee there thy mother stands
 for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue
queen margaret but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
 but like a foul misshapen stigmatic
 mark'd by the destinies to be avoided
 as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings
richard iron of naples hid with english gilt
 whose father bears the title of a king
 as if a channel should be call'd the sea
 shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
 to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart
edward a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
 to make this shameless callet know herself
 helen of greece was fairer far than thou
 although thy husband may be menelaus
 and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wrong'd
 by that false woman as this king by thee
 his father revell'd in the heart of france
 and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop
 and had he match'd according to his state
 he might have kept that glory to this day
 but when he took a beggar to his bed
 and graced thy poor sire with his bridalday
 even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him
 that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france
 and heap'd sedition on his crown at home
 for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride
 hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
 and we in pity of the gentle king
 had slipp'd our claim until another age
george but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
 and that thy summer bred us no increase
 we set the axe to thy usurping root
 and though the edge hath something hit ourselves
 yet know thou since we have begun to strike
 we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down
 or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods
edward and in this resolution i defy thee
 not willing any longer conference
 since thou deniest the gentle king to speak
 sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
 and either victory or else a grave
queen margaret stay edward
edward no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay
 these words will cost ten thousand lives this day

 for strokes received and many blows repaid

edward smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
 for this world frowns and edward's sun is clouded

george our hap is loss our hope but sad despair
 our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
 what counsel give you whither shall we fly
edward bootless is flight they follow us with wings
 and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
 enter richard
richard ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
 thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
 broach'd with the steely point of clifford's lance
 and in the very pangs of death he cried
 like to a dismal clangour heard from far
 warwick revenge brother revenge my death'
 so underneath the belly of their steeds
 that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood
 the noble gentleman gave up the ghost
warwick then let the earth be drunken with our blood
 i'll kill my horse because i will not fly
 why stand we like softhearted women here
 wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
 and look upon as if the tragedy
 were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors
 here on my knee i vow to god above
 i'll never pause again never stand still
 till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
 or fortune given me measure of revenge
edward o warwick i do bend my knee with thine
 and in this vow do chain my soul to thine
 and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face
 i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee
 thou setter up and plucker down of kings
 beseeching thee if with they will it stands
 that to my foes this body must be prey
 yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
 and give sweet passage to my sinful soul
 now lords take leave until we meet again
 where'er it be in heaven or in earth
richard brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick
 let me embrace thee in my weary arms
 i that did never weep now melt with woe
 that winter should cut off our springtime so
warwick away away once more sweet lords farewell
george yet let us all together to our troops
 and give them leave to fly that will not stay
 and call them pillars that will stand to us
 and if we thrive promise them such rewards
 as victors wear at the olympian games
 this may plant courage in their quailing breasts
 for yet is hope of life and victory
 forslow no longer make we hence amain

 alarum enter king henry vi alone
king henry vi this battle fares like to the morning's war
 when dying clouds contend with growing light
 what time the shepherd blowing of his nails
 can neither call it perfect day nor night
 now sways it this way like a mighty sea
 forced by the tide to combat with the wind
 now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
 forced to retire by fury of the wind
 sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
 now one the better then another best
 both tugging to be victors breast to breast
 yet neither conqueror nor conquered
 so is the equal of this fell war
 here on this molehill will i sit me down
 to whom god will there be the victory
 for margaret my queen and clifford too
 have chid me from the battle swearing both
 they prosper best of all when i am thence
 would i were dead if god's good will were so
 for what is in this world but grief and woe
 o god methinks it were a happy life
 to be no better than a homely swain
 to sit upon a hill as i do now
 to carve out dials quaintly point by point
 thereby to see the minutes how they run
 how many make the hour full complete
 how many hours bring about the day
 how many days will finish up the year
 how many years a mortal man may live
 when this is known then to divide the times
 so many hours must i tend my flock
 so many hours must i take my rest
 so many hours must i contemplate
 so many hours must i sport myself
 so many days my ewes have been with young
 so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
 so many years ere i shall shear the fleece
 so minutes hours days months and years
 pass'd over to the end they were created
 would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
 ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
 gives not the hawthornbush a sweeter shade
 to shepherds looking on their silly sheep
 than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
 to kings that fear their subjects treachery
 o yes it doth a thousandfold it doth
 and to conclude the shepherd's homely curds
 his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
 his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade
 all which secure and sweetly he enjoys
 is far beyond a prince's delicates
 his viands sparkling in a golden cup
 his body couched in a curious bed
 when care mistrust and treason waits on him

 dragging in the dead body
son ill blows the wind that profits nobody

 to some man else as this dead man doth me
 who's this o god it is my father's face
 whom in this conflict i unwares have kill'd
 o heavy times begetting such events
 from london by the king was i press'd forth
 my father being the earl of warwick's man
 came on the part of york press'd by his master
 and i who at his hands received my life him
 have by my hands of life bereaved him
 pardon me god i knew not what i did
 and pardon father for i knew not thee
 my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
 and no more words till they have flow'd their fill
king henry vi o piteous spectacle o bloody times
 whiles lions war and battle for their dens
 poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
 weep wretched man i'll aid thee tear for tear
 and let our hearts and eyes like civil war
 be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief
 enter a father that has killed his son bringing in the body
father thou that so stoutly hast resisted me
 give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
 for i have bought it with an hundred blows
 but let me see is this our foeman's face
 ah no no no it is mine only son
 ah boy if any life be left in thee
 throw up thine eye see see what showers arise
 blown with the windy tempest of my heart
 upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart
 o pity god this miserable age
 what stratagems how fell how butcherly
 erroneous mutinous and unnatural
 this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
 o boy thy father gave thee life too soon
 and hath bereft thee of thy life too late
king henry vi woe above woe grief more than common grief
 o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
 o pity pity gentle heaven pity
 the red rose and the white are on his face
 the fatal colours of our striving houses
 the one his purple blood right well resembles
 the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
 wither one rose and let the other flourish
 if you contend a thousand lives must wither
son how will my mother for a father's death
 take on with me and ne'er be satisfied
father how will my wife for slaughter of my son
 shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied
king henry vi how will the country for these woful chances
 misthink the king and not be satisfied
son was ever son so rued a father's death
father was ever father so bemoan'd his son
king henry vi was ever king so grieved for subjects woe
 much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
son i'll bear thee hence where i may weep my fill
 exit with the body
father these arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet
 my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
 for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go
 my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
 and so obsequious will thy father be
 even for the loss of thee having no more
 as priam was for all his valiant sons
 i'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will

 and who shines now but henry's enemies
 o phoebus hadst thou never given consent
 that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds
 thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth
 and henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do
 or as thy father and his father did
 giving no ground unto the house of york
 they never then had sprung like summer flies
 i and ten thousand in this luckless realm
 had left no mourning widows for our death
 and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
 for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
 and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
 bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
 no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
 the foe is merciless and will not pity
 for at their hands i have deserved no pity
 the air hath got into my deadly wounds
 and much effuse of blood doth make me faint
 come york and richard warwick and the rest
 i stabb'd your fathers bosoms split my breast
 he faints
 alarum and retreat enter edward george richard
 montague warwick and soldiers
edward now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause
 and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
 some troops pursue the bloodyminded queen
 that led calm henry though he were a king
 as doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust
 command an argosy to stem the waves
 but think you lords that clifford fled with them
warwick no tis impossible he should escape
 for though before his face i speak the words
 your brother richard mark'd him for the grave
 and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead
 clifford groans and dies
edward whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
richard a deadly groan like life and death's departing
edward see who it is and now the battle's ended
 if friend or foe let him be gently used
richard revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford
 who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
 in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth
 but set his murdering knife unto the root
 from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
 i mean our princely father duke of york
warwick from off the gates of york fetch down the head
 your father's head which clifford placed there
 instead whereof let this supply the room
 measure for measure must be answered
edward bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house
 that nothing sung but death to us and ours
 now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound
 and his illboding tongue no more shall speak
warwick i think his understanding is bereft
 speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
 dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life
 and he nor sees nor hears us what we say
richard o would he did and so perhaps he doth
 tis but his policy to counterfeit
 because he would avoid such bitter taunts
 which in the time of death he gave our father
george if so thou think'st vex him with eager words
richard clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
edward clifford repent in bootless penitence
warwick clifford devise excuses for thy faults
george while we devise fell tortures for thy faults
richard thou didst love york and i am son to york
edward thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee
george where's captain margaret to fence you now
warwick they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont
richard what not an oath nay then the world goes hard
 when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
 i know by that he's dead and by my soul
 if this right hand would buy two hour's life
 that i in all despite might rail at him
 this hand should chop it off and with the
 issuing blood
 stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
 york and young rutland could not satisfy
warwick ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head
 and rear it in the place your father's stands
 and now to london with triumphant march
 there to be crowned england's royal king
 from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france
 and ask the lady bona for thy queen
 so shalt thou sinew both these lands together
 and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread
 the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again
 for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
 yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
 first will i see the coronation
 and then to brittany i'll cross the sea
 to effect this marriage so it please my lord
edward even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be
 for in thy shoulder do i build my seat
 and never will i undertake the thing
 wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
 richard i will create thee duke of gloucester
 and george of clarence warwick as ourself
 shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
richard let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester
 for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous
warwick tut that's a foolish observation
 richard be duke of gloucester now to london
 to see these honours in possession

act iii
scene i a forest in the north of england
 enter two keepers with crossbows in their hands
first keeper under this thickgrown brake we'll shroud ourselves
 for through this laund anon the deer will come
 and in this covert will we make our stand
 culling the principal of all the deer
second keeper i'll stay above the hill so both may shoot
first keeper that cannot be the noise of thy crossbow
 will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
 here stand we both and aim we at the best
 and for the time shall not seem tedious
 i'll tell thee what befell me on a day
 in this selfplace where now we mean to stand
second keeper here comes a man let's stay till he be past
 enter king henry vi disguised with a prayerbook
king henry vi from scotland am i stol'n even of pure love
 to greet mine own land with my wishful sight
 no harry harry tis no land of thine
 thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee
 thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed
 no bending knee will call thee caesar now
 no humble suitors press to speak for right
 no not a man comes for redress of thee
 for how can i help them and not myself
first keeper ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee
 this is the quondam king let's seize upon him
king henry vi let me embrace thee sour adversity
 for wise men say it is the wisest course
second keeper why linger we let us lay hands upon him
first keeper forbear awhile we'll hear a little more
king henry vi my queen and son are gone to france for aid
 and as i hear the great commanding warwick
 is thither gone to crave the french king's sister
 to wife for edward if this news be true
 poor queen and son your labour is but lost
 for warwick is a subtle orator
 and lewis a prince soon won with moving words
 by this account then margaret may win him
 for she's a woman to be pitied much
 her sighs will make a battery in his breast
 her tears will pierce into a marble heart
 the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
 and nero will be tainted with remorse
 to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
 ay but she's come to beg warwick to give
 she on his left side craving aid for henry
 he on his right asking a wife for edward
 she weeps and says her henry is deposed
 he smiles and says his edward is install'd
 that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
 whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
 inferreth arguments of mighty strength
 and in conclusion wins the king from her
 with promise of his sister and what else
 to strengthen and support king edward's place
 o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul
 art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn
second keeper say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens
king henry vi more than i seem and less than i was born to
 a man at least for less i should not be
 and men may talk of kings and why not i
second keeper ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king
king henry vi why so i am in mind and that's enough
second keeper but if thou be a king where is thy crown
king henry vi my crown is in my heart not on my head
 not decked with diamonds and indian stones
 nor to be seen my crown is called content
 a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
second keeper well if you be a king crown'd with content
 your crown content and you must be contented
 to go along with us for as we think
 you are the king king edward hath deposed
 and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
 will apprehend you as his enemy
king henry vi but did you never swear and break an oath
second keeper no never such an oath nor will not now
king henry vi where did you dwell when i was king of england
second keeper here in this country where we now remain
king henry vi i was anointed king at nine months old
 my father and my grandfather were kings
 and you were sworn true subjects unto me
 and tell me then have you not broke your oaths
first keeper no
 for we were subjects but while you were king
king henry vi why am i dead do i not breathe a man
 ah simple men you know not what you swear
 look as i blow this feather from my face
 and as the air blows it to me again
 obeying with my wind when i do blow
 and yielding to another when it blows
 commanded always by the greater gust
 such is the lightness of you common men
 but do not break your oaths for of that sin
 my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
 go where you will the king shall be commanded
 and be you kings command and i'll obey
first keeper we are true subjects to the king king edward
king henry vi so would you be again to henry
 if he were seated as king edward is
first keeper we charge you in god's name and the king's
 to go with us unto the officers
king henry vi in god's name lead your king's name be obey'd
 and what god will that let your king perform
 and what he will i humbly yield unto

lady grey to do them good i would sustain some harm
king edward iv then get your husband's lands to do them good
lady grey therefore i came unto your majesty
king edward iv i'll tell you how these lands are to be got
lady grey so shall you bind me to your highness service
king edward iv what service wilt thou do me if i give them
lady grey what you command that rests in me to do
king edward iv but you will take exceptions to my boon
lady grey no gracious lord except i cannot do it
king edward iv ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask
lady grey why then i will do what your grace commands
gloucester aside to clarence he plies her hard and much rain
 wears the marble
clarence aside to gloucester as red as fire nay then
 her wax must melt
lady grey why stops my lord shall i not hear my task
king edward iv an easy task tis but to love a king
lady grey that's soon perform'd because i am a subject
king edward iv why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee
lady grey i take my leave with many thousand thanks
gloucester aside to clarence the match is made she seals it
 with a curtsy
king edward iv but stay thee tis the fruits of love i mean
lady grey the fruits of love i mean my loving liege
king edward iv ay but i fear me in another sense
 what love think'st thou i sue so much to get
lady grey my love till death my humble thanks my prayers
 that love which virtue begs and virtue grants
king edward iv no by my troth i did not mean such love
lady grey why then you mean not as i thought you did
king edward iv but now you partly may perceive my mind
lady grey my mind will never grant what i perceive
 your highness aims at if i aim aright
king edward iv to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee
lady grey to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison
king edward iv why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands
lady grey why then mine honesty shall be my dower
 for by that loss i will not purchase them
king edward iv therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily
lady grey herein your highness wrongs both them and me
 but mighty lord this merry inclination
 accords not with the sadness of my suit
 please you dismiss me either with ay or no'
king edward iv ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
 no if thou dost say no to my demand
lady grey then no my lord my suit is at an end
gloucester aside to clarence the widow likes him not she
 knits her brows
clarence aside to gloucester he is the bluntest wooer in
 christendom
king edward iv aside her looks do argue her replete with modesty
 her words do show her wit incomparable
 all her perfections challenge sovereignty
 one way or other she is for a king
 and she shall be my love or else my queen
 say that king edward take thee for his queen
lady grey tis better said than done my gracious lord
 i am a subject fit to jest withal
 but far unfit to be a sovereign
king edward iv sweet widow by my state i swear to thee
 i speak no more than what my soul intends
 and that is to enjoy thee for my love
lady grey and that is more than i will yield unto
 i know i am too mean to be your queen
 and yet too good to be your concubine
king edward iv you cavil widow i did mean my queen
lady grey twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father
king edward iv no more than when my daughters call thee mother
 thou art a widow and thou hast some children
 and by god's mother i being but a bachelor
 have other some why tis a happy thing
 to be the father unto many sons
 answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
gloucester aside to clarence the ghostly father now hath done
 his shrift
clarence aside to gloucester when he was made a shriver
 twas for shift
king edward iv brothers you muse what chat we two have had
gloucester the widow likes it not for she looks very sad
king edward iv you'll think it strange if i should marry her
clarence to whom my lord
king edward iv why clarence to myself
gloucester that would be ten days wonder at the least
clarence that's a day longer than a wonder lasts
gloucester by so much is the wonder in extremes
king edward iv well jest on brothers i can tell you both
 her suit is granted for her husband's lands
 enter a nobleman
nobleman my gracious lord henry your foe is taken
 and brought your prisoner to your palace gate
king edward iv see that he be convey'd unto the tower
 and go we brothers to the man that took him
 to question of his apprehension
 widow go you along lords use her honourably
 exeunt all but gloucester
gloucester ay edward will use women honourably
 would he were wasted marrow bones and all
 that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
 to cross me from the golden time i look for
 and yet between my soul's desire and me
 the lustful edward's title buried
 is clarence henry and his son young edward
 and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies
 to take their rooms ere i can place myself
 a cold premeditation for my purpose
 why then i do but dream on sovereignty
 like one that stands upon a promontory
 and spies a faroff shore where he would tread
 wishing his foot were equal with his eye
 and chides the sea that sunders him from thence
 saying he'll lade it dry to have his way
 so do i wish the crown being so far off
 and so i chide the means that keeps me from it
 and so i say i'll cut the causes off
 flattering me with impossibilities
 my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much
 unless my hand and strength could equal them
 well say there is no kingdom then for richard
 what other pleasure can the world afford
 i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap
 and deck my body in gay ornaments
 and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
 o miserable thought and more unlikely
 than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
 why love forswore me in my mother's womb
 and for i should not deal in her soft laws
 she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
 to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub
 to make an envious mountain on my back
 where sits deformity to mock my body
 to shape my legs of an unequal size
 to disproportion me in every part
 like to a chaos or an unlick'd bearwhelp
 that carries no impression like the dam
 and am i then a man to be beloved
 o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
 then since this earth affords no joy to me
 but to command to cheque to o'erbear such
 as are of better person than myself
 i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown
 and whiles i live to account this world but hell
 until my misshaped trunk that bears this head
 be round impaled with a glorious crown
 and yet i know not how to get the crown
 for many lives stand between me and home
 and ilike one lost in a thorny wood
 that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns
 seeking a way and straying from the way
 not knowing how to find the open air
 but toiling desperately to find it out
 torment myself to catch the english crown
 and from that torment i will free myself
 or hew my way out with a bloody axe
 why i can smile and murder whiles i smile
 and cry content to that which grieves my heart
 and wet my cheeks with artificial tears
 and frame my face to all occasions
 i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
 i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk
 i'll play the orator as well as nestor
 deceive more slily than ulysses could
 and like a sinon take another troy
 i can add colours to the chameleon
 change shapes with proteus for advantages
 and set the murderous machiavel to school
 can i do this and cannot get a crown
 tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down

act iii
scene iii france king lewis xi's palace
 flourish enter king lewis xi his sister bona
 his admiral called bourbon prince edward queen
 margaret and oxford king lewis xi sits and
 riseth up again
king lewis xi fair queen of england worthy margaret
 sit down with us it ill befits thy state
 and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit
queen margaret no mighty king of france now margaret
 must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
 where kings command i was i must confess
 great albion's queen in former golden days
 but now mischance hath trod my title down
 and with dishonour laid me on the ground
 where i must take like seat unto my fortune
 and to my humble seat conform myself
king lewis xi why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
queen margaret from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
 and stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares
king lewis xi whate'er it be be thou still like thyself
 and sit thee by our side
 seats her by him
 yield not thy neck
 to fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind
 still ride in triumph over all mischance
 be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief
 it shall be eased if france can yield relief
queen margaret those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
 and give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak
 now therefore be it known to noble lewis
 that henry sole possessor of my love
 is of a king become a banish'd man
 and forced to live in scotland a forlorn
 while proud ambitious edward duke of york
 usurps the regal title and the seat
 of england's trueanointed lawful king
 this is the cause that i poor margaret
 with this my son prince edward henry's heir
 am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
 and if thou fail us all our hope is done
 scotland hath will to help but cannot help
 our people and our peers are both misled
 our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight
 and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
king lewis xi renowned queen with patience calm the storm
 while we bethink a means to break it off
queen margaret the more we stay the stronger grows our foe
king lewis xi the more i stay the more i'll succor thee
queen margaret o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
 and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
 enter warwick
king lewis xi what's he approacheth boldly to our presence
queen margaret our earl of warwick edward's greatest friend
king lewis xi welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france
 he descends she ariseth
queen margaret ay now begins a second storm to rise
 for this is he that moves both wind and tide
warwick from worthy edward king of albion
 my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
 i come in kindness and unfeigned love
 first to do greetings to thy royal person
 and then to crave a league of amity
 and lastly to confirm that amity
 with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
 that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister
 to england's king in lawful marriage
queen margaret aside if that go forward henry's hope is done
warwick to bona and gracious madam in our king's behalf
 i am commanded with your leave and favour
 humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
 to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart
 where fame late entering at his heedful ears
 hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue
queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak
 before you answer warwick his demand
 springs not from edward's wellmeant honest love
 but from deceit bred by necessity
 for how can tyrants safely govern home
 unless abroad they purchase great alliance
 to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
 that henry liveth still but were he dead
 yet here prince edward stands king henry's son
 look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage
 thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
 for though usurpers sway the rule awhile
 yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs
warwick injurious margaret
prince edward and why not queen
warwick because thy father henry did usurp
 and thou no more are prince than she is queen
oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt
 which did subdue the greatest part of spain
 and after john of gaunt henry the fourth
 whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
 and after that wise prince henry the fifth
 who by his prowess conquered all france
 from these our henry lineally descends
warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
 you told not how henry the sixth hath lost
 all that which henry fifth had gotten
 methinks these peers of france should smile at that
 but for the rest you tell a pedigree
 of threescore and two years a silly time
 to make prescription for a kingdom's worth
oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
 whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years
 and not bewray thy treason with a blush
warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right
 now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
 for shame leave henry and call edward king
oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom
 my elder brother the lord aubrey vere
 was done to death and more than so my father
 even in the downfall of his mellow'd years
 when nature brought him to the door of death
 no warwick no while life upholds this arm
 this arm upholds the house of lancaster
warwick and i the house of york
king lewis xi queen margaret prince edward and oxford
 vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
 while i use further conference with warwick
 they stand aloof
queen margaret heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not
king lewis xi now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
 is edward your true king for i were loath
 to link with him that were not lawful chosen
warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour
king lewis xi but is he gracious in the people's eye
warwick the more that henry was unfortunate
king lewis xi then further all dissembling set aside
 tell me for truth the measure of his love
 unto our sister bona
warwick such it seems
 as may beseem a monarch like himself
 myself have often heard him say and swear
 that this his love was an eternal plant
 whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground
 the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun
 exempt from envy but not from disdain
 unless the lady bona quit his pain
king lewis xi now sister let us hear your firm resolve
bona your grant or your denial shall be mine
 to warwick
 yet i confess that often ere this day
 when i have heard your king's desert recounted
 mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
king lewis xi then warwick thus our sister shall be edward's
 and now forthwith shall articles be drawn
 touching the jointure that your king must make
 which with her dowry shall be counterpoised
 draw near queen margaret and be a witness
 that bona shall be wife to the english king
prince edward to edward but not to the english king
queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device
 by this alliance to make void my suit
 before thy coming lewis was henry's friend
king lewis xi and still is friend to him and margaret
 but if your title to the crown be weak
 as may appear by edward's good success
 then tis but reason that i be released
 from giving aid which late i promised
 yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
 that your estate requires and mine can yield
warwick henry now lives in scotland at his ease
 where having nothing nothing can he lose
 and as for you yourself our quondam queen
 you have a father able to maintain you
 and better twere you troubled him than france
queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick peace
 proud setter up and puller down of kings
 i will not hence till with my talk and tears
 both full of truth i make king lewis behold
 thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love
 for both of you are birds of selfsame feather
 post blows a horn within
king lewis xi warwick this is some post to us or thee
 enter a post
post to warwick my lord ambassador these letters are for you
 sent from your brother marquess montague
 to king lewis xi
 these from our king unto your majesty
 to queen margaret
 and madam these for you from whom i know not
 they all read their letters
oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress
 smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his
prince edward nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled
 i hope all's for the best
king lewis xi warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen
queen margaret mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys
warwick mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent
king lewis xi what has your king married the lady grey
 and now to soothe your forgery and his
 sends me a paper to persuade me patience
 is this the alliance that he seeks with france
 dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
queen margaret i told your majesty as much before
 this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty
warwick king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven
 and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss
 that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's
 no more my king for he dishonours me
 but most himself if he could see his shame
 did i forget that by the house of york
 my father came untimely to his death
 did i let pass the abuse done to my niece
 did i impale him with the regal crown
 did i put henry from his native right
 and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame
 shame on himself for my desert is honour
 and to repair my honour lost for him
 i here renounce him and return to henry
 my noble queen let former grudges pass
 and henceforth i am thy true servitor
 i will revenge his wrong to lady bona
 and replant henry in his former state
queen margaret warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love
 and i forgive and quite forget old faults
 and joy that thou becomest king henry's friend
warwick so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
 that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
 with some few bands of chosen soldiers
 i'll undertake to land them on our coast
 and force the tyrant from his seat by war
 tis not his newmade bride shall succor him
 and as for clarence as my letters tell me
 he's very likely now to fall from him
 for matching more for wanton lust than honour
 or than for strength and safety of our country
bona dear brother how shall bona be revenged
 but by thy help to this distressed queen
queen margaret renowned prince how shall poor henry live
 unless thou rescue him from foul despair
bona my quarrel and this english queen's are one
warwick and mine fair lady bona joins with yours
king lewis xi and mine with hers and thine and margaret's
 therefore at last i firmly am resolved
 you shall have aid
queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once
king lewis xi then england's messenger return in post
 and tell false edward thy supposed king
 that lewis of france is sending over masquers
 to revel it with him and his new bride
 thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal
bona tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
 i'll wear the willow garland for his sake
queen margaret tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
 and i am ready to put armour on
warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
 and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long
 there's thy reward be gone
 exit post
king lewis xi but warwick
 thou and oxford with five thousand men
 shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle
 and as occasion serves this noble queen
 and prince shall follow with a fresh supply
 yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
 what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty
 that if our queen and this young prince agree
 i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
 to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
queen margaret yes i agree and thank you for your motion
 son edward she is fair and virtuous
 therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick
 and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
 that only warwick's daughter shall be thine
prince edward yes i accept her for she well deserves it
 and here to pledge my vow i give my hand
 he gives his hand to warwick
king lewis xi why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied
 and thou lord bourbon our high admiral
 shalt waft them over with our royal fleet
 i long till edward fall by war's mischance
 for mocking marriage with a dame of france
 exeunt all but warwick
warwick i came from edward as ambassador
 but i return his sworn and mortal foe
 matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
 but dreadful war shall answer his demand
 had he none else to make a stale but me
 then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow
 i was the chief that raised him to the crown

act iv
scene i london the palace
 enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague
gloucester now tell me brother clarence what think you
 of this new marriage with the lady grey
 hath not our brother made a worthy choice
clarence alas you know tis far from hence to france
 how could he stay till warwick made return
somerset my lords forbear this talk here comes the king
gloucester and his wellchosen bride
clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think
 flourish enter king edward iv attended queen
 elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and others
king edward iv now brother of clarence how like you our choice
 that you stand pensive as half malcontent
clarence as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick
 which are so weak of courage and in judgment
 that they'll take no offence at our abuse
king edward iv suppose they take offence without a cause
 they are but lewis and warwick i am edward
 your king and warwick's and must have my will
gloucester and shall have your will because our king
 yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
king edward iv yea brother richard are you offended too
gloucester not i
 no god forbid that i should wish them sever'd
 whom god hath join'd together ay and twere pity
 to sunder them that yoke so well together
king edward iv setting your scorns and your mislike aside
 tell me some reason why the lady grey
 should not become my wife and england's queen
 and you too somerset and montague
 speak freely what you think
clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis
 becomes your enemy for mocking him
 about the marriage of the lady bona
gloucester and warwick doing what you gave in charge
 is now dishonoured by this new marriage
king edward iv what if both lewis and warwick be appeased
 by such invention as i can devise
montague yet to have join'd with france in such alliance
 would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
 gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage
hastings why knows not montague that of itself
 england is safe if true within itself
montague but the safer when tis back'd with france
hastings tis better using france than trusting france
 let us be back'd with god and with the seas
 which he hath given for fence impregnable
 and with their helps only defend ourselves
 in them and in ourselves our safety lies
clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserves
 to have the heir of the lord hungerford
king edward iv ay what of that it was my will and grant
 and for this once my will shall stand for law
gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well
 to give the heir and daughter of lord scales
 unto the brother of your loving bride
 she better would have fitted me or clarence
 but in your bride you bury brotherhood
clarence or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
 of the lord bonville on your new wife's son
 and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
king edward iv alas poor clarence is it for a wife
 that thou art malcontent i will provide thee
clarence in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment
 which being shallow you give me leave
 to play the broker in mine own behalf
 and to that end i shortly mind to leave you
king edward iv leave me or tarry edward will be king
 and not be tied unto his brother's will
queen elizabeth my lords before it pleased his majesty
 to raise my state to title of a queen
 do me but right and you must all confess
 that i was not ignoble of descent
 and meaner than myself have had like fortune
 but as this title honours me and mine
 so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing
 doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
king edward iv my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
 what danger or what sorrow can befall thee
 so long as edward is thy constant friend
 and their true sovereign whom they must obey
 nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
 unless they seek for hatred at my hands
 which if they do yet will i keep thee safe
 and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
gloucester aside i hear yet say not much but think the more
 enter a post
king edward iv now messenger what letters or what news
 from france
post my sovereign liege no letters and few words
 but such as i without your special pardon
 dare not relate
king edward iv go to we pardon thee therefore in brief
 tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
 what answer makes king lewis unto our letters
post at my depart these were his very words
 go tell false edward thy supposed king
 that lewis of france is sending over masquers
 to revel it with him and his new bride'
king edward iv is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry
 but what said lady bona to my marriage
post these were her words utter'd with mad disdain
 tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
 i'll wear the willow garland for his sake'
king edward iv i blame not her she could say little less
 she had the wrong but what said henry's queen
 for i have heard that she was there in place
post tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
 and i am ready to put armour on'
king edward iv belike she minds to play the amazon
 but what said warwick to these injuries
post he more incensed against your majesty
 than all the rest discharged me with these words
 tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
 and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long'
king edward iv ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
 well i will arm me being thus forewarn'd
 they shall have wars and pay for their presumption
 but say is warwick friends with margaret
post ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in
 friendship
 that young prince edward marries warwick's daughter
clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger
 now brother king farewell and sit you fast
 for i will hence to warwick's other daughter
 that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage
 i may not prove inferior to yourself
 you that love me and warwick follow me
 exit clarence and somerset follows
gloucester aside not i
 my thoughts aim at a further matter i
 stay not for the love of edward but the crown
king edward iv clarence and somerset both gone to warwick
 yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen
 and haste is needful in this desperate case
 pembroke and stafford you in our behalf
 go levy men and make prepare for war
 they are already or quickly will be landed
 myself in person will straight follow you
 exeunt pembroke and stafford
 but ere i go hastings and montague
 resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest
 are near to warwick by blood and by alliance
 tell me if you love warwick more than me
 if it be so then both depart to him
 i rather wish you foes than hollow friends
 but if you mind to hold your true obedience
 give me assurance with some friendly vow
 that i may never have you in suspect
montague so god help montague as he proves true
hastings and hastings as he favours edward's cause
king edward iv now brother richard will you stand by us
gloucester ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
king edward iv why so then am i sure of victory
 now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
 till we meet warwick with his foreign power

 enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers
warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
 the common people by numbers swarm to us
 enter clarence and somerset
 but see where somerset and clarence come
 speak suddenly my lords are we all friends
clarence fear not that my lord
warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick
 and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice
 to rest mistrustful where a noble heart
 hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love
 else might i think that clarence edward's brother
 were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
 but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine
 and now what rests but in night's coverture
 thy brother being carelessly encamp'd
 his soldiers lurking in the towns about
 and but attended by a simple guard
 we may surprise and take him at our pleasure
 our scouts have found the adventure very easy
 that as ulysses and stout diomede
 with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents
 and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds
 so we well cover'd with the night's black mantle
 at unawares may beat down edward's guard
 and seize himself i say not slaughter him
 for i intend but only to surprise him
 you that will follow me to this attempt
 applaud the name of henry with your leader
 they all cry henry'
 why then let's on our way in silent sort
 for warwick and his friends god and saint george

 never to lie and take his natural rest
 till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd
second watchman tomorrow then belike shall be the day
 if warwick be so near as men report
third watchman but say i pray what nobleman is that
 that with the king here resteth in his tent
first watchman tis the lord hastings the king's chiefest friend
third watchman o is it so but why commands the king
 that his chief followers lodge in towns about him
 while he himself keeps in the cold field
second watchman tis the more honour because more dangerous
third watchman ay but give me worship and quietness
 i like it better than a dangerous honour
 if warwick knew in what estate he stands
 tis to be doubted he would waken him
first watchman unless our halberds did shut up his passage
second watchman ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
 but to defend his person from nightfoes
 enter warwick clarence oxford somerset and
 french soldiers silent all
warwick this is his tent and see where stand his guard

 thou call'dst me king
warwick ay but the case is alter'd
 when you disgraced me in my embassade
 then i degraded you from being king
 and come now to create you duke of york
 alas how should you govern any kingdom
 that know not how to use ambassadors
 nor how to be contented with one wife
 nor how to use your brothers brotherly
 nor how to study for the people's welfare
 nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
king edward iv yea brother of clarence are thou here too
 nay then i see that edward needs must down
 yet warwick in despite of all mischance
 of thee thyself and all thy complices
 edward will always bear himself as king
 though fortune's malice overthrow my state
 my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
warwick then for his mind be edward england's king
 takes off his crown
 but henry now shall wear the english crown
 and be true king indeed thou but the shadow
 my lord of somerset at my request
 see that forthwith duke edward be convey'd
 unto my brother archbishop of york
 when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows
 i'll follow you and tell what answer
 lewis and the lady bona send to him

rivers madam what makes you in this sudden change
queen elizabeth why brother rivers are you yet to learn
 what late misfortune is befall'n king edward
rivers what loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick
queen elizabeth no but the loss of his own royal person
rivers then is my sovereign slain
queen elizabeth ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
 either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
 or by his foe surprised at unawares
 and as i further have to understand
 is new committed to the bishop of york
 fell warwick's brother and by that our foe
rivers these news i must confess are full of grief
 yet gracious madam bear it as you may
 warwick may lose that now hath won the day
queen elizabeth till then fair hope must hinder life's decay
 and i the rather wean me from despair
 for love of edward's offspring in my womb
 this is it that makes me bridle passion
 and bear with mildness my misfortune's cross
 ay ay for this i draw in many a tear
 and stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs
 lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown
 king edward's fruit true heir to the english crown
rivers but madam where is warwick then become
queen elizabeth i am inform'd that he comes towards london
 to set the crown once more on henry's head
 guess thou the rest king edward's friends must down
 but to prevent the tyrant's violence
 for trust not him that hath once broken faith
 i'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
 to save at least the heir of edward's right
 there shall i rest secure from force and fraud

 into this chiefest thicket of the park
 thus stands the case you know our king my brother
 is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands
 he hath good usage and great liberty
 and often but attended with weak guard
 comes hunting this way to disport himself
 i have advertised him by secret means
 that if about this hour he make his way
 under the colour of his usual game
 he shall here find his friends with horse and men
 to set him free from his captivity
 enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him
huntsman this way my lord for this way lies the game
king edward iv nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand
 now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest
 stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer
gloucester brother the time and case requireth haste
 your horse stands ready at the parkcorner
king edward iv but whither shall we then
hastings to lynn my lord

gloucester well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning
king edward iv stanley i will requite thy forwardness
gloucester but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk
king edward iv huntsman what say'st thou wilt thou go along
huntsman better do so than tarry and be hang'd
gloucester come then away let's ha no more ado

 flourish enter king henry vi clarence warwick
 somerset henry of richmond oxford montague and
 lieutenant of the tower
king henry vi master lieutenant now that god and friends
 have shaken edward from the regal seat
 and turn'd my captive state to liberty
 my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
 at our enlargement what are thy due fees
lieutenant subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns
 but if an humble prayer may prevail
 i then crave pardon of your majesty
king henry vi for what lieutenant for well using me
 nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness
 for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
 ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
 conceive when after many moody thoughts
 at last by notes of household harmony
 they quite forget their loss of liberty
 but warwick after god thou set'st me free
 and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee
 he was the author thou the instrument
 therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite
 by living low where fortune cannot hurt me
 and that the people of this blessed land
 may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars
 warwick although my head still wear the crown
 i here resign my government to thee
 for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
warwick your grace hath still been famed for virtuous
 and now may seem as wise as virtuous
 by spying and avoiding fortune's malice
 for few men rightly temper with the stars
 yet in this one thing let me blame your grace
 for choosing me when clarence is in place
clarence no warwick thou art worthy of the sway
 to whom the heavens in thy nativity
 adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
 as likely to be blest in peace and war
 and therefore i yield thee my free consent
warwick and i choose clarence only for protector
king henry vi warwick and clarence give me both your hands
 now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
 that no dissension hinder government
 i make you both protectors of this land
 while i myself will lead a private life
 and in devotion spend my latter days
 to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise
warwick what answers clarence to his sovereign's will
clarence that he consents if warwick yield consent
 for on thy fortune i repose myself
warwick why then though loath yet must i be content
 we'll yoke together like a double shadow
 to henry's body and supply his place
 i mean in bearing weight of government
 while he enjoys the honour and his ease
 and clarence now then it is more than needful
 forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor
 and all his lands and goods be confiscate
clarence what else and that succession be determined
warwick ay therein clarence shall not want his part
king henry vi but with the first of all your chief affairs
 let me entreat for i command no more
 that margaret your queen and my son edward
 be sent for to return from france with speed
 for till i see them here by doubtful fear
 my joy of liberty is half eclipsed
clarence it shall be done my sovereign with all speed
king henry vi my lord of somerset what youth is that
 of whom you seem to have so tender care
somerset my liege it is young henry earl of richmond
king henry vi come hither england's hope
 lays his hand on his head
 if secret powers
 suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
 this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss
 his looks are full of peaceful majesty
 his head by nature framed to wear a crown
 his hand to wield a sceptre and himself
 likely in time to bless a regal throne
 make much of him my lords for this is he
 must help you more than you are hurt by me
 enter a post
warwick what news my friend
post that edward is escaped from your brother
 and fled as he hears since to burgundy
warwick unsavoury news but how made he escape
post he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester
 and the lord hastings who attended him
 in secret ambush on the forest side
 and from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him
 for hunting was his daily exercise
warwick my brother was too careless of his charge
 but let us hence my sovereign to provide
 a salve for any sore that may betide
 exeunt all but somerset henry of richmond and oxford
somerset my lord i like not of this flight of edward's
 for doubtless burgundy will yield him help
 and we shall have more wars before t be long
 as henry's late presaging prophecy
 did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond
 so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
 what may befall him to his harm and ours
 therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst
 forthwith we'll send him hence to brittany
 till storms be past of civil enmity
oxford ay for if edward repossess the crown
 tis like that richmond with the rest shall down
somerset it shall be so he shall to brittany

 what then remains we being thus arrived
 from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york
 but that we enter as into our dukedom
gloucester the gates made fast brother i like not this
 for many men that stumble at the threshold
 are well foretold that danger lurks within
king edward iv tush man abodements must not now affright us
 by fair or foul means we must enter in
 for hither will our friends repair to us
hastings my liege i'll knock once more to summon them
 enter on the walls the mayor of york and his brethren
mayor my lords we were forewarned of your coming
 and shut the gates for safety of ourselves
 for now we owe allegiance unto henry
king edward iv but master mayor if henry be your king
 yet edward at the least is duke of york
mayor true my good lord i know you for no less
king edward iv why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom
 as being well content with that alone
gloucester aside but when the fox hath once got in his nose
 he'll soon find means to make the body follow
hastings why master mayor why stand you in a doubt
 open the gates we are king henry's friends
mayor ay say you so the gates shall then be open'd
 they descend

hastings the good old man would fain that all were well
 so twere not long of him but being enter'd

king edward iv thanks good montgomery but we now forget
 our title to the crown and only claim
 our dukedom till god please to send the rest
montague then fare you well for i will hence again
 i came to serve a king and not a duke
 drummer strike up and let us march away
 the drum begins to march
king edward iv nay stay sir john awhile and we'll debate
 by what safe means the crown may be recover'd
montague what talk you of debating in few words
 if you'll not here proclaim yourself our king
 i'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
 to keep them back that come to succor you
 why shall we fight if you pretend no title
gloucester why brother wherefore stand you on nice points
king edward iv when we grow stronger then we'll make our claim
 till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning
hastings away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule
gloucester and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
 brother we will proclaim you out of hand
 the bruit thereof will bring you many friends
king edward iv then be it as you will for tis my right

 my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs
 my mercy dried their waterflowing tears

 with whom an upright zeal to right prevails
 more than the nature of a brother's love
 come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call
clarence father of warwick know you what this means
 taking his red rose out of his hat
 look here i throw my infamy at thee
 i will not ruinate my father's house
 who gave his blood to lime the stones together
 and set up lancaster why trow'st thou warwick
 that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
 to bend the fatal instruments of war
 against his brother and his lawful king
 perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
 to keep that oath were more impiety
 than jephthah's when he sacrificed his daughter
 i am so sorry for my trespass made
 that to deserve well at my brother's hands
 i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
 with resolution wheresoe'er i meet thee
 as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad
 to plague thee for thy foul misleading me
 and so proudhearted warwick i defy thee
 and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
 pardon me edward i will make amends
 and richard do not frown upon my faults
 for i will henceforth be no more unconstant
king edward iv now welcome more and ten times more beloved
 than if thou never hadst deserved our hate
gloucester welcome good clarence this is brotherlike
warwick o passing traitor perjured and unjust
king edward iv what warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight
 or shall we beat the stones about thine ears
warwick alas i am not coop'd here for defence
 i will away towards barnet presently

warwick ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe
 and tell me who is victor york or warwick
 why ask i that my mangled body shows
 my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
 that i must yield my body to the earth
 and by my fall the conquest to my foe
 thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge
 whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
 under whose shade the ramping lion slept
 whose topbranch overpeer'd jove's spreading tree
 and kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind
 these eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil
 have been as piercing as the midday sun
 to search the secret treasons of the world
 the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood
 were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres
 for who lived king but i could dig his grave
 and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow
 lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood
 my parks my walks my manors that i had
 even now forsake me and of all my lands
 is nothing left me but my body's length
 why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
 and live we how we can yet die we must
 enter oxford and somerset
somerset ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are
 we might recover all our loss again
 the queen from france hath brought a puissant power
 even now we heard the news ah could'st thou fly
warwick why then i would not fly ah montague
 if thou be there sweet brother take my hand
 and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
 thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst
 thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
 that glues my lips and will not let me speak
 come quickly montague or i am dead
somerset ah warwick montague hath breathed his last
 and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick
 and said commend me to my valiant brother'
 and more he would have said and more he spoke
 which sounded like a clamour in a vault
 that mought not be distinguished but at last
 i well might hear delivered with a groan
 o farewell warwick'

 for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven

 have now the fatal object in my eye
 where my poor young was limed was caught and kill'd

 thy brother edward and thyself the sea
 whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
 ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
 my breast can better brook thy dagger's point
 than can my ears that tragic history
 but wherefore dost thou come is't for my life
gloucester think'st thou i am an executioner
king henry vi a persecutor i am sure thou art
 if murdering innocents be executing
 why then thou art an executioner
gloucester thy son i kill'd for his presumption
king henry vi hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume
 thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine
 and thus i prophesy that many a thousand
 which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
 and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's
 and many an orphan's waterstanding eye
 men for their sons wives for their husbands
 and orphans for their parents timeless death

 the owl shriek'd at thy birthan evil sign

 dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees
 the raven rook'd her on the chimney's top
 and chattering pies in dismal discords sung
 thy mother felt more than a mother's pain
 and yet brought forth less than a mother's hope
 to wit an indigested and deformed lump
 not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
 teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
 to signify thou camest to bite the world
 and if the rest be true which i have heard
 thou camest

 god forgive my sins and pardon thee

 sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted
 see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death
 o may such purple tears be alway shed
 from those that wish the downfall of our house
 if any spark of life be yet remaining
 down down to hell and say i sent thee thither
 stabs him again
 i that have neither pity love nor fear
 indeed tis true that henry told me of
 for i have often heard my mother say
 i came into the world with my legs forward
 had i not reason think ye to make haste
 and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right
 the midwife wonder'd and the women cried
 o jesus bless us he is born with teeth'
 and so i was which plainly signified
 that i should snarl and bite and play the dog
 then since the heavens have shaped my body so
 let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it
 i have no brother i am like no brother
 and this word love which graybeards call divine
 be resident in men like one another
 and not in me i am myself alone
 clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light
 but i will sort a pitchy day for thee
 for i will buz abroad such prophecies
 that edward shall be fearful of his life
 and then to purge his fear i'll be thy death
 king henry and the prince his son are gone
 clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
 counting myself but bad till i be best
 i'll throw thy body in another room

act i
scene i london an antechamber in the king's palace
 enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
canterbury my lord i'll tell you that self bill is urged
 which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
 was like and had indeed against us pass'd
 but that the scambling and unquiet time
 did push it out of farther question
ely but how my lord shall we resist it now
canterbury it must be thought on if it pass against us
 we lose the better half of our possession
 for all the temporal lands which men devout
 by testament have given to the church
 would they strip from us being valued thus
 as much as would maintain to the king's honour
 full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
 six thousand and two hundred good esquires
 and to relief of lazars and weak age
 of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
 a hundred almshouses right well supplied
 and to the coffers of the king beside
 a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill
ely this would drink deep
canterbury twould drink the cup and all
ely but what prevention
canterbury the king is full of grace and fair regard
ely and a true lover of the holy church
canterbury the courses of his youth promised it not
 the breath no sooner left his father's body
 but that his wildness mortified in him
 seem'd to die too yea at that very moment
 consideration like an angel came
 and whipp'd the offending adam out of him
 leaving his body as a paradise
 to envelop and contain celestial spirits
 never was such a sudden scholar made
 never came reformation in a flood
 with such a heady currance scouring faults
 nor never hydraheaded wilfulness
 so soon did lose his seat and all at once
 as in this king
ely we are blessed in the change
canterbury hear him but reason in divinity
 and alladmiring with an inward wish
 you would desire the king were made a prelate
 hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
 you would say it hath been all in all his study
 list his discourse of war and you shall hear
 a fearful battle render'd you in music
 turn him to any cause of policy
 the gordian knot of it he will unloose
 familiar as his garter that when he speaks
 the air a charter'd libertine is still
 and the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
 to steal his sweet and honey'd sentences
 so that the art and practic part of life
 must be the mistress to this theoric
 which is a wonder how his grace should glean it
 since his addiction was to courses vain
 his companies unletter'd rude and shallow
 his hours fill'd up with riots banquets sports
 and never noted in him any study
 any retirement any sequestration
 from open haunts and popularity
ely the strawberry grows underneath the nettle
 and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
 neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality
 and so the prince obscured his contemplation
 under the veil of wildness which no doubt
 grew like the summer grass fastest by night
 unseen yet crescive in his faculty
canterbury it must be so for miracles are ceased
 and therefore we must needs admit the means
 how things are perfected
ely but my good lord
 how now for mitigation of this bill
 urged by the commons doth his majesty
 incline to it or no
canterbury he seems indifferent
 or rather swaying more upon our part
 than cherishing the exhibiters against us
 for i have made an offer to his majesty
 upon our spiritual convocation
 and in regard of causes now in hand
 which i have open'd to his grace at large
 as touching france to give a greater sum
 than ever at one time the clergy yet
 did to his predecessors part withal
ely how did this offer seem received my lord
canterbury with good acceptance of his majesty
 save that there was not time enough to hear
 as i perceived his grace would fain have done
 the severals and unhidden passages
 of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
 and generally to the crown and seat of france
 derived from edward his greatgrandfather
ely what was the impediment that broke this off
canterbury the french ambassador upon that instant
 craved audience and the hour i think is come
 to give him hearing is it four o'clock
ely it is
canterbury then go we in to know his embassy
 which i could with a ready guess declare
 before the frenchman speak a word of it
ely i'll wait upon you and i long to hear it

 before we hear him of some things of weight
 that task our thoughts concerning us and france
 enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
canterbury god and his angels guard your sacred throne
 and make you long become it
king henry v sure we thank you
 my learned lord we pray you to proceed
 and justly and religiously unfold
 why the law salique that they have in france
 or should or should not bar us in our claim
 and god forbid my dear and faithful lord
 that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
 or nicely charge your understanding soul
 with opening titles miscreate whose right
 suits not in native colours with the truth
 for god doth know how many now in health
 shall drop their blood in approbation
 of what your reverence shall incite us to
 therefore take heed how you impawn our person
 how you awake our sleeping sword of war
 we charge you in the name of god take heed
 for never two such kingdoms did contend
 without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
 are every one a woe a sore complaint
 gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
 that make such waste in brief mortality
 under this conjuration speak my lord
 for we will hear note and believe in heart
 that what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
 as pure as sin with baptism
canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
 that owe yourselves your lives and services
 to this imperial throne there is no bar
 to make against your highness claim to france
 but this which they produce from pharamond
 in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant'
 no woman shall succeed in salique land'
 which salique land the french unjustly gloze
 to be the realm of france and pharamond
 the founder of this law and female bar
 yet their own authors faithfully affirm
 that the land salique is in germany
 between the floods of sala and of elbe
 where charles the great having subdued the saxons
 there left behind and settled certain french
 who holding in disdain the german women
 for some dishonest manners of their life
 establish'd then this law to wit no female
 should be inheritrix in salique land
 which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala
 is at this day in germany call'd meisen
 then doth it well appear that salique law
 was not devised for the realm of france
 nor did the french possess the salique land
 until four hundred one and twenty years
 after defunction of king pharamond
 idly supposed the founder of this law
 who died within the year of our redemption
 four hundred twentysix and charles the great
 subdued the saxons and did seat the french
 beyond the river sala in the year
 eight hundred five besides their writers say
 king pepin which deposed childeric
 did as heir general being descended
 of blithild which was daughter to king clothair
 make claim and title to the crown of france
 hugh capet also who usurped the crown
 of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male
 of the true line and stock of charles the great
 to find his title with some shows of truth
 through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
 convey'd himself as heir to the lady lingare
 daughter to charlemain who was the son
 to lewis the emperor and lewis the son
 of charles the great also king lewis the tenth
 who was sole heir to the usurper capet
 could not keep quiet in his conscience
 wearing the crown of france till satisfied
 that fair queen isabel his grandmother
 was lineal of the lady ermengare
 daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine
 by the which marriage the line of charles the great
 was reunited to the crown of france
 so that as clear as is the summer's sun
 king pepin's title and hugh capet's claim
 king lewis his satisfaction all appear
 to hold in right and title of the female
 so do the kings of france unto this day
 howbeit they would hold up this salique law
 to bar your highness claiming from the female
 and rather choose to hide them in a net
 than amply to imbar their crooked titles
 usurp'd from you and your progenitors
king henry v may i with right and conscience make this claim
canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign
 for in the book of numbers is it writ
 when the man dies let the inheritance
 descend unto the daughter gracious lord
 stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
 look back into your mighty ancestors
 go my dread lord to your greatgrandsire's tomb
 from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
 and your greatuncle's edward the black prince
 who on the french ground play'd a tragedy
 making defeat on the full power of france
 whiles his most mighty father on a hill
 stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
 forage in blood of french nobility
 o noble english that could entertain
 with half their forces the full pride of france
 and let another half stand laughing by
 all out of work and cold for action
ely awake remembrance of these valiant dead
 and with your puissant arm renew their feats
 you are their heir you sit upon their throne
 the blood and courage that renowned them
 runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege
 is in the very maymorn of his youth
 ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
exeter your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
 do all expect that you should rouse yourself
 as did the former lions of your blood
westmoreland they know your grace hath cause and means and might
 so hath your highness never king of england
 had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
 whose hearts have left their bodies here in england
 and lie pavilion'd in the fields of france
canterbury o let their bodies follow my dear liege
 with blood and sword and fire to win your right
 in aid whereof we of the spiritualty
 will raise your highness such a mighty sum
 as never did the clergy at one time
 bring in to any of your ancestors
king henry v we must not only arm to invade the french
 but lay down our proportions to defend
 against the scot who will make road upon us
 with all advantages
canterbury they of those marches gracious sovereign
 shall be a wall sufficient to defend
 our inland from the pilfering borderers
king henry v we do not mean the coursing snatchers only
 but fear the main intendment of the scot
 who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
 for you shall read that my greatgrandfather
 never went with his forces into france
 but that the scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
 came pouring like the tide into a breach
 with ample and brim fulness of his force
 galling the gleaned land with hot assays
 girding with grievous siege castles and towns
 that england being empty of defence
 hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood
canterbury she hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege
 for hear her but exampled by herself
 when all her chivalry hath been in france
 and she a mourning widow of her nobles
 she hath herself not only well defended
 but taken and impounded as a stray
 the king of scots whom she did send to france
 to fill king edward's fame with prisoner kings
 and make her chronicle as rich with praise
 as is the ooze and bottom of the sea
 with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries
westmoreland but there's a saying very old and true
 if that you will france win
 then with scotland first begin'
 for once the eagle england being in prey
 to her unguarded nest the weasel scot
 comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
 playing the mouse in absence of the cat
 to tear and havoc more than she can eat
exeter it follows then the cat must stay at home
 yet that is but a crush'd necessity
 since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
 and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
 while that the armed hand doth fight abroad
 the advised head defends itself at home
 for government though high and low and lower
 put into parts doth keep in one consent
 congreeing in a full and natural close
 like music
canterbury therefore doth heaven divide
 the state of man in divers functions
 setting endeavour in continual motion
 to which is fixed as an aim or butt
 obedience for so work the honeybees
 creatures that by a rule in nature teach
 the act of order to a peopled kingdom
 they have a king and officers of sorts
 where some like magistrates correct at home
 others like merchants venture trade abroad
 others like soldiers armed in their stings
 make boot upon the summer's velvet buds
 which pillage they with merry march bring home
 to the tentroyal of their emperor
 who busied in his majesty surveys
 the singing masons building roofs of gold
 the civil citizens kneading up the honey
 the poor mechanic porters crowding in
 their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
 the sadeyed justice with his surly hum
 delivering o'er to executors pale
 the lazy yawning drone i this infer
 that many things having full reference
 to one consent may work contrariously
 as many arrows loosed several ways
 come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
 as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
 as many lines close in the dial's centre
 so may a thousand actions once afoot
 end in one purpose and be all well borne
 without defeat therefore to france my liege
 divide your happy england into four
 whereof take you one quarter into france
 and you withal shall make all gallia shake
 if we with thrice such powers left at home
 cannot defend our own doors from the dog
 let us be worried and our nation lose
 the name of hardiness and policy
king henry v call in the messengers sent from the dauphin
 exeunt some attendants
 now are we well resolved and by god's help
 and yours the noble sinews of our power
 france being ours we'll bend it to our awe
 or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit
 ruling in large and ample empery
 o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms
 or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
 tombless with no remembrance over them
 either our history shall with full mouth
 speak freely of our acts or else our grave
 like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
 not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph
 enter ambassadors of france
 now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
 of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear
 your greeting is from him not from the king
first ambassador may't please your majesty to give us leave
 freely to render what we have in charge
 or shall we sparingly show you far off
 the dauphin's meaning and our embassy
king henry v we are no tyrant but a christian king
 unto whose grace our passion is as subject
 as are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons
 therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
 tell us the dauphin's mind
first ambassador thus then in few
 your highness lately sending into france
 did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
 of your great predecessor king edward the third
 in answer of which claim the prince our master
 says that you savour too much of your youth
 and bids you be advised there's nought in france
 that can be with a nimble galliard won
 you cannot revel into dukedoms there
 he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
 this tun of treasure and in lieu of this
 desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
 hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks
king henry v what treasure uncle
exeter tennisballs my liege
king henry v we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us
 his present and your pains we thank you for
 when we have march'd our rackets to these balls
 we will in france by god's grace play a set
 shall strike his father's crown into the hazard
 tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
 that all the courts of france will be disturb'd
 with chaces and we understand him well
 how he comes o'er us with our wilder days
 not measuring what use we made of them
 we never valued this poor seat of england
 and therefore living hence did give ourself
 to barbarous licence as tis ever common
 that men are merriest when they are from home
 but tell the dauphin i will keep my state
 be like a king and show my sail of greatness
 when i do rouse me in my throne of france
 for that i have laid by my majesty
 and plodded like a man for workingdays
 but i will rise there with so full a glory
 that i will dazzle all the eyes of france
 yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us
 and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
 hath turn'd his balls to gunstones and his soul
 shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
 that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
 shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands
 mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
 and some are yet ungotten and unborn
 that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn
 but this lies all within the will of god
 to whom i do appeal and in whose name
 tell you the dauphin i am coming on
 to venge me as i may and to put forth
 my rightful hand in a wellhallow'd cause
 so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin
 his jest will savour but of shallow wit
 when thousands weep more than did laugh at it
 convey them with safe conduct fare you well
 exeunt ambassadors
exeter this was a merry message
king henry v we hope to make the sender blush at it
 therefore my lords omit no happy hour
 that may give furtherance to our expedition
 for we have now no thought in us but france
 save those to god that run before our business
 therefore let our proportions for these wars
 be soon collected and all things thought upon
 that may with reasonable swiftness add
 more feathers to our wings for god before
 we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door
 therefore let every man now task his thought
 that this fair action may on foot be brought
 exeunt flourish

 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus now all the youth of england are on fire
 and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
 now thrive the armourers and honour's thought
 reigns solely in the breast of every man
 they sell the pasture now to buy the horse
 following the mirror of all christian kings
 with winged heels as english mercuries
 for now sits expectation in the air
 and hides a sword from hilts unto the point
 with crowns imperial crowns and coronets
 promised to harry and his followers
 the french advised by good intelligence
 of this most dreadful preparation
 shake in their fear and with pale policy
 seek to divert the english purposes
 o england model to thy inward greatness
 like little body with a mighty heart
 what mightst thou do that honour would thee do
 were all thy children kind and natural
 but see thy fault france hath in thee found out
 a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
 with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men
 one richard earl of cambridge and the second
 henry lord scroop of masham and the third
 sir thomas grey knight of northumberland
 have for the gilt of franceo guilt indeed
 confirm'd conspiracy with fearful france
 and by their hands this grace of kings must die
 if hell and treason hold their promises
 ere he take ship for france and in southampton
 linger your patience on and we'll digest
 the abuse of distance force a play
 the sum is paid the traitors are agreed
 the king is set from london and the scene
 is now transported gentles to southampton
 there is the playhouse now there must you sit
 and thence to france shall we convey you safe
 and bring you back charming the narrow seas
 to give you gentle pass for if we may
 we'll not offend one stomach with our play
 but till the king come forth and not till then
 unto southampton do we shift our scene

scene ii southampton a councilchamber
 enter exeter bedford and westmoreland
bedford fore god his grace is bold to trust these traitors
exeter they shall be apprehended by and by
westmoreland how smooth and even they do bear themselves
 as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
 crowned with faith and constant loyalty
bedford the king hath note of all that they intend
 by interception which they dream not of
exeter nay but the man that was his bedfellow
 whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours
 that he should for a foreign purse so sell
 his sovereign's life to death and treachery
 trumpets sound enter king henry v scroop
 cambridge grey and attendants
king henry v now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
 my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham
 and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
 think you not that the powers we bear with us
 will cut their passage through the force of france
 doing the execution and the act
 for which we have in head assembled them
scroop no doubt my liege if each man do his best
king henry v i doubt not that since we are well persuaded
 we carry not a heart with us from hence
 that grows not in a fair consent with ours
 nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
 success and conquest to attend on us
cambridge never was monarch better fear'd and loved
 than is your majesty there's not i think a subject
 that sits in heartgrief and uneasiness
 under the sweet shade of your government
grey true those that were your father's enemies
 have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
 with hearts create of duty and of zeal
king henry v we therefore have great cause of thankfulness
 and shall forget the office of our hand
 sooner than quittance of desert and merit
 according to the weight and worthiness
scroop so service shall with steeled sinews toil
 and labour shall refresh itself with hope
 to do your grace incessant services
king henry v we judge no less uncle of exeter
 enlarge the man committed yesterday
 that rail'd against our person we consider
 it was excess of wine that set him on
 and on his more advice we pardon him
scroop that's mercy but too much security
 let him be punish'd sovereign lest example
 breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
king henry v o let us yet be merciful
cambridge so may your highness and yet punish too
grey sir
 you show great mercy if you give him life
 after the taste of much correction
king henry v alas your too much love and care of me
 are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch
 if little faults proceeding on distemper
 shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye
 when capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested
 appear before us we'll yet enlarge that man
 though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care
 and tender preservation of our person
 would have him punished and now to our french causes
 who are the late commissioners
cambridge i one my lord
 your highness bade me ask for it today
scroop so did you me my liege
grey and i my royal sovereign
king henry v then richard earl of cambridge there is yours
 there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight
 grey of northumberland this same is yours
 read them and know i know your worthiness
 my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter
 we will aboard to night why how now gentlemen
 what see you in those papers that you lose
 so much complexion look ye how they change
 their cheeks are paper why what read you there
 that hath so cowarded and chased your blood
 out of appearance
cambridge i do confess my fault
 and do submit me to your highness mercy
grey 
 to which we all appeal
scroop 
king henry v the mercy that was quick in us but late
 by your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd
 you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
 for your own reasons turn into your bosoms
 as dogs upon their masters worrying you
 see you my princes and my noble peers
 these english monsters my lord of cambridge here
 you know how apt our love was to accord
 to furnish him with all appertinents
 belonging to his honour and this man
 hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired
 and sworn unto the practises of france
 to kill us here in hampton to the which
 this knight no less for bounty bound to us
 than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o
 what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel
 ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
 thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
 that knew'st the very bottom of my soul
 that almost mightst have coin'd me into gold
 wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use
 may it be possible that foreign hire
 could out of thee extract one spark of evil
 that might annoy my finger tis so strange
 that though the truth of it stands off as gross
 as black and white my eye will scarcely see it
 treason and murder ever kept together
 as two yokedevils sworn to either's purpose
 working so grossly in a natural cause
 that admiration did not whoop at them
 but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
 wonder to wait on treason and on murder
 and whatsoever cunning fiend it was
 that wrought upon thee so preposterously
 hath got the voice in hell for excellence
 all other devils that suggest by treasons
 do botch and bungle up damnation
 with patches colours and with forms being fetch'd
 from glistering semblances of piety
 but he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up
 gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
 unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
 if that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
 should with his lion gait walk the whole world
 he might return to vasty tartar back
 and tell the legions i can never win
 a soul so easy as that englishman's'
 o how hast thou with jealousy infected
 the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful
 why so didst thou seem they grave and learned
 why so didst thou come they of noble family
 why so didst thou seem they religious
 why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
 free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
 constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
 garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement
 not working with the eye without the ear
 and but in purged judgment trusting neither
 such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
 and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
 to mark the fullfraught man and best indued
 with some suspicion i will weep for thee
 for this revolt of thine methinks is like
 another fall of man their faults are open
 arrest them to the answer of the law
 and god acquit them of their practises
exeter i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 richard earl of cambridge
 i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 henry lord scroop of masham
 i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 thomas grey knight of northumberland
scroop our purposes god justly hath discover'd
 and i repent my fault more than my death
 which i beseech your highness to forgive
 although my body pay the price of it
cambridge for me the gold of france did not seduce
 although i did admit it as a motive
 the sooner to effect what i intended
 but god be thanked for prevention
 which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice
 beseeching god and you to pardon me
grey never did faithful subject more rejoice
 at the discovery of most dangerous treason
 than i do at this hour joy o'er myself
 prevented from a damned enterprise
 my fault but not my body pardon sovereign
king henry v god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence
 you have conspired against our royal person
 join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
 received the golden earnest of our death
 wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
 his princes and his peers to servitude
 his subjects to oppression and contempt
 and his whole kingdom into desolation
 touching our person seek we no revenge
 but we our kingdom's safety must so tender
 whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
 we do deliver you get you therefore hence
 poor miserable wretches to your death
 the taste whereof god of his mercy give
 you patience to endure and true repentance
 of all your dear offences bear them hence
 exeunt cambridge scroop and grey guarded
 now lords for france the enterprise whereof
 shall be to you as us like glorious
 we doubt not of a fair and lucky war
 since god so graciously hath brought to light
 this dangerous treason lurking in our way
 to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
 but every rub is smoothed on our way
 then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
 our puissance into the hand of god
 putting it straight in expedition
 cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
 no king of england if not king of france

 flourish enter the french king the dauphin the
 dukes of berri and bretagne the constable and others
king of france thus comes the english with full power upon us
 and more than carefully it us concerns
 to answer royally in our defences
 therefore the dukes of berri and of bretagne
 of brabant and of orleans shall make forth
 and you prince dauphin with all swift dispatch
 to line and new repair our towns of war
 with men of courage and with means defendant
 for england his approaches makes as fierce
 as waters to the sucking of a gulf
 it fits us then to be as provident
 as fear may teach us out of late examples
 left by the fatal and neglected english
 upon our fields
dauphin my most redoubted father
 it is most meet we arm us gainst the foe
 for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
 though war nor no known quarrel were in question
 but that defences musters preparations
 should be maintain'd assembled and collected
 as were a war in expectation
 therefore i say tis meet we all go forth
 to view the sick and feeble parts of france
 and let us do it with no show of fear
 no with no more than if we heard that england
 were busied with a whitsun morrisdance
 for my good liege she is so idly king'd
 her sceptre so fantastically borne
 by a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
 that fear attends her not
constable o peace prince dauphin
 you are too much mistaken in this king
 question your grace the late ambassadors
 with what great state he heard their embassy
 how well supplied with noble counsellors
 how modest in exception and withal
 how terrible in constant resolution
 and you shall find his vanities forespent
 were but the outside of the roman brutus
 covering discretion with a coat of folly
 as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
 that shall first spring and be most delicate
dauphin well tis not so my lord high constable
 but though we think it so it is no matter
 in cases of defence tis best to weigh
 the enemy more mighty than he seems
 so the proportions of defence are fill'd
 which of a weak or niggardly projection
 doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
 a little cloth
king of france think we king harry strong
 and princes look you strongly arm to meet him
 the kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us
 and he is bred out of that bloody strain
 that haunted us in our familiar paths
 witness our too much memorable shame
 when cressy battle fatally was struck
 and all our princes captiv'd by the hand
 of that black name edward black prince of wales
 whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
 up in the air crown'd with the golden sun
 saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him
 mangle the work of nature and deface
 the patterns that by god and by french fathers
 had twenty years been made this is a stem
 of that victorious stock and let us fear
 the native mightiness and fate of him

 most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten

 selflove my liege is not so vile a sin
 as selfneglecting
 reenter lords with exeter and train

 to him and to his heirs namely the crown
 and all widestretched honours that pertain
 by custom and the ordinance of times
 unto the crown of france that you may know
 tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
 pick'd from the wormholes of longvanish'd days
 nor from the dust of old oblivion raked
 he sends you this most memorable line
 in every branch truly demonstrative
 willing to overlook this pedigree
 and when you find him evenly derived
 from his most famed of famous ancestors
 edward the third he bids you then resign
 your crown and kingdom indirectly held
 from him the native and true challenger
king of france or else what follows
exeter bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
 even in your hearts there will he rake for it
 therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
 in thunder and in earthquake like a jove
 that if requiring fail he will compel
 and bids you in the bowels of the lord
 deliver up the crown and to take mercy
 on the poor souls for whom this hungry war
 opens his vasty jaws and on your head
 turning the widows tears the orphans cries
 the dead men's blood the pining maidens groans
 for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
 that shall be swallow'd in this controversy
 this is his claim his threatening and my message
 unless the dauphin be in presence here
 to whom expressly i bring greeting too
king of france for us we will consider of this further
 tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
 back to our brother england
dauphin for the dauphin
 i stand here for him what to him from england
exeter scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
 and any thing that may not misbecome
 the mighty sender doth he prize you at
 thus says my king an if your father's highness
 do not in grant of all demands at large
 sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty
 he'll call you to so hot an answer of it
 that caves and womby vaultages of france
 shall chide your trespass and return your mock
 in second accent of his ordnance
dauphin say if my father render fair return
 it is against my will for i desire
 nothing but odds with england to that end
 as matching to his youth and vanity
 i did present him with the paris balls
exeter he'll make your paris louvre shake for it
 were it the mistresscourt of mighty europe
 and be assured you'll find a difference
 as we his subjects have in wonder found
 between the promise of his greener days
 and these he masters now now he weighs time
 even to the utmost grain that you shall read
 in your own losses if he stay in france
king of france tomorrow shall you know our mind at full
exeter dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
 come here himself to question our delay
 for he is footed in this land already
king of france you shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions
 a night is but small breath and little pause
 to answer matters of this consequence

 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
 in motion of no less celerity
 than that of thought suppose that you have seen
 the wellappointed king at hampton pier
 embark his royalty and his brave fleet
 with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning
 play with your fancies and in them behold
 upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing
 hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
 to sounds confused behold the threaden sails
 borne with the invisible and creeping wind
 draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea
 breasting the lofty surge o do but think
 you stand upon the ravage and behold
 a city on the inconstant billows dancing
 for so appears this fleet majestical
 holding due course to harfleur follow follow
 grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
 and leave your england as dead midnight still
 guarded with grandsires babies and old women
 either past or not arrived to pith and puissance
 for who is he whose chin is but enrich'd
 with one appearing hair that will not follow
 these cull'd and choicedrawn cavaliers to france
 work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
 behold the ordnance on their carriages
 with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur
 suppose the ambassador from the french comes back
 tells harry that the king doth offer him
 katharine his daughter and with her to dowry
 some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
 the offer likes not and the nimble gunner
 with linstock now the devilish cannon touches
 alarum and chambers go off

 or close the wall up with our english dead
 in peace there's nothing so becomes a man

 then imitate the action of the tiger
 stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
 disguise fair nature with hardfavour'd rage
 then lend the eye a terrible aspect
 let pry through the portage of the head
 like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it
 as fearfully as doth a galled rock
 o'erhang and jutty his confounded base
 swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean
 now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
 hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
 to his full height on on you noblest english
 whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof
 fathers that like so many alexanders
 have in these parts from morn till even fought
 and sheathed their swords for lack of argument
 dishonour not your mothers now attest
 that those whom you call'd fathers did beget you
 be copy now to men of grosser blood
 and teach them how to war and you good yeoman
 whose limbs were made in england show us here
 the mettle of your pasture let us swear
 that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not
 for there is none of you so mean and base
 that hath not noble lustre in your eyes

nym pray thee corporal stay the knocks are too hot
 and for mine own part i have not a case of lives
 the humour of it is too hot that is the very
 plainsong of it
pistol the plainsong is most just for humours do abound
 knocks go and come god's vassals drop and die
 and sword and shield
 in bloody field
 doth win immortal fame
boy would i were in an alehouse in london i would give
 all my fame for a pot of ale and safety

 abate thy rage abate thy manly rage
 abate thy rage great duke
 good bawcock bate thy rage use lenity sweet chuck
nym these be good humours your honour wins bad humours
 exeunt all but boy
boy as young as i am i have observed these three
 swashers i am boy to them all three but all they
 three though they would serve me could not be man
 to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to
 a man for bardolph he is whitelivered and
 redfaced by the means whereof a faces it out but
 fights not for pistol he hath a killing tongue
 and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks
 words and keeps whole weapons for nym he hath
 heard that men of few words are the best men and
 therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a'
 should be thought a coward but his few bad words
 are matched with as few good deeds for a never
 broke any man's head but his own and that was
 against a post when he was drunk they will steal
 any thing and call it purchase bardolph stole a
 lutecase bore it twelve leagues and sold it for
 three half pence nym and bardolph are sworn
 brothers in filching and in calais they stole a
 fireshovel i knew by that piece of service the
 men would carry coals they would have me as
 familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
 handkerchers which makes much against my manhood
 if i should take from another's pocket to put into
 mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs i
 must leave them and seek some better service
 their villany goes against my weak stomach and
 therefore i must cast it up

 english forces below enter king henry and his train
king henry v how yet resolves the governor of the town
 this is the latest parle we will admit
 therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
 or like to men proud of destruction
 defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier
 a name that in my thoughts becomes me best
 if i begin the battery once again
 i will not leave the halfachieved harfleur
 till in her ashes she lie buried
 the gates of mercy shall be all shut up
 and the flesh'd soldier rough and hard of heart
 in liberty of bloody hand shall range
 with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass
 your freshfair virgins and your flowering infants
 what is it then to me if impious war
 array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends
 do with his smirch'd complexion all fell feats
 enlink'd to waste and desolation
 what is't to me when you yourselves are cause
 if your pure maidens fall into the hand
 of hot and forcing violation
 what rein can hold licentious wickedness
 when down the hill he holds his fierce career
 we may as bootless spend our vain command
 upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
 as send precepts to the leviathan
 to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur
 take pity of your town and of your people
 whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
 whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
 o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
 of heady murder spoil and villany
 if not why in a moment look to see
 the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
 defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters
 your fathers taken by the silver beards
 and their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls
 your naked infants spitted upon pikes
 whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
 do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry
 at herod's bloodyhunting slaughtermen
 what say you will you yield and this avoid
 or guilty in defence be thus destroy'd
governor our expectation hath this day an end
 the dauphin whom of succors we entreated
 returns us that his powers are yet not ready
 to raise so great a siege therefore great king
 we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
 enter our gates dispose of us and ours
 for we no longer are defensible

king of france tis certain he hath pass'd the river somme
constable and if he be not fought withal my lord
 let us not live in france let us quit all
 and give our vineyards to a barbarous people
dauphin o dieu vivant shall a few sprays of us
 the emptying of our fathers luxury
 our scions put in wild and savage stock
 spirt up so suddenly into the clouds
 and overlook their grafters
bourbon normans but bastard normans norman bastards
 mort de ma vie if they march along
 unfought withal but i will sell my dukedom
 to buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
 in that nookshotten isle of albion
constable dieu de batailles where have they this mettle
 is not their climate foggy raw and dull
 on whom as in despite the sun looks pale
 killing their fruit with frowns can sodden water
 a drench for surrein'd jades their barleybroth
 decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat
 and shall our quick blood spirited with wine
 seem frosty o for honour of our land
 let us not hang like roping icicles
 upon our houses thatch whiles a more frosty people
 sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields
 poor we may call them in their native lords
dauphin by faith and honour
 our madams mock at us and plainly say
 our mettle is bred out and they will give
 their bodies to the lust of english youth
 to newstore france with bastard warriors
bourbon they bid us to the english dancingschools
 and teach lavoltas high and swift corantos
 saying our grace is only in our heels
 and that we are most lofty runaways
king of france where is montjoy the herald speed him hence
 let him greet england with our sharp defiance
 up princes and with spirit of honour edged
 more sharper than your swords hie to the field

 go down upon him you have power enough
 and in a captive chariot into rouen
 bring him our prisoner
constable this becomes the great
 sorry am i his numbers are so few
 his soldiers sick and famish'd in their march
 for i am sure when he shall see our army
 he'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
 and for achievement offer us his ransom
king of france therefore lord constable haste on montjoy
 and let him say to england that we send
 to know what willing ransom he will give
 prince dauphin you shall stay with us in rouen

scene vi the english camp in picardy
 enter gower and fluellen meeting
gower how now captain fluellen come you from the bridge
fluellen i assure you there is very excellent services
 committed at the bridge
gower is the duke of exeter safe
fluellen the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon
 and a man that i love and honour with my soul and my
 heart and my duty and my life and my living and
 my uttermost power he is notgod be praised and
 blessedany hurt in the world but keeps the
 bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline
 there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
 pridge i think in my very conscience he is as
 valiant a man as mark antony and he is a man of no
 estimation in the world but did see him do as
 gallant service
gower what do you call him
fluellen he is called aunchient pistol
gower i know him not
 enter pistol
fluellen here is the man
pistol captain i thee beseech to do me favours
 the duke of exeter doth love thee well
fluellen ay i praise god and i have merited some love at
 his hands
pistol bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
 and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
 and giddy fortune's furious fickle wheel
 that goddess blind
 that stands upon the rolling restless stone
fluellen by your patience aunchient pistol fortune is
 painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to
 signify to you that fortune is blind and she is
 painted also with a wheel to signify to you which
 is the moral of it that she is turning and
 inconstant and mutability and variation and her
 foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone
 which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth
 the poet makes a most excellent description of it
 fortune is an excellent moral
pistol fortune is bardolph's foe and frowns on him
 for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a be
 a damned death
 let gallows gape for dog let man go free
 and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
 but exeter hath given the doom of death
 for pax of little price
 therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice
 and let not bardolph's vital thread be cut
 with edge of penny cord and vile reproach
 speak captain for his life and i will thee requite
fluellen aunchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning
pistol why then rejoice therefore
fluellen certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice
 at for if look you he were my brother i would
 desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put
 him to execution for discipline ought to be used
pistol die and be damn'd and figo for thy friendship
fluellen it is well
pistol the fig of spain
 exit
fluellen very good
gower why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal i
 remember him now a bawd a cutpurse
fluellen i'll assure you a uttered as brave words at the
 bridge as you shall see in a summer's day but it
 is very well what he has spoke to me that is well
 i warrant you when time is serve
gower why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then
 goes to the wars to grace himself at his return
 into london under the form of a soldier and such
 fellows are perfect in the great commanders names
 and they will learn you by rote where services were
 done at such and such a sconce at such a breach
 at such a convoy who came off bravely who was
 shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on
 and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war
 which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what
 a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of
 the camp will do among foaming bottles and
 alewashed wits is wonderful to be thought on but
 you must learn to know such slanders of the age or
 else you may be marvellously mistook
fluellen i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is
 not the man that he would gladly make show to the
 world he is if i find a hole in his coat i will
 tell him my mind
 drum heard
 hark you the king is coming and i must speak with
 him from the pridge
 drum and colours enter king henry gloucester and soldiers
 god pless your majesty
king henry v how now fluellen camest thou from the bridge
fluellen ay so please your majesty the duke of exeter has
 very gallantly maintained the pridge the french is
 gone off look you and there is gallant and most
 prave passages marry th athversary was have
 possession of the pridge but he is enforced to
 retire and the duke of exeter is master of the
 pridge i can tell your majesty the duke is a
 prave man
king henry v what men have you lost fluellen
fluellen the perdition of th athversary hath been very
 great reasonable great marry for my part i
 think the duke hath lost never a man but one that
 is like to be executed for robbing a church one
 bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is
 all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o'
 fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like
 a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red
 but his nose is executed and his fire's out
king henry v we would have all such offenders so cut off and we
 give express charge that in our marches through the
 country there be nothing compelled from the
 villages nothing taken but paid for none of the
 french upbraided or abused in disdainful language
 for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
 gentler gamester is the soonest winner
 tucket enter montjoy
montjoy you know me by my habit
king henry v well then i know thee what shall i know of thee
montjoy my master's mind
king henry v unfold it
montjoy thus says my king say thou to harry of england
 though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage
 is a better soldier than rashness tell him we
 could have rebuked him at harfleur but that we
 thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
 full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice
 is imperial england shall repent his folly see
 his weakness and admire our sufferance bid him
 therefore consider of his ransom which must
 proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we
 have lost the disgrace we have digested which in
 weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under
 for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the
 effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too
 faint a number and for our disgrace his own
 person kneeling at our feet but a weak and
 worthless satisfaction to this add defiance and
 tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
 followers whose condemnation is pronounced so far
 my king and master so much my office
king henry v what is thy name i know thy quality
montjoy montjoy
king henry v thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back
 and tell thy king i do not seek him now
 but could be willing to march on to calais
 without impeachment for to say the sooth
 though tis no wisdom to confess so much
 unto an enemy of craft and vantage
 my people are with sickness much enfeebled
 my numbers lessened and those few i have
 almost no better than so many french
 who when they were in health i tell thee herald
 i thought upon one pair of english legs
 did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god
 that i do brag thus this your air of france
 hath blown that vice in me i must repent
 go therefore tell thy master here i am
 my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
 my army but a weak and sickly guard
 yet god before tell him we will come on
 though france himself and such another neighbour
 stand in our way there's for thy labour montjoy
 go bid thy master well advise himself
 if we may pass we will if we be hinder'd
 we shall your tawny ground with your red blood
 discolour and so montjoy fare you well
 the sum of all our answer is but this
 we would not seek a battle as we are
 nor as we are we say we will not shun it
 so tell your master
montjoy i shall deliver so thanks to your highness
 exit
gloucester i hope they will not come upon us now
king henry v we are in god's hand brother not in theirs
 march to the bridge it now draws toward night
 beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves
 and on tomorrow bid them march away

scene vii the french camp near agincourt
 enter the constable of france the lord rambures
 orleans dauphin with others
constable tut i have the best armour of the world would it were day
orleans you have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due
constable it is the best horse of europe
orleans will it never be morning
dauphin my lord of orleans and my lord high constable you
 talk of horse and armour
orleans you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world
dauphin what a long night is this i will not change my
 horse with any that treads but on four pasterns
 ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his
 entrails were hairs le cheval volant the pegasus
 chez les narines de feu when i bestride him i
 soar i am a hawk he trots the air the earth
 sings when he touches it the basest horn of his
 hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes
orleans he's of the colour of the nutmeg
dauphin and of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for
 perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull
 elements of earth and water never appear in him but
 only in patient stillness while his rider mounts
 him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you
 may call beasts
constable indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse
dauphin it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
 bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
orleans no more cousin
dauphin nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the
 rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary
 deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as
 fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent
 tongues and my horse is argument for them all
 tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for
 a sovereign's sovereign to ride on and for the
 world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
 their particular functions and wonder at him i
 once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus
 wonder of nature'
orleans i have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress
dauphin then did they imitate that which i composed to my
 courser for my horse is my mistress
orleans your mistress bears well
dauphin me well which is the prescript praise and
 perfection of a good and particular mistress
constable nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
 shook your back
dauphin so perhaps did yours
constable mine was not bridled
dauphin o then belike she was old and gentle and you rode
 like a kern of ireland your french hose off and in
 your straight strossers
constable you have good judgment in horsemanship
dauphin be warned by me then they that ride so and ride
 not warily fall into foul bogs i had rather have
 my horse to my mistress
constable i had as lief have my mistress a jade
dauphin i tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair
constable i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow
 to my mistress

 my way shall be paved with english faces
constable i will not say so for fear i should be faced out of

constable doing is activity and he will still be doing
orleans he never did harm that i heard of

orleans i know him to be valiant
constable i was told that by one that knows him better than

messenger the lord grandpre
constable a valiant and most expert gentleman would it were
 day alas poor harry of england he longs not for
 the dawning as we do
orleans what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
 england to mope with his fatbrained followers so
 far out of his knowledge
constable if the english had any apprehension they would run away
orleans that they lack for if their heads had any
 intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy
 headpieces
rambures that island of england breeds very valiant
 creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
orleans foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a
 russian bear and have their heads crushed like
 rotten apples you may as well say that's a
 valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion
constable just just and the men do sympathize with the
 mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving
 their wits with their wives and then give them
 great meals of beef and iron and steel they will
 eat like wolves and fight like devils
orleans ay but these english are shrewdly out of beef
constable then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs
 to eat and none to fight now is it time to arm
 come shall we about it
orleans it is now two o'clock but let me see by ten
 we shall have each a hundred englishmen

act iv
 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus now entertain conjecture of a time
 when creeping murmur and the poring dark
 fills the wide vessel of the universe
 from camp to camp through the foul womb of night
 the hum of either army stilly sounds
 that the fixed sentinels almost receive
 the secret whispers of each other's watch
 fire answers fire and through their paly flames
 each battle sees the other's umber'd face
 steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
 piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents
 the armourers accomplishing the knights
 with busy hammers closing rivets up
 give dreadful note of preparation
 the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll
 and the third hour of drowsy morning name
 proud of their numbers and secure in soul
 the confident and overlusty french
 do the lowrated english play at dice
 and chide the cripple tardygaited night
 who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
 so tediously away the poor condemned english
 like sacrifices by their watchful fires
 sit patiently and inly ruminate
 the morning's danger and their gesture sad
 investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats
 presenteth them unto the gazing moon
 so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold
 the royal captain of this ruin'd band
 walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
 let him cry praise and glory on his head'
 for forth he goes and visits all his host
 bids them good morrow with a modest smile
 and calls them brothers friends and countrymen
 upon his royal face there is no note
 how dread an army hath enrounded him
 nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
 unto the weary and allwatched night
 but freshly looks and overbears attaint
 with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
 that every wretch pining and pale before
 beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
 a largess universal like the sun
 his liberal eye doth give to every one
 thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
 behold as may unworthiness define
 a little touch of harry in the night
 and so our scene must to the battle fly
 whereo for pitywe shall much disgrace
 with four or five most vile and ragged foils
 right illdisposed in brawl ridiculous
 the name of agincourt yet sit and see
 minding true things by what their mockeries be

scene i the english camp at agincourt
 enter king henry bedford and gloucester
king henry v gloucester tis true that we are in great danger
 the greater therefore should our courage be
 good morrow brother bedford god almighty
 there is some soul of goodness in things evil
 would men observingly distil it out
 for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
 which is both healthful and good husbandry
 besides they are our outward consciences
 and preachers to us all admonishing
 that we should dress us fairly for our end
 thus may we gather honey from the weed
 and make a moral of the devil himself
 enter erpingham
 good morrow old sir thomas erpingham
 a good soft pillow for that good white head
 were better than a churlish turf of france
erpingham not so my liege this lodging likes me better

king henry v tis good for men to love their present pains
 upon example so the spirit is eased
 and when the mind is quicken'd out of doubt
 the organs though defunct and dead before
 break up their drowsy grave and newly move
 with casted slough and fresh legerity
 lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both
 commend me to the princes in our camp
 do my good morrow to them and anon
 desire them an to my pavilion

fluellen so in the name of jesu christ speak lower it is
 the greatest admiration of the universal world when
 the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
 wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to
 examine the wars of pompey the great you shall
 find i warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle
 nor pibble pabble in pompey's camp i warrant you
 you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the
 cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety
 of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
gower why the enemy is loud you hear him all night
fluellen if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
 coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also
 look you be an ass and a fool and a prating
 coxcomb in your own conscience now
gower i will speak lower
fluellen i pray you and beseech you that you will
 exeunt gower and fluellen
king henry v though it appear a little out of fashion
 there is much care and valour in this welshman
 enter three soldiers john bates alexander court
 and michael williams
court brother john bates is not that the morning which
 breaks yonder
bates i think it be but we have no great cause to desire
 the approach of day
williams we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think
 we shall never see the end of it who goes there
king henry v a friend
williams under what captain serve you
king henry v under sir thomas erpingham
williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i
 pray you what thinks he of our estate
king henry v even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be
 washed off the next tide
bates he hath not told his thought to the king
king henry v no nor it is not meet he should for though i
 speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i
 am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the
 element shows to him as it doth to me all his
 senses have but human conditions his ceremonies
 laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and
 though his affections are higher mounted than ours
 yet when they stoop they stoop with the like
 wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we
 do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish
 as ours are yet in reason no man should possess
 him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing
 it should dishearten his army
bates he may show what outward courage he will but i
 believe as cold a night as tis he could wish
 himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he
 were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here
king henry v by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king
 i think he would not wish himself any where but
 where he is
bates then i would he were here alone so should he be
 sure to be ransomed and a many poor men's lives saved
king henry v i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
 alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
 minds methinks i could not die any where so
 contented as in the king's company his cause being
 just and his quarrel honourable
williams that's more than we know
bates ay or more than we should seek after for we know
 enough if we know we are the kings subjects if
 his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes
 the crime of it out of us
williams but if the cause be not good the king himself hath
 a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and
 arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join
 together at the latter day and cry all we died at
 such a place some swearing some crying for a
 surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind
 them some upon the debts they owe some upon their
 children rawly left i am afeard there are few die
 well that die in a battle for how can they
 charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their
 argument now if these men do not die well it
 will be a black matter for the king that led them to
 it whom to disobey were against all proportion of
 subjection
king henry v so if a son that is by his father sent about
 merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the
 imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be
 imposed upon his father that sent him or if a
 servant under his master's command transporting a
 sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in
 many irreconciled iniquities you may call the
 business of the master the author of the servant's
 damnation but this is not so the king is not
 bound to answer the particular endings of his
 soldiers the father of his son nor the master of
 his servant for they purpose not their death when
 they purpose their services besides there is no
 king be his cause never so spotless if it come to
 the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all
 unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them
 the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder
 some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
 perjury some making the wars their bulwark that
 have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
 pillage and robbery now if these men have
 defeated the law and outrun native punishment
 though they can outstrip men they have no wings to
 fly from god war is his beadle war is vengeance
 so that here men are punished for beforebreach of
 the king's laws in now the king's quarrel where
 they feared the death they have borne life away
 and where they would be safe they perish then if
 they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of
 their damnation than he was before guilty of those
 impieties for the which they are now visited every
 subject's duty is the king's but every subject's
 soul is his own therefore should every soldier in
 the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every
 mote out of his conscience and dying so death
 is to him advantage or not dying the time was
 blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained
 and in him that escapes it were not sin to think
 that making god so free an offer he let him
 outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach
 others how they should prepare
williams tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon
 his own head the king is not to answer it
bates but i do not desire he should answer for me and
 yet i determine to fight lustily for him
king henry v i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed
williams ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but
 when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we
 ne'er the wiser
king henry v if i live to see it i will never trust his word after
williams you pay him then that's a perilous shot out of an
 eldergun that a poor and private displeasure can
 do against a monarch you may as well go about to
 turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
 peacock's feather you'll never trust his word
 after come tis a foolish saying
king henry v your reproof is something too round i should be
 angry with you if the time were convenient
williams let it be a quarrel between us if you live
king henry v i embrace it
williams how shall i know thee again
king henry v give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my
 bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it i
 will make it my quarrel
williams here's my glove give me another of thine
king henry v there
williams this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come
 to me and say after tomorrow this is my glove'
 by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear
king henry v if ever i live to see it i will challenge it
williams thou darest as well be hanged
king henry v well i will do it though i take thee in the
 king's company
williams keep thy word fare thee well
bates be friends you english fools be friends we have
 french quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon
king henry v indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to
 one they will beat us for they bear them on their
 shoulders but it is no english treason to cut
 french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will
 be a clipper
 exeunt soldiers
 upon the king let us our lives our souls
 our debts our careful wives
 our children and our sins lay on the king
 we must bear all o hard condition
 twinborn with greatness subject to the breath
 of every fool whose sense no more can feel
 but his own wringing what infinite heart'sease
 must kings neglect that private men enjoy
 and what have kings that privates have not too
 save ceremony save general ceremony
 and what art thou thou idle ceremony
 what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more
 of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
 what are thy rents what are thy comings in
 o ceremony show me but thy worth
 what is thy soul of adoration
 art thou aught else but place degree and form
 creating awe and fear in other men
 wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
 than they in fearing
 what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet
 but poison'd flattery o be sick great greatness
 and bid thy ceremony give thee cure
 think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
 with titles blown from adulation
 will it give place to flexure and low bending
 canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee
 command the health of it no thou proud dream
 that play'st so subtly with a king's repose
 i am a king that find thee and i know
 tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
 the sword the mace the crown imperial
 the intertissued robe of gold and pearl
 the farced title running fore the king
 the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
 that beats upon the high shore of this world
 no not all these thricegorgeous ceremony
 not all these laid in bed majestical
 can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
 who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
 gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread
 never sees horrid night the child of hell
 but like a lackey from the rise to set
 sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night
 sleeps in elysium next day after dawn
 doth rise and help hyperion to his horse
 and follows so the everrunning year
 with profitable labour to his grave
 and but for ceremony such a wretch
 winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
 had the forehand and vantage of a king
 the slave a member of the country's peace
 enjoys it but in gross brain little wots

 enter messenger
messenger the english are embattled you french peers
constable to horse you gallant princes straight to horse

 there is not work enough for all our hands
 scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
 to give each naked curtleaxe a stain
 that our french gallants shall today draw out
 and sheathe for lack of sport let us but blow on them
 the vapour of our valour will o'erturn them
 tis positive gainst all exceptions lords
 that our superfluous lackeys and our peasants
 who in unnecessary action swarm
 about our squares of battle were enow
 to purge this field of such a hilding foe
 though we upon this mountain's basis by
 took stand for idle speculation
 but that our honours must not what's to say
 a very little little let us do

 yon island carrions desperate of their bones
 illfavouredly become the morning field
 their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
 and our air shakes them passing scornfully
 big mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
 and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
 the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
 with torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades
 lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
 the gum downroping from their paledead eyes
 and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
 lies foul with chew'd grass still and motionless
 and their executors the knavish crows
 fly o'er them all impatient for their hour
 description cannot suit itself in words
 to demonstrate the life of such a battle
 in life so lifeless as it shows itself
constable they have said their prayers and they stay for death
dauphin shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
 and give their fasting horses provender

westmoreland of fighting men they have full three score thousand
exeter there's five to one besides they all are fresh
salisbury god's arm strike with us tis a fearful odds
 god be wi you princes all i'll to my charge
 if we no more meet till we meet in heaven
 then joyfully my noble lord of bedford
 my dear lord gloucester and my good lord exeter
 and my kind kinsman warriors all adieu
bedford farewell good salisbury and good luck go with thee
exeter farewell kind lord fight valiantly today

 enter the king
westmoreland o that we now had here
 but one ten thousand of those men in england
 that do no work today
king henry v what's he that wishes so
 my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin
 if we are mark'd to die we are enow
 to do our country loss and if to live
 the fewer men the greater share of honour
 god's will i pray thee wish not one man more
 by jove i am not covetous for gold
 nor care i who doth feed upon my cost
 it yearns me not if men my garments wear
 such outward things dwell not in my desires
 but if it be a sin to covet honour
 i am the most offending soul alive
 no faith my coz wish not a man from england
 god's peace i would not lose so great an honour
 as one man more methinks would share from me
 for the best hope i have o do not wish one more
 rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host
 that he which hath no stomach to this fight
 let him depart his passport shall be made
 and crowns for convoy put into his purse
 we would not die in that man's company
 that fears his fellowship to die with us
 this day is called the feast of crispian
 he that outlives this day and comes safe home
 will stand a tiptoe when the day is named
 and rouse him at the name of crispian
 he that shall live this day and see old age
 will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
 and say tomorrow is saint crispian'
 then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
 and say these wounds i had on crispin's day'
 old men forget yet all shall be forgot
 but he'll remember with advantages
 what feats he did that day then shall our names
 familiar in his mouth as household words
 harry the king bedford and exeter
 warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester
 be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd
 this story shall the good man teach his son
 and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by
 from this day to the ending of the world
 but we in it shall be remember'd
 we few we happy few we band of brothers
 for he today that sheds his blood with me
 shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile
 this day shall gentle his condition
 and gentlemen in england now abed
 shall think themselves accursed they were not here
 and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
 that fought with us upon saint crispin's day
 reenter salisbury
salisbury my sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
 the french are bravely in their battles set
 and will with all expedience charge on us
king henry v all things are ready if our minds be so
westmoreland perish the man whose mind is backward now
king henry v thou dost not wish more help from england coz
westmoreland god's will my liege would you and i alone
 without more help could fight this royal battle
king henry v why now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men
 which likes me better than to wish us one
 you know your places god be with you all
 tucket enter montjoy
montjoy once more i come to know of thee king harry
 if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
 before thy most assured overthrow
 for certainly thou art so near the gulf
 thou needs must be englutted besides in mercy
 the constable desires thee thou wilt mind
 thy followers of repentance that their souls
 may make a peaceful and a sweet retire
 from off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
 must lie and fester
king henry v who hath sent thee now
montjoy the constable of france
king henry v i pray thee bear my former answer back
 bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
 good god why should they mock poor fellows thus
 the man that once did sell the lion's skin
 while the beast lived was killed with hunting him
 a many of our bodies shall no doubt
 find native graves upon the which i trust
 shall witness live in brass of this day's work
 and those that leave their valiant bones in france
 dying like men though buried in your dunghills
 they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them
 and draw their honours reeking up to heaven
 leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
 the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france
 mark then abounding valour in our english
 that being dead like to the bullet's grazing
 break out into a second course of mischief
 killing in relapse of mortality
 let me speak proudly tell the constable
 we are but warriors for the workingday
 our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
 with rainy marching in the painful field
 there's not a piece of feather in our host
 good argument i hope we will not fly
 and time hath worn us into slovenry
 but by the mass our hearts are in the trim
 and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
 they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
 the gay new coats o'er the french soldiers heads
 and turn them out of service if they do this
 as if god please they shallmy ransom then
 will soon be levied herald save thou thy labour
 come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
 they shall have none i swear but these my joints
 which if they have as i will leave em them
 shall yield them little tell the constable
montjoy i shall king harry and so fare thee well
 thou never shalt hear herald any more

exeter in which array brave soldier doth he lie
 larding the plain and by his bloody side
 yokefellow to his honourowing wounds
 the noble earl of suffolk also lies
 suffolk first died and york all haggled over
 comes to him where in gore he lay insteep'd
 and takes him by the beard kisses the gashes
 that bloodily did spawn upon his face
 and cries aloud tarry dear cousin suffolk
 my soul shall thine keep company to heaven
 tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast
 as in this glorious and wellfoughten field
 we kept together in our chivalry'
 upon these words i came and cheer'd him up
 he smiled me in the face raught me his hand
 and with a feeble gripe says dear my lord
 commend my service to me sovereign'
 so did he turn and over suffolk's neck
 he threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips
 and so espoused to death with blood he seal'd
 a testament of nobleending love
 the pretty and sweet manner of it forced
 those waters from me which i would have stopp'd
 but i had not so much of man in me

chorus vouchsafe to those that have not read the story
 that i may prompt them and of such as have
 i humbly pray them to admit the excuse
 of time of numbers and due course of things
 which cannot in their huge and proper life
 be here presented now we bear the king
 toward calais grant him there there seen
 heave him away upon your winged thoughts
 athwart the sea behold the english beach
 pales in the flood with men with wives and boys
 whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouth'd sea
 which like a mighty whiffler fore the king
 seems to prepare his way so let him land
 and solemnly see him set on to london
 so swift a pace hath thought that even now
 you may imagine him upon blackheath
 where that his lords desire him to have borne
 his bruised helmet and his bended sword
 before him through the city he forbids it
 being free from vainness and selfglorious pride
 giving full trophy signal and ostent
 quite from himself to god but now behold
 in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought
 how london doth pour out her citizens
 the mayor and all his brethren in best sort
 like to the senators of the antique rome
 with the plebeians swarming at their heels
 go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in
 as by a lower but loving likelihood
 were now the general of our gracious empress
 as in good time he may from ireland coming
 bringing rebellion broached on his sword
 how many would the peaceful city quit
 to welcome him much more and much more cause
 did they this harry now in london place him
 as yet the lamentation of the french
 invites the king of england's stay at home
 the emperor's coming in behalf of france
 to order peace between them and omit
 all the occurrences whatever chanced
 till harry's backreturn again to france
 there must we bring him and myself have play'd
 the interim by remembering you tis past
 then brook abridgment and your eyes advance
 after your thoughts straight back again to france

 most worthy brother england fairly met

queen isabel so happy be the issue brother england
 of this good day and of this gracious meeting
 as we are now glad to behold your eyes
 your eyes which hitherto have borne in them
 against the french that met them in their bent
 the fatal balls of murdering basilisks
 the venom of such looks we fairly hope
 have lost their quality and that this day
 shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
king henry v to cry amen to that thus we appear
queen isabel you english princes all i do salute you
burgundy my duty to you both on equal love
 great kings of france and england that i have labour'd
 with all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
 to bring your most imperial majesties
 unto this bar and royal interview
 your mightiness on both parts best can witness
 since then my office hath so far prevail'd
 that face to face and royal eye to eye
 you have congreeted let it not disgrace me
 if i demand before this royal view
 what rub or what impediment there is
 why that the naked poor and mangled peace
 dear nurse of arts and joyful births
 should not in this best garden of the world
 our fertile france put up her lovely visage
 alas she hath from france too long been chased
 and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
 corrupting in its own fertility
 her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
 unpruned dies her hedges evenpleach'd
 like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
 put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas
 the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
 doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
 that should deracinate such savagery
 the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
 the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
 wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
 conceives by idleness and nothing teems
 but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
 losing both beauty and utility
 and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
 defective in their natures grow to wildness
 even so our houses and ourselves and children
 have lost or do not learn for want of time
 the sciences that should become our country
 but grow like savagesas soldiers will
 that nothing do but meditate on blood
 to swearing and stern looks diffused attire
 and every thing that seems unnatural
 which to reduce into our former favour
 you are assembled and my speech entreats
 that i may know the let why gentle peace
 should not expel these inconveniences
 and bless us with her former qualities
king henry v if duke of burgundy you would the peace
 whose want gives growth to the imperfections
 which you have cited you must buy that peace
 with full accord to all our just demands
 whose tenors and particular effects
 you have enscheduled briefly in your hands
burgundy the king hath heard them to the which as yet
 there is no answer made
king henry v well then the peace
 which you before so urged lies in his answer
king of france i have but with a cursorary eye
 o'erglanced the articles pleaseth your grace
 to appoint some of your council presently
 to sit with us once more with better heed
 to resurvey them we will suddenly
 pass our accept and peremptory answer
king henry v brother we shall go uncle exeter
 and brother clarence and you brother gloucester
 warwick and huntingdon go with the king
 and take with you free power to ratify
 augment or alter as your wisdoms best
 shall see advantageable for our dignity
 any thing in or out of our demands
 and we'll consign thereto will you fair sister
 go with the princes or stay here with us
queen isabel our gracious brother i will go with them
 haply a woman's voice may do some good
 when articles too nicely urged be stood on
king henry v yet leave our cousin katharine here with us
 she is our capital demand comprised
 within the forerank of our articles
queen isabel she hath good leave
 exeunt all except henry katharine and alice
king henry v fair katharine and most fair
 will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
 such as will enter at a lady's ear
 and plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart
katharine your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england
king henry v o fair katharine if you will love me soundly with
 your french heart i will be glad to hear you
 confess it brokenly with your english tongue do
 you like me kate
katharine pardonnezmoi i cannot tell vat is like me'
king henry v an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel
katharine que ditil que je suis semblable a les anges
alice oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi ditil
king henry v i said so dear katharine and i must not blush to
 affirm it
katharine o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
 tromperies
king henry v what says she fair one that the tongues of men
 are full of deceits
alice oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
 deceits dat is de princess
king henry v the princess is the better englishwoman i faith
 kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am
 glad thou canst speak no better english for if
 thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king
 that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my
 crown i know no ways to mince it in love but
 directly to say i love you then if you urge me
 farther than to say do you in faith i wear out
 my suit give me your answer i faith do and so
 clap hands and a bargain how say you lady
katharine sauf votre honneur me understand vell
king henry v marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for
 your sake kate why you undid me for the one i
 have neither words nor measure and for the other i
 have no strength in measure yet a reasonable
 measure in strength if i could win a lady at
 leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my
 armour on my back under the correction of bragging
 be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife
 or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse
 for her favours i could lay on like a butcher and
 sit like a jackanapes never off but before god
 kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
 eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation
 only downright oaths which i never use till urged
 nor never break for urging if thou canst love a
 fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth
 sunburning that never looks in his glass for love
 of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy
 cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst
 love me for this take me if not to say to thee
 that i shall die is true but for thy love by the
 lord no yet i love thee too and while thou
 livest dear kate take a fellow of plain and
 uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee
 right because he hath not the gift to woo in other
 places for these fellows of infinite tongue that
 can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do
 always reason themselves out again what a
 speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a
 good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a
 black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow
 bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax
 hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the
 moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it
 shines bright and never changes but keeps his
 course truly if thou would have such a one take
 me and take me take a soldier take a soldier
 take a king and what sayest thou then to my love
 speak my fair and fairly i pray thee
katharine is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france
king henry v no it is not possible you should love the enemy of

alice dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
 francei cannot tell vat is baiser en anglish
king henry v to kiss
alice your majesty entendre bettre que moi
king henry v it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss
 before they are married would she say
alice oui vraiment
king henry v o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear
 kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak
 list of a country's fashion we are the makers of
 manners kate and the liberty that follows our
 places stops the mouth of all findfaults as i will
 do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your
 country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently
 and yielding
 kissing her
 you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is
 more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
 tongues of the french council and they should
 sooner persuade harry of england than a general
 petition of monarchs here comes your father
 reenter the french king and his queen burgundy
 and other lords
burgundy god save your majesty my royal cousin teach you
 our princess english
king henry v i would have her learn my fair cousin how
 perfectly i love her and that is good english
burgundy is she not apt
king henry v our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
 smooth so that having neither the voice nor the
 heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up
 the spirit of love in her that he will appear in
 his true likeness
burgundy pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you
 for that if you would conjure in her you must
 make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true
 likeness he must appear naked and blind can you
 blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the
 virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the
 appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
 self it were my lord a hard condition for a maid
 to consign to
king henry v yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces
burgundy they are then excused my lord when they see not
 what they do
king henry v then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking
burgundy i will wink on her to consent my lord if you will
 teach her to know my meaning for maids well
 summered and warm kept are like flies at
 bartholomewtide blind though they have their
 eyes and then they will endure handling which
 before would not abide looking on
king henry v this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer
 and so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the
 latter end and she must be blind too
burgundy as love is my lord before it loves
king henry v it is so and you may some of you thank love for
 my blindness who cannot see many a fair french city
 for one fair french maid that stands in my way
french king yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities
 turned into a maid for they are all girdled with
 maiden walls that war hath never entered
king henry v shall kate be my wife
french king so please you
king henry v i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may
 wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for
 my wish shall show me the way to my will
french king we have consented to all terms of reason
king henry v is't so my lords of england
westmoreland the king hath granted every article
 his daughter first and then in sequel all
 according to their firm proposed natures
exeter only he hath not yet subscribed this
 where your majesty demands that the king of france
 having any occasion to write for matter of grant
 shall name your highness in this form and with this
 addition in french notre trescher fils henri roi
 d'angleterre heritier de france and thus in
 latin praeclarissimus filius noster henricus rex
 angliae et haeres franciae
french king nor this i have not brother so denied
 but your request shall make me let it pass
king henry v i pray you then in love and dear alliance
 let that one article rank with the rest
 and thereupon give me your daughter
french king take her fair son and from her blood raise up
 issue to me that the contending kingdoms
 of france and england whose very shores look pale
 with envy of each other's happiness
 may cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
 plant neighbourhood and christianlike accord
 in their sweet bosoms that never war advance
 his bleeding sword twixt england and fair france
all amen
king henry v now welcome kate and bear me witness all
 that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen
 flourish
queen isabel god the best maker of all marriages
 combine your hearts in one your realms in one
 as man and wife being two are one in love
 so be there twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
 that never may ill office or fell jealousy
 which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage
 thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms
 to make divorce of their incorporate league
 that english may as french french englishmen
 receive each other god speak this amen
all amen
king henry v prepare we for our marriageon which day
 my lord of burgundy we'll take your oath
 and all the peers for surety of our leagues
 then shall i swear to kate and you to me
 and may our oaths well kept and prosperous be

 the prologue
 i come no more to make you laugh things now
 that bear a weighty and a serious brow
 sad high and working full of state and woe
 such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow
 we now present those that can pity here
 may if they think it well let fall a tear
 the subject will deserve it such as give
 their money out of hope they may believe
 may here find truth too those that come to see
 only a show or two and so agree
 the play may pass if they be still and willing
 i'll undertake may see away their shilling
 richly in two short hours only they
 that come to hear a merry bawdy play
 a noise of targets or to see a fellow
 in a long motley coat guarded with yellow
 will be deceived for gentle hearers know
 to rank our chosen truth with such a show
 as fool and fight is beside forfeiting
 our own brains and the opinion that we bring
 to make that only true we now intend
 will leave us never an understanding friend
 therefore for goodness sake and as you are known
 the first and happiest hearers of the town
 be sad as we would make ye think ye see
 the very persons of our noble story
 as they were living think you see them great
 and follow'd with the general throng and sweat
 of thousand friends then in a moment see
 how soon this mightiness meets misery
 and if you can be merry then i'll say
 a man may weep upon his weddingday
 king henry viii
act i
scene i london an antechamber in the palace
 enter norfolk at one door at the other buckingham
 and abergavenny
buckingham good morrow and well met how have ye done
 since last we saw in france
norfolk i thank your grace
 healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
 of what i saw there
buckingham an untimely ague
 stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
 those suns of glory those two lights of men
 met in the vale of andren
norfolk twixt guynes and arde
 i was then present saw them salute on horseback
 beheld them when they lighted how they clung
 in their embracement as they grew together
 which had they what four throned ones could have weigh'd
 such a compounded one
buckingham all the whole time
 i was my chamber's prisoner
norfolk then you lost
 the view of earthly glory men might say
 till this time pomp was single but now married
 to one above itself each following day
 became the next day's master till the last
 made former wonders its today the french
 all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
 shone down the english and tomorrow they
 made britain india every man that stood
 show'd like a mine their dwarfish pages were
 as cherubins all guilt the madams too
 not used to toil did almost sweat to bear
 the pride upon them that their very labour
 was to them as a painting now this masque
 was cried incomparable and the ensuing night
 made it a fool and beggar the two kings
 equal in lustre were now best now worst
 as presence did present them him in eye
 still him in praise and being present both
 twas said they saw but one and no discerner
 durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns
 for so they phrase emby their heralds challenged
 the noble spirits to arms they did perform
 beyond thought's compass that former fabulous story
 being now seen possible enough got credit
 that bevis was believed
buckingham o you go far
norfolk as i belong to worship and affect
 in honour honesty the tract of every thing
 would by a good discourser lose some life
 which action's self was tongue to all was royal
 to the disposing of it nought rebell'd
 order gave each thing view the office did
 distinctly his full function
buckingham who did guide
 i mean who set the body and the limbs
 of this great sport together as you guess
norfolk one certes that promises no element
 in such a business
buckingham i pray you who my lord
norfolk all this was order'd by the good discretion
 of the right reverend cardinal of york
buckingham the devil speed him no man's pie is freed
 from his ambitious finger what had he
 to do in these fierce vanities i wonder
 that such a keech can with his very bulk
 take up the rays o the beneficial sun
 and keep it from the earth
norfolk surely sir
 there's in him stuff that puts him to these ends
 for being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace
 chalks successors their way nor call'd upon
 for high feats done to the crown neither allied
 for eminent assistants but spiderlike
 out of his selfdrawing web he gives us note
 the force of his own merit makes his way
 a gift that heaven gives for him which buys
 a place next to the king
abergavenny i cannot tell
 what heaven hath given himlet some graver eye
 pierce into that but i can see his pride
 peep through each part of him whence has he that
 if not from hell the devil is a niggard
 or has given all before and he begins
 a new hell in himself
buckingham why the devil
 upon this french going out took he upon him
 without the privity o the king to appoint
 who should attend on him he makes up the file
 of all the gentry for the most part such
 to whom as great a charge as little honour
 he meant to lay upon and his own letter
 the honourable board of council out
 must fetch him in the papers
abergavenny i do know
 kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
 by this so sickened their estates that never
 they shall abound as formerly
buckingham o many
 have broke their backs with laying manors on em
 for this great journey what did this vanity
 but minister communication of
 a most poor issue
norfolk grievingly i think
 the peace between the french and us not values
 the cost that did conclude it
buckingham every man
 after the hideous storm that follow'd was
 a thing inspired and not consulting broke
 into a general prophecy that this tempest
 dashing the garment of this peace aboded
 the sudden breach on't
norfolk which is budded out
 for france hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd
 our merchants goods at bourdeaux
abergavenny is it therefore
 the ambassador is silenced
norfolk marry is't
abergavenny a proper title of a peace and purchased
 at a superfluous rate
buckingham why all this business
 our reverend cardinal carried
norfolk like it your grace
 the state takes notice of the private difference
 betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you
 and take it from a heart that wishes towards you
 honour and plenteous safetythat you read
 the cardinal's malice and his potency
 together to consider further that
 what his high hatred would effect wants not
 a minister in his power you know his nature
 that he's revengeful and i know his sword
 hath a sharp edge it's long and t may be said
 it reaches far and where twill not extend
 thither he darts it bosom up my counsel
 you'll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock
 that i advise your shunning
 enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him
 certain of the guard and two secretaries with
 papers cardinal wolsey in his passage fixeth his
 eye on buckingham and buckingham on him both full
 of disdain
cardinal wolsey the duke of buckingham's surveyor ha
 where's his examination
first secretary here so please you
cardinal wolsey is he in person ready
first secretary ay please your grace
cardinal wolsey well we shall then know more and buckingham
 shall lessen this big look
 exeunt cardinal wolsey and his train
buckingham this butcher's cur is venommouth'd and i
 have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
 not wake him in his slumber a beggar's book
 outworths a noble's blood
norfolk what are you chafed
 ask god for temperance that's the appliance only
 which your disease requires
buckingham i read in's looks
 matter against me and his eye reviled
 me as his abject object at this instant
 he bores me with some trick he's gone to the king
 i'll follow and outstare him
norfolk stay my lord
 and let your reason with your choler question
 what tis you go about to climb steep hills
 requires slow pace at first anger is like
 a fullhot horse who being allow'd his way
 selfmettle tires him not a man in england
 can advise me like you be to yourself
 as you would to your friend
buckingham i'll to the king
 and from a mouth of honour quite cry down
 this ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim
 there's difference in no persons
norfolk be advised
 heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
 that it do singe yourself we may outrun
 by violent swiftness that which we run at
 and lose by overrunning know you not
 the fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er
 in seeming to augment it wastes it be advised
 i say again there is no english soul
 more stronger to direct you than yourself
 if with the sap of reason you would quench
 or but allay the fire of passion
buckingham sir
 i am thankful to you and i'll go along
 by your prescription but this topproud fellow
 whom from the flow of gall i name not but
 from sincere motions by intelligence
 and proofs as clear as founts in july when
 we see each grain of gravel i do know
 to be corrupt and treasonous
norfolk say not treasonous'
buckingham to the king i'll say't and make my vouch as strong
 as shore of rock attend this holy fox
 or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravenous
 as he is subtle and as prone to mischief
 as able to perform't his mind and place
 infecting one another yea reciprocally
 only to show his pomp as well in france
 as here at home suggests the king our master
 to this last costly treaty the interview
 that swallow'd so much treasure and like a glass
 did break i the rinsing
norfolk faith and so it did
buckingham pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal
 the articles o the combination drew
 as himself pleased and they were ratified
 as he cried thus let be to as much end
 as give a crutch to the dead but our countcardinal
 has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey
 who cannot err he did it now this follows
 which as i take it is a kind of puppy
 to the old dam treasoncharles the emperor
 under pretence to see the queen his aunt
 for twas indeed his colour but he came
 to whisper wolseyhere makes visitation
 his fears were that the interview betwixt
 england and france might through their amity
 breed him some prejudice for from this league
 peep'd harms that menaced him he privily
 deals with our cardinal and as i trow
 which i do well for i am sure the emperor
 paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted
 ere it was ask'd but when the way was made
 and paved with gold the emperor thus desired
 that he would please to alter the king's course
 and break the foresaid peace let the king know
 as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal
 does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
 and for his own advantage
norfolk i am sorry
 to hear this of him and could wish he were
 something mistaken in't
buckingham no not a syllable
 i do pronounce him in that very shape
 he shall appear in proof
 enter brandon a sergeantatarms before him and
 two or three of the guard
brandon your office sergeant execute it
sergeant sir
 my lord the duke of buckingham and earl
 of hereford stafford and northampton i
 arrest thee of high treason in the name
 of our most sovereign king
buckingham lo you my lord
 the net has fall'n upon me i shall perish
 under device and practise
brandon i am sorry
 to see you ta'en from liberty to look on
 the business present tis his highness pleasure
 you shall to the tower
buckingham it will help me nothing
 to plead mine innocence for that dye is on me
 which makes my whitest part black the will of heaven
 be done in this and all things i obey
 o my lord abergavenny fare you well
brandon nay he must bear you company the king
 to abergavenny
 is pleased you shall to the tower till you know
 how he determines further
abergavenny as the duke said
 the will of heaven be done and the king's pleasure
 by me obey'd
brandon here is a warrant from
 the king to attach lord montacute and the bodies
 of the duke's confessor john de la car
 one gilbert peck his chancellor
buckingham so so
 these are the limbs o the plot no more i hope
brandon a monk o the chartreux
buckingham o nicholas hopkins
brandon he
buckingham my surveyor is false the o'ergreat cardinal
 hath show'd him gold my life is spann'd already

scene ii the same the councilchamber
 cornets enter king henry viii leaning on
 cardinal wolsey's shoulder the nobles and lovell
 cardinal wolsey places himself under king henry
 viii's feet on his right side
king henry viii my life itself and the best heart of it
 thanks you for this great care i stood i the level
 of a fullcharged confederacy and give thanks
 to you that choked it let be call'd before us
 that gentleman of buckingham's in person
 i'll hear him his confessions justify
 and point by point the treasons of his master
 he shall again relate
 a noise within crying room for the queen enter
 queen katharine ushered by norfolk and suffolk
 she kneels king henry viii riseth from his state
 takes her up kisses and placeth her by him
queen katharine nay we must longer kneel i am a suitor
king henry viii arise and take place by us half your suit
 never name to us you have half our power
 the other moiety ere you ask is given
 repeat your will and take it
queen katharine thank your majesty
 that you would love yourself and in that love
 not unconsider'd leave your honour nor
 the dignity of your office is the point
 of my petition
king henry viii lady mine proceed
queen katharine i am solicited not by a few
 and those of true condition that your subjects
 are in great grievance there have been commissions
 sent down among em which hath flaw'd the heart
 of all their loyalties wherein although
 my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches
 most bitterly on you as putter on
 of these exactions yet the king our master
 whose honour heaven shield from soileven he
 escapes not
 language unmannerly yea such which breaks
 the sides of loyalty and almost appears
 in loud rebellion
norfolk not almost appears
 it doth appear for upon these taxations
 the clothiers all not able to maintain
 the many to them longing have put off
 the spinsters carders fullers weavers who
 unfit for other life compell'd by hunger
 and lack of other means in desperate manner
 daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar
 and danger serves among then
king henry viii taxation
 wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal
 you that are blamed for it alike with us
 know you of this taxation
cardinal wolsey please you sir
 i know but of a single part in aught
 pertains to the state and front but in that file
 where others tell steps with me
queen katharine no my lord
 you know no more than others but you frame
 things that are known alike which are not wholesome
 to those which would not know them and yet must
 perforce be their acquaintance these exactions
 whereof my sovereign would have note they are
 most pestilent to the bearing and to bear em
 the back is sacrifice to the load they say
 they are devised by you or else you suffer
 too hard an exclamation
king henry viii still exaction
 the nature of it in what kind let's know
 is this exaction
queen katharine i am much too venturous
 in tempting of your patience but am bolden'd
 under your promised pardon the subjects grief
 comes through commissions which compel from each
 the sixth part of his substance to be levied
 without delay and the pretence for this
 is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths
 tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
 allegiance in them their curses now
 live where their prayers did and it's come to pass
 this tractable obedience is a slave
 to each incensed will i would your highness
 would give it quick consideration for
 there is no primer business
king henry viii by my life
 this is against our pleasure
cardinal wolsey and for me
 i have no further gone in this than by
 a single voice and that not pass'd me but
 by learned approbation of the judges if i am
 traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know
 my faculties nor person yet will be
 the chronicles of my doing let me say
 tis but the fate of place and the rough brake
 that virtue must go through we must not stint
 our necessary actions in the fear
 to cope malicious censurers which ever
 as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow
 that is newtrimm'd but benefit no further
 than vainly longing what we oft do best
 by sick interpreters once weak ones is
 not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft
 hitting a grosser quality is cried up
 for our best act if we shall stand still
 in fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at
 we should take root here where we sit or sit
 statestatues only
king henry viii things done well
 and with a care exempt themselves from fear
 things done without example in their issue
 are to be fear'd have you a precedent
 of this commission i believe not any
 we must not rend our subjects from our laws
 and stick them in our will sixth part of each
 a trembling contribution why we take
 from every tree lop bark and part o the timber
 and though we leave it with a root thus hack'd
 the air will drink the sap to every county
 where this is question'd send our letters with
 free pardon to each man that has denied
 the force of this commission pray look to't
 i put it to your care
cardinal wolsey a word with you
 to the secretary
 let there be letters writ to every shire
 of the king's grace and pardon the grieved commons
 hardly conceive of me let it be noised
 that through our intercession this revokement
 and pardon comes i shall anon advise you
 further in the proceeding
 exit secretary
 enter surveyor
queen katharine i am sorry that the duke of buckingham
 is run in your displeasure
king henry viii it grieves many
 the gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker
 to nature none more bound his training such
 that he may furnish and instruct great teachers
 and never seek for aid out of himself yet see
 when these so noble benefits shall prove
 not well disposed the mind growing once corrupt
 they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
 than ever they were fair this man so complete
 who was enroll'd mongst wonders and when we
 almost with ravish'd listening could not find
 his hour of speech a minute he my lady
 hath into monstrous habits put the graces
 that once were his and is become as black
 as if besmear'd in hell sit by us you shall hear
 this was his gentleman in trustof him
 things to strike honour sad bid him recount
 the forerecited practises whereof
 we cannot feel too little hear too much
cardinal wolsey stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
 most like a careful subject have collected
 out of the duke of buckingham
king henry viii speak freely
surveyor first it was usual with him every day
 it would infect his speech that if the king
 should without issue die he'll carry it so
 to make the sceptre his these very words
 i've heard him utter to his soninlaw
 lord abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced
 revenge upon the cardinal
cardinal wolsey please your highness note
 this dangerous conception in this point
 not friended by by his wish to your high person
 his will is most malignant and it stretches
 beyond you to your friends
queen katharine my learn'd lord cardinal
 deliver all with charity
king henry viii speak on
 how grounded he his title to the crown
 upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him
 at any time speak aught
surveyor he was brought to this
 by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins
king henry viii what was that hopkins
surveyor sir a chartreux friar
 his confessor who fed him every minute
 with words of sovereignty
king henry viii how know'st thou this
surveyor not long before your highness sped to france
 the duke being at the rose within the parish
 saint lawrence poultney did of me demand
 what was the speech among the londoners
 concerning the french journey i replied
 men fear'd the french would prove perfidious
 to the king's danger presently the duke
 said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
 twould prove the verity of certain words
 spoke by a holy monk that oft says he
 hath sent to me wishing me to permit
 john de la car my chaplain a choice hour
 to hear from him a matter of some moment
 whom after under the confession's seal
 he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
 my chaplain to no creature living but
 to me should utter with demure confidence
 this pausingly ensued neither the king nor's heirs
 tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive
 to gain the love o the commonalty the duke
 shall govern england'
queen katharine if i know you well
 you were the duke's surveyor and lost your office
 on the complaint o the tenants take good heed
 you charge not in your spleen a noble person
 and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed
 yes heartily beseech you
king henry viii let him on
 go forward
surveyor on my soul i'll speak but truth
 i told my lord the duke by the devil's illusions
 the monk might be deceived and that twas dangerous for him
 to ruminate on this so far until
 it forged him some design which being believed
 it was much like to do he answer'd tush
 it can do me no damage adding further
 that had the king in his last sickness fail'd
 the cardinal's and sir thomas lovell's heads
 should have gone off
king henry viii ha what so rank ah ha
 there's mischief in this man canst thou say further
surveyor i can my liege
king henry viii proceed
surveyor being at greenwich
 after your highness had reproved the duke
 about sir william blomer
king henry viii i remember
 of such a time being my sworn servant
 the duke retain'd him his but on what hence
surveyor if quoth he i for this had been committed
 as to the tower i thought i would have play'd
 the part my father meant to act upon
 the usurper richard who being at salisbury
 made suit to come in's presence which if granted
 as he made semblance of his duty would
 have put his knife to him'
king henry viii a giant traitor
cardinal wolsey now madam may his highness live in freedom
 and this man out of prison
queen katharine god mend all
king henry viii there's something more would out of thee what say'st
surveyor after the duke his father with the knife'
 he stretch'd him and with one hand on his dagger
 another spread on's breast mounting his eyes
 he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor
 waswere he evil used he would outgo
 his father by as much as a performance
 does an irresolute purpose
king henry viii there's his period
 to sheathe his knife in us he is attach'd
 call him to present trial if he may
 find mercy in the law tis his if none
 let him not seek t of us by day and night
 he's traitor to the height

chamberlain as far as i see all the good our english

 a fit or two o the face but they are shrewd ones
 for when they hold em you would swear directly
 their very noses had been counsellors
 to pepin or clotharius they keep state so
sands they have all new legs and lame ones one would take it

 to think an english courtier may be wise
 and never see the louvre
lovell they must either
 for so run the conditions leave those remnants
 of fool and feather that they got in france
 with all their honourable point of ignorance
 pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks
 abusing better men than they can be
 out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean
 the faith they have in tennis and tall stockings
 short blister'd breeches and those types of travel
 and understand again like honest men
 or pack to their old playfellows there i take it
 they may cum privilegio wear away
 the lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at
sands tis time to give em physic their diseases
 are grown so catching
chamberlain what a loss our ladies
 will have of these trim vanities
lovell ay marry
 there will be woe indeed lords the sly whoresons
 have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies
 a french song and a fiddle has no fellow
sands the devil fiddle em i am glad they are going

 an honest country lord as i am beaten
 a long time out of play may bring his plainsong
 and have an hour of hearing and by'r lady
 held current music too

chamberlain no doubt he's noble

 we shall be late else which i would not be

act ii
scene i westminster a street
 enter two gentlemen meeting
first gentleman whither away so fast
second gentleman o god save ye
 even to the hall to hear what shall become
 of the great duke of buckingham
first gentleman i'll save you
 that labour sir all's now done but the ceremony
 of bringing back the prisoner
second gentleman were you there
first gentleman yes indeed was i
second gentleman pray speak what has happen'd
first gentleman you may guess quickly what
second gentleman is he found guilty
first gentleman yes truly is he and condemn'd upon't
second gentleman i am sorry for't
first gentleman so are a number more
second gentleman but pray how pass'd it
first gentleman i'll tell you in a little the great duke
 came to the bar where to his accusations
 he pleaded still not guilty and alleged
 many sharp reasons to defeat the law
 the king's attorney on the contrary
 urged on the examinations proofs confessions
 of divers witnesses which the duke desired
 to have brought viva voce to his face
 at which appear'd against him his surveyor
 sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car
 confessor to him with that devilmonk
 hopkins that made this mischief
second gentleman that was he
 that fed him with his prophecies
first gentleman the same
 all these accused him strongly which he fain
 would have flung from him but indeed he could not
 and so his peers upon this evidence
 have found him guilty of high treason much
 he spoke and learnedly for life but all
 was either pitied in him or forgotten
second gentleman after all this how did he bear himself
first gentleman when he was brought again to the bar to hear
 his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd
 with such an agony he sweat extremely
 and something spoke in choler ill and hasty
 but he fell to himself again and sweetly
 in all the rest show'd a most noble patience
second gentleman i do not think he fears death
first gentleman sure he does not
 he never was so womanish the cause
 he may a little grieve at
second gentleman certainly
 the cardinal is the end of this
first gentleman tis likely
 by all conjectures first kildare's attainder
 then deputy of ireland who removed
 earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too
 lest he should help his father
second gentleman that trick of state
 was a deep envious one
first gentleman at his return
 no doubt he will requite it this is noted
 and generally whoever the king favours
 the cardinal instantly will find employment
 and far enough from court too
second gentleman all the commons
 hate him perniciously and o my conscience
 wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much
 they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham
 the mirror of all courtesy
first gentleman stay there sir
 and see the noble ruin'd man you speak of
 enter buckingham from his arraignment tipstaves
 before him the axe with the edge towards him
 halberds on each side accompanied with lovell
 vaux sands and common people
second gentleman let's stand close and behold him
buckingham all good people
 you that thus far have come to pity me
 hear what i say and then go home and lose me
 i have this day received a traitor's judgment
 and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
 and if i have a conscience let it sink me
 even as the axe falls if i be not faithful
 the law i bear no malice for my death
 t has done upon the premises but justice
 but those that sought it i could wish more christians
 be what they will i heartily forgive em
 yet let em look they glory not in mischief
 nor build their evils on the graves of great men
 for then my guiltless blood must cry against em
 for further life in this world i ne'er hope
 nor will i sue although the king have mercies
 more than i dare make faults you few that loved me
 and dare be bold to weep for buckingham
 his noble friends and fellows whom to leave
 is only bitter to him only dying
 go with me like good angels to my end
 and as the long divorce of steel falls on me
 make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
 and lift my soul to heaven lead on o god's name
lovell i do beseech your grace for charity
 if ever any malice in your heart
 were hid against me now to forgive me frankly
buckingham sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you
 as i would be forgiven i forgive all
 there cannot be those numberless offences
 gainst me that i cannot take peace with
 no black envy
 shall mark my grave commend me to his grace
 and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him
 you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers
 yet are the king's and till my soul forsake
 shall cry for blessings on him may he live
 longer than i have time to tell his years
 ever beloved and loving may his rule be
 and when old time shall lead him to his end
 goodness and he fill up one monument
lovell to the water side i must conduct your grace
 then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux
 who undertakes you to your end
vaux prepare there
 the duke is coming see the barge be ready
 and fit it with such furniture as suits
 the greatness of his person
buckingham nay sir nicholas
 let it alone my state now will but mock me
 when i came hither i was lord high constable
 and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun
 yet i am richer than my base accusers
 that never knew what truth meant i now seal it
 and with that blood will make em one day groan for't
 my noble father henry of buckingham
 who first raised head against usurping richard
 flying for succor to his servant banister
 being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd
 and without trial fell god's peace be with him
 henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying
 my father's loss like a most royal prince
 restored me to my honours and out of ruins
 made my name once more noble now his son
 henry the eighth life honour name and all
 that made me happy at one stroke has taken
 for ever from the world i had my trial
 and must needs say a noble one which makes me
 a little happier than my wretched father
 yet thus far we are one in fortunes both
 fell by our servants by those men we loved most
 a most unnatural and faithless service
 heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me
 this from a dying man receive as certain
 where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
 be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
 and give your hearts to when they once perceive
 the least rub in your fortunes fall away
 like water from ye never found again
 but where they mean to sink ye all good people
 pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour
 of my long weary life is come upon me farewell
 and when you would say something that is sad
 speak how i fell i have done and god forgive me
 exeunt buckingham and train
first gentleman o this is full of pity sir it calls
 i fear too many curses on their beads
 that were the authors
second gentleman if the duke be guiltless
 tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling
 of an ensuing evil if it fall
 greater than this
first gentleman good angels keep it from us
 what may it be you do not doubt my faith sir
second gentleman this secret is so weighty twill require
 a strong faith to conceal it
first gentleman let me have it
 i do not talk much
second gentleman i am confident
 you shall sir did you not of late days hear
 a buzzing of a separation
 between the king and katharine
first gentleman yes but it held not
 for when the king once heard it out of anger
 he sent command to the lord mayor straight
 to stop the rumor and allay those tongues
 that durst disperse it
second gentleman but that slander sir
 is found a truth now for it grows again
 fresher than e'er it was and held for certain
 the king will venture at it either the cardinal
 or some about him near have out of malice
 to the good queen possess'd him with a scruple
 that will undo her to confirm this too
 cardinal campeius is arrived and lately
 as all think for this business
first gentleman tis the cardinal
 and merely to revenge him on the emperor
 for not bestowing on him at his asking
 the archbishopric of toledo this is purposed
second gentleman i think you have hit the mark but is't not cruel
 that she should feel the smart of this the cardinal
 will have his will and she must fall
first gentleman tis woful
 we are too open here to argue this
 let's think in private more

 about his neck yet never lost her lustre

 that angels love good men with even of her
 that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls

 his highness having lived so long with her and she
 so good a lady that no tongue could ever
 pronounce dishonour of her by my life
 she never knew harmdoing o now after
 so many courses of the sun enthroned
 still growing in a majesty and pomp the which
 to leave a thousandfold more bitter than
 tis sweet at first to acquireafter this process
 to give her the avaunt it is a pity
 would move a monster
old lady hearts of most hard temper
 melt and lament for her
anne o god's will much better
 she ne'er had known pomp though't be temporal
 yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce
 it from the bearer tis a sufferance panging
 as soul and body's severing
old lady alas poor lady
 she's a stranger now again
anne so much the more
 must pity drop upon her verily
 i swear tis better to be lowly born
 and range with humble livers in content
 than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief
 and wear a golden sorrow
old lady our content
 is our best having
anne by my troth and maidenhead
 i would not be a queen
old lady beshrew me i would
 and venture maidenhead for't and so would you
 for all this spice of your hypocrisy
 you that have so fair parts of woman on you
 have too a woman's heart which ever yet
 affected eminence wealth sovereignty
 which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts
 saving your mincing the capacity
 of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
 if you might please to stretch it
anne nay good troth
old lady yes troth and troth you would not be a queen
anne no not for all the riches under heaven
old lady tis strange a threepence bow'd would hire me
 old as i am to queen it but i pray you
 what think you of a duchess have you limbs
 to bear that load of title
anne no in truth
old lady then you are weakly made pluck off a little
 i would not be a young count in your way
 for more than blushing comes to if your back
 cannot vouchsafe this burthen'tis too weak
 ever to get a boy
anne how you do talk
 i swear again i would not be a queen
 for all the world
old lady in faith for little england
 you'ld venture an emballing i myself
 would for carnarvonshire although there long'd
 no more to the crown but that lo who comes here
 enter chamberlain
chamberlain good morrow ladies what were't worth to know
 the secret of your conference
anne my good lord
 not your demand it values not your asking
 our mistress sorrows we were pitying
chamberlain it was a gentle business and becoming
 the action of good women there is hope
 all will be well
anne now i pray god amen
chamberlain you bear a gentle mind and heavenly blessings
 follow such creatures that you may fair lady
 perceive i speak sincerely and high note's
 ta'en of your many virtues the king's majesty
 commends his good opinion of you and
 does purpose honour to you no less flowing
 than marchioness of pembroke to which title
 a thousand pound a year annual support
 out of his grace he adds
anne i do not know
 what kind of my obedience i should tender
 more than my all is nothing nor my prayers
 are not words duly hallow'd nor my wishes
 more worth than empty vanities yet prayers and wishes
 are all i can return beseech your lordship
 vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience
 as from a blushing handmaid to his highness
 whose health and royalty i pray for
chamberlain lady
 i shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
 the king hath of you

 hath my behavior given to your displeasure
 that thus you should proceed to put me off
 and take your good grace from me heaven witness
 i have been to you a true and humble wife
 at all times to your will conformable
 ever in fear to kindle your dislike
 yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry
 as i saw it inclined when was the hour
 i ever contradicted your desire
 or made it not mine too or which of your friends
 have i not strove to love although i knew
 he were mine enemy what friend of mine
 that had to him derived your anger did i
 continue in my liking nay gave notice
 he was from thence discharged sir call to mind

 shut door upon me and so give me up
 to the sharp'st kind of justice please you sir
 the king your father was reputed for
 a prince most prudent of an excellent
 and unmatch'd wit and judgment ferdinand
 my father king of spain was reckon'd one
 the wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
 a year before it is not to be question'd
 that they had gather'd a wise council to them
 of every realm that did debate this business
 who deem'd our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly
 beseech you sir to spare me till i may
 be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel
 i will implore if not i the name of god
 your pleasure be fulfill'd
cardinal wolsey you have here lady
 and of your choice these reverend fathers men
 of singular integrity and learning
 yea the elect o the land who are assembled
 to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless
 that longer you desire the court as well
 for your own quiet as to rectify
 what is unsettled in the king
cardinal campeius his grace
 hath spoken well and justly therefore madam
 it's fit this royal session do proceed
 and that without delay their arguments
 be now produced and heard
queen katharine lord cardinal
 to you i speak
cardinal wolsey your pleasure madam
queen katharine sir
 i am about to weep but thinking that
 we are a queen or long have dream'd so certain
 the daughter of a king my drops of tears
 i'll turn to sparks of fire
cardinal wolsey be patient yet
queen katharine i will when you are humble nay before
 or god will punish me i do believe
 induced by potent circumstances that
 you are mine enemy and make my challenge
 you shall not be my judge for it is you
 have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me
 which god's dew quench therefore i say again
 i utterly abhor yea from my soul
 refuse you for my judge whom yet once more
 i hold my most malicious foe and think not
 at all a friend to truth
cardinal wolsey i do profess
 you speak not like yourself who ever yet
 have stood to charity and display'd the effects
 of disposition gentle and of wisdom
 o'ertopping woman's power madam you do me wrong
 i have no spleen against you nor injustice
 for you or any how far i have proceeded
 or how far further shall is warranted
 by a commission from the consistory
 yea the whole consistory of rome you charge me
 that i have blown this coal i do deny it
 the king is present if it be known to him
 that i gainsay my deed how may he wound
 and worthily my falsehood yea as much
 as you have done my truth if he know
 that i am free of your report he knows
 i am not of your wrong therefore in him
 it lies to cure me and the cure is to
 remove these thoughts from you the which before
 his highness shall speak in i do beseech
 you gracious madam to unthink your speaking
 and to say so no more
queen katharine my lord my lord
 i am a simple woman much too weak
 to oppose your cunning you're meek and
 humblemouth'd
 you sign your place and calling in full seeming
 with meekness and humility but your heart
 is cramm'd with arrogancy spleen and pride
 you have by fortune and his highness favours
 gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted
 where powers are your retainers and your words
 domestics to you serve your will as't please
 yourself pronounce their office i must tell you
 you tender more your person's honour than
 your high profession spiritual that again
 i do refuse you for my judge and here
 before you all appeal unto the pope
 to bring my whole cause fore his holiness
 and to be judged by him
 she curtsies to king henry viii and offers to depart
cardinal campeius the queen is obstinate
 stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and
 disdainful to be tried by't tis not well
 she's going away
king henry viii call her again
crier katharine queen of england come into the court
griffith madam you are call'd back
queen katharine what need you note it pray you keep your way
 when you are call'd return now the lord help
 they vex me past my patience pray you pass on
 i will not tarry no nor ever more
 upon this business my appearance make
 in any of their courts
 exeunt queen katharine and her attendants
king henry viii go thy ways kate
 that man i the world who shall report he has
 a better wife let him in nought be trusted
 for speaking false in that thou art alone
 if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness
 thy meekness saintlike wifelike government
 obeying in commanding and thy parts
 sovereign and pious else could speak thee out
 the queen of earthly queens she's noble born
 and like her true nobility she has
 carried herself towards me
cardinal wolsey most gracious sir
 in humblest manner i require your highness
 that it shall please you to declare in hearing
 of all these earsfor where i am robb'd and bound
 there must i be unloosed although not there
 at once and fully satisfiedwhether ever i
 did broach this business to your highness or
 laid any scruple in your way which might
 induce you to the question on't or ever
 have to you but with thanks to god for such
 a royal lady spake one the least word that might
 be to the prejudice of her present state
 or touch of her good person
king henry viii my lord cardinal
 i do excuse you yea upon mine honour
 i free you from't you are not to be taught
 that you have many enemies that know not
 why they are so but like to villagecurs
 bark when their fellows do by some of these
 the queen is put in anger you're excused
 but will you be more justified you ever
 have wish'd the sleeping of this business never desired
 it to be stirr'd but oft have hinder'd oft
 the passages made toward it on my honour
 i speak my good lord cardinal to this point
 and thus far clear him now what moved me to't
 i will be bold with time and your attention
 then mark the inducement thus it came give heed to't
 my conscience first received a tenderness
 scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd
 by the bishop of bayonne then french ambassador
 who had been hither sent on the debating
 a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and
 our daughter mary i the progress of this business
 ere a determinate resolution he
 i mean the bishop did require a respite
 wherein he might the king his lord advertise
 whether our daughter were legitimate
 respecting this our marriage with the dowager
 sometimes our brother's wife this respite shook
 the bosom of my conscience enter'd me
 yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
 the region of my breast which forced such way
 that many mazed considerings did throng
 and press'd in with this caution first methought
 i stood not in the smile of heaven who had
 commanded nature that my lady's womb
 if it conceived a male child by me should
 do no more offices of life to't than
 the grave does to the dead for her male issue
 or died where they were made or shortly after
 this world had air'd them hence i took a thought
 this was a judgment on me that my kingdom
 well worthy the best heir o the world should not
 be gladded in't by me then follows that
 i weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
 by this my issue's fail and that gave to me
 many a groaning throe thus hulling in
 the wild sea of my conscience i did steer
 toward this remedy whereupon we are
 now present here together that's to say
 i meant to rectify my consciencewhich
 i then did feel full sick and yet not well
 by all the reverend fathers of the land
 and doctors learn'd first i began in private
 with you my lord of lincoln you remember
 how under my oppression i did reek
 when i first moved you
lincoln very well my liege
king henry viii i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say
 how far you satisfied me
lincoln so please your highness
 the question did at first so stagger me
 bearing a state of mighty moment in't
 and consequence of dread that i committed
 the daring'st counsel which i had to doubt
 and did entreat your highness to this course
 which you are running here
king henry viii i then moved you
 my lord of canterbury and got your leave
 to make this present summons unsolicited
 i left no reverend person in this court
 but by particular consent proceeded
 under your hands and seals therefore go on
 for no dislike i the world against the person
 of the good queen but the sharp thorny points
 of my alleged reasons drive this forward
 prove but our marriage lawful by my life
 and kingly dignity we are contented
 to wear our mortal state to come with her
 katharine our queen before the primest creature
 that's paragon'd o the world
cardinal campeius so please your highness
 the queen being absent tis a needful fitness
 that we adjourn this court till further day
 meanwhile must be an earnest motion
 made to the queen to call back her appeal
 she intends unto his holiness
king henry viii aside i may perceive
 these cardinals trifle with me i abhor
 this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome
 my learn'd and wellbeloved servant cranmer
 prithee return with thy approach i know
 my comfort comes along break up the court
 i say set on
 exeunt in manner as they entered

scene i london queen katharine's apartments
 enter queen katharine and her women as at work
queen katharine take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles
 sing and disperse em if thou canst leave working
 song
 orpheus with his lute made trees
 and the mountain tops that freeze
 bow themselves when he did sing
 to his music plants and flowers
 ever sprung as sun and showers
 there had made a lasting spring
 every thing that heard him play
 even the billows of the sea
 hung their heads and then lay by
 in sweet music is such art
 killing care and grief of heart
 fall asleep or hearing die
 enter a gentleman
queen katharine how now
gentleman an't please your grace the two great cardinals
 wait in the presence
queen katharine would they speak with me
gentleman they will'd me say so madam
queen katharine pray their graces

 they should be good men their affairs as righteous
 but all hoods make not monks
 enter cardinal wolsey and cardinal campeius
cardinal wolsey peace to your highness
queen katharine your graces find me here part of a housewife
 i would be all against the worst may happen
 what are your pleasures with me reverend lords
cardinal wolsey may it please you noble madam to withdraw
 into your private chamber we shall give you
 the full cause of our coming
queen katharine speak it here
 there's nothing i have done yet o my conscience
 deserves a corner would all other women
 could speak this with as free a soul as i do
 my lords i care not so much i am happy
 above a number if my actions
 were tried by every tongue every eye saw em
 envy and base opinion set against em
 i know my life so even if your business
 seek me out and that way i am wife in
 out with it boldly truth loves open dealing
cardinal wolsey tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina
 serenissima
queen katharine o good my lord no latin
 i am not such a truant since my coming
 as not to know the language i have lived in
 a strange tongue makes my cause more strange
 suspicious
 pray speak in english here are some will thank you
 if you speak truth for their poor mistress sake
 believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal
 the willing'st sin i ever yet committed
 may be absolved in english
cardinal wolsey noble lady
 i am sorry my integrity should breed
 and service to his majesty and you
 so deep suspicion where all faith was meant
 we come not by the way of accusation
 to taint that honour every good tongue blesses
 nor to betray you any way to sorrow
 you have too much good lady but to know
 how you stand minded in the weighty difference
 between the king and you and to deliver
 like free and honest men our just opinions
 and comforts to your cause
cardinal campeius most honour'd madam
 my lord of york out of his noble nature
 zeal and obedience he still bore your grace
 forgetting like a good man your late censure
 both of his truth and him which was too far
 offers as i do in a sign of peace
 his service and his counsel
queen katharine aside to betray me
 my lords i thank you both for your good wills
 ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so
 but how to make ye suddenly an answer
 in such a point of weight so near mine honour
 more near my life i fearwith my weak wit
 and to such men of gravity and learning
 in truth i know not i was set at work
 among my maids full little god knows looking
 either for such men or such business
 for her sake that i have beenfor i feel
 the last fit of my greatnessgood your graces
 let me have time and counsel for my cause
 alas i am a woman friendless hopeless
cardinal wolsey madam you wrong the king's love with these fears
 your hopes and friends are infinite
queen katharine in england
 but little for my profit can you think lords
 that any englishman dare give me counsel
 or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure
 though he be grown so desperate to be honest
 and live a subject nay forsooth my friends
 they that must weigh out my afflictions
 they that my trust must grow to live not here
 they are as all my other comforts far hence
 in mine own country lords
cardinal campeius i would your grace
 would leave your griefs and take my counsel
queen katharine how sir
cardinal campeius put your main cause into the king's protection
 he's loving and most gracious twill be much
 both for your honour better and your cause
 for if the trial of the law o'ertake ye
 you'll part away disgraced
cardinal wolsey he tells you rightly
queen katharine ye tell me what ye wish for bothmy ruin
 is this your christian counsel out upon ye
 heaven is above all yet there sits a judge
 that no king can corrupt
cardinal campeius your rage mistakes us
queen katharine the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye
 upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues
 but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye
 mend em for shame my lords is this your comfort
 the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
 a woman lost among ye laugh'd at scorn'd
 i will not wish ye half my miseries
 i have more charity but say i warn'd ye
 take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once
 the burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye
cardinal wolsey madam this is a mere distraction
 you turn the good we offer into envy
queen katharine ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye
 and all such false professors would you have me
 if you have any justice any pity
 if ye be any thing but churchmen's habits
 put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
 alas has banish'd me his bed already
 his love too long ago i am old my lords
 and all the fellowship i hold now with him
 is only my obedience what can happen
 to me above this wretchedness all your studies
 make me a curse like this
cardinal campeius your fears are worse
queen katharine have i lived thus longlet me speak myself
 since virtue finds no friendsa wife a true one
 a woman i dare say without vainglory
 never yet branded with suspicion
 have i with all my full affections
 still met the king loved him next heaven
 obey'd him
 been out of fondness superstitious to him
 almost forgot my prayers to content him
 and am i thus rewarded tis not well lords
 bring me a constant woman to her husband
 one that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure
 and to that woman when she has done most
 yet will i add an honour a great patience
cardinal wolsey madam you wander from the good we aim at
queen katharine my lord i dare not make myself so guilty
 to give up willingly that noble title
 your master wed me to nothing but death
 shall e'er divorce my dignities
cardinal wolsey pray hear me
queen katharine would i had never trod this english earth
 or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
 ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts
 what will become of me now wretched lady
 i am the most unhappy woman living
 alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes
 shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity
 no friend no hope no kindred weep for me
 almost no grave allow'd me like the lily
 that once was mistress of the field and flourish'd
 i'll hang my head and perish
cardinal wolsey if your grace
 could but be brought to know our ends are honest
 you'ld feel more comfort why should we good lady
 upon what cause wrong you alas our places
 the way of our profession is against it
 we are to cure such sorrows not to sow em
 for goodness sake consider what you do
 how you may hurt yourself ay utterly
 grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage
 the hearts of princes kiss obedience
 so much they love it but to stubborn spirits
 they swell and grow as terrible as storms
 i know you have a gentle noble temper
 a soul as even as a calm pray think us
 those we profess peacemakers friends and servants
cardinal campeius madam you'll find it so you wrong your virtues
 with these weak women's fears a noble spirit
 as yours was put into you ever casts
 such doubts as false coin from it the king loves you
 beware you lose it not for us if you please
 to trust us in your business we are ready
 to use our utmost studies in your service
queen katharine do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me
 if i have used myself unmannerly
 you know i am a woman lacking wit
 to make a seemly answer to such persons
 pray do my service to his majesty
 he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
 while i shall have my life come reverend fathers
 bestow your counsels on me she now begs
 that little thought when she set footing here
 she should have bought her dignities so dear

 and force them with a constancy the cardinal
 cannot stand under them if you omit
 the offer of this time i cannot promise

surrey i am joyful
 to meet the least occasion that may give me
 remembrance of my fatherinlaw the duke

surrey how came
 his practises to light
suffolk most strangely
surrey o how how
suffolk the cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried
 and came to the eye o the king wherein was read
 how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
 to stay the judgment o the divorce for if

 a creature of the queen's lady anne bullen'
surrey has the king this

surrey sharp enough
 lord for thy justice
cardinal wolsey aside the late queen's gentlewoman
 a knight's daughter
 to be her mistress mistress the queen's queen
 this candle burns not clear tis i must snuff it
 then out it goes what though i know her virtuous
 and well deserving yet i know her for
 a spleeny lutheran and not wholesome to
 our cause that she should lie i the bosom of
 our hardruled king again there is sprung up
 an heretic an arch one cranmer one
 hath crawl'd into the favour of the king
 and is his oracle
norfolk he is vex'd at something
surrey i would twere something that would fret the string
 the mastercord on's heart
 enter king henry viii reading of a schedule and lovell
suffolk the king the king
king henry viii what piles of wealth hath he accumulated
 to his own portion and what expense by the hour
 seems to flow from him how i the name of thrift
 does he rake this together now my lords
 saw you the cardinal
norfolk my lord we have
 stood here observing him some strange commotion
 is in his brain he bites his lip and starts
 stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
 then lays his finger on his temple straight
 springs out into fast gait then stops again
 strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
 his eye against the moon in most strange postures
 we have seen him set himself
king henry viii it may well be
 there is a mutiny in's mind this morning
 papers of state he sent me to peruse
 as i required and wot you what i found
 thereon my conscience put unwittingly
 forsooth an inventory thus importing
 the several parcels of his plate his treasure
 rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
 i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
 possession of a subject
norfolk it's heaven's will
 some spirit put this paper in the packet
 to bless your eye withal
king henry viii if we did think
 his contemplation were above the earth
 and fix'd on spiritual object he should still
 dwell in his musings but i am afraid
 his thinkings are below the moon not worth
 his serious considering
 king henry viii takes his seat whispers lovell
 who goes to cardinal wolsey
cardinal wolsey heaven forgive me
 ever god bless your highness
king henry viii good my lord
 you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory
 of your best graces in your mind the which
 you were now running o'er you have scarce time
 to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
 to keep your earthly audit sure in that
 i deem you an ill husband and am glad
 to have you therein my companion
cardinal wolsey sir
 for holy offices i have a time a time
 to think upon the part of business which
 i bear i the state and nature does require
 her times of preservation which perforce
 i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal
 must give my tendence to
king henry viii you have said well
cardinal wolsey and ever may your highness yoke together
 as i will lend you cause my doing well
 with my well saying
king henry viii tis well said again
 and tis a kind of good deed to say well
 and yet words are no deeds my father loved you
 his said he did and with his deed did crown
 his word upon you since i had my office
 i have kept you next my heart have not alone
 employ'd you where high profits might come home
 but pared my present havings to bestow
 my bounties upon you
cardinal wolsey aside what should this mean
surrey aside the lord increase this business
king henry viii have i not made you
 the prime man of the state i pray you tell me
 if what i now pronounce you have found true
 and if you may confess it say withal
 if you are bound to us or no what say you
cardinal wolsey my sovereign i confess your royal graces
 shower'd on me daily have been more than could
 my studied purposes requite which went
 beyond all man's endeavours my endeavours
 have ever come too short of my desires
 yet filed with my abilities mine own ends
 have been mine so that evermore they pointed
 to the good of your most sacred person and
 the profit of the state for your great graces
 heap'd upon me poor undeserver i
 can nothing render but allegiant thanks
 my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty
 which ever has and ever shall be growing
 till death that winter kill it
king henry viii fairly answer'd
 a loyal and obedient subject is
 therein illustrated the honour of it
 does pay the act of it as i the contrary
 the foulness is the punishment i presume
 that as my hand has open'd bounty to you
 my heart dropp'd love my power rain'd honour more
 on you than any so your hand and heart
 your brain and every function of your power
 should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
 as twere in love's particular be more
 to me your friend than any
cardinal wolsey i do profess
 that for your highness good i ever labour'd
 more than mine own that am have and will be
 though all the world should crack their duty to you
 and throw it from their soul though perils did
 abound as thick as thought could make em and
 appear in forms more horridyet my duty
 as doth a rock against the chiding flood
 should the approach of this wild river break
 and stand unshaken yours
king henry viii tis nobly spoken
 take notice lords he has a loyal breast
 for you have seen him open't read o'er this
 giving him papers
 and after this and then to breakfast with
 what appetite you have
 exit king henry viii frowning upon cardinal wolsey
 the nobles throng after him smiling and whispering
cardinal wolsey what should this mean
 what sudden anger's this how have i reap'd it
 he parted frowning from me as if ruin
 leap'd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion
 upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him
 then makes him nothing i must read this paper
 i fear the story of his anger tis so
 this paper has undone me tis the account
 of all that world of wealth i have drawn together
 for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
 and fee my friends in rome o negligence
 fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil
 made me put this main secret in the packet
 i sent the king is there no way to cure this
 no new device to beat this from his brains
 i know twill stir him strongly yet i know
 a way if it take right in spite of fortune
 will bring me off again what's this to the pope'
 the letter as i live with all the business
 i writ to's holiness nay then farewell
 i have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness
 and from that full meridian of my glory
 i haste now to my setting i shall fall
 like a bright exhalation m the evening
 and no man see me more
 reenter to cardinal wolsey norfolk and suffolk surrey
 and the chamberlain
norfolk hear the king's pleasure cardinal who commands you
 to render up the great seal presently
 into our hands and to confine yourself
 to asher house my lord of winchester's
 till you hear further from his highness
cardinal wolsey stay
 where's your commission lords words cannot carry
 authority so weighty
suffolk who dare cross em
 bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly
cardinal wolsey till i find more than will or words to do it
 i mean your malice know officious lords
 i dare and must deny it now i feel
 of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy
 how eagerly ye follow my disgraces
 as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton
 ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
 follow your envious courses men of malice
 you have christian warrant for em and no doubt
 in time will find their fit rewards that seal
 you ask with such a violence the king
 mine and your master with his own hand gave me
 bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
 during my life and to confirm his goodness
 tied it by letterspatents now who'll take it
surrey the king that gave it
cardinal wolsey it must be himself then
surrey thou art a proud traitor priest
cardinal wolsey proud lord thou liest
 within these forty hours surrey durst better
 have burnt that tongue than said so
surrey thy ambition
 thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land
 of noble buckingham my fatherinlaw
 the heads of all thy brother cardinals
 with thee and all thy best parts bound together
 weigh'd not a hair of his plague of your policy
 you sent me deputy for ireland
 far from his succor from the king from all
 that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him
 whilst your great goodness out of holy pity
 absolved him with an axe
cardinal wolsey this and all else
 this talking lord can lay upon my credit
 i answer is most false the duke by law
 found his deserts how innocent i was
 from any private malice in his end
 his noble jury and foul cause can witness
 if i loved many words lord i should tell you
 you have as little honesty as honour
 that in the way of loyalty and truth
 toward the king my ever royal master
 dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be
 and all that love his follies
surrey by my soul
 your long coat priest protects you thou
 shouldst feel
 my sword i the lifeblood of thee else my lords
 can ye endure to hear this arrogance
 and from this fellow if we live thus tamely
 to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet
 farewell nobility let his grace go forward
 and dare us with his cap like larks
cardinal wolsey all goodness
 is poison to thy stomach
surrey yes that goodness
 of gleaning all the land's wealth into one
 into your own hands cardinal by extortion
 the goodness of your intercepted packets
 you writ to the pope against the king your goodness
 since you provoke me shall be most notorious
 my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble
 as you respect the common good the state
 of our despised nobility our issues
 who if he live will scarce be gentlemen
 produce the grand sum of his sins the articles
 collected from his life i'll startle you
 worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench
 lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal
cardinal wolsey how much methinks i could despise this man
 but that i am bound in charity against it
norfolk those articles my lord are in the king's hand
 but thus much they are foul ones
cardinal wolsey so much fairer
 and spotless shall mine innocence arise
 when the king knows my truth
surrey this cannot save you
 i thank my memory i yet remember
 some of these articles and out they shall
 now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal
 you'll show a little honesty
cardinal wolsey speak on sir
 i dare your worst objections if i blush
 it is to see a nobleman want manners
surrey i had rather want those than my head have at you
 first that without the king's assent or knowledge
 you wrought to be a legate by which power
 you maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops
norfolk then that in all you writ to rome or else
 to foreign princes ego et rex meus'
 was still inscribed in which you brought the king
 to be your servant
suffolk then that without the knowledge
 either of king or council when you went
 ambassador to the emperor you made bold
 to carry into flanders the great seal
surrey item you sent a large commission
 to gregory de cassado to conclude
 without the king's will or the state's allowance
 a league between his highness and ferrara
suffolk that out of mere ambition you have caused
 your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin
surrey then that you have sent innumerable substance
 by what means got i leave to your own conscience
 to furnish rome and to prepare the ways
 you have for dignities to the mere undoing
 of all the kingdom many more there are
 which since they are of you and odious
 i will not taint my mouth with
chamberlain o my lord
 press not a falling man too far tis virtue
 his faults lie open to the laws let them
 not you correct him my heart weeps to see him
 so little of his great self
surrey i forgive him
suffolk lord cardinal the king's further pleasure is
 because all those things you have done of late
 by your power legatine within this kingdom
 fall into the compass of a praemunire
 that therefore such a writ be sued against you
 to forfeit all your goods lands tenements
 chattels and whatsoever and to be
 out of the king's protection this is my charge
norfolk and so we'll leave you to your meditations
 how to live better for your stubborn answer
 about the giving back the great seal to us
 the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
 so fare you well my little good lord cardinal
 exeunt all but cardinal wolsey
cardinal wolsey so farewell to the little good you bear me
 farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
 this is the state of man today he puts forth
 the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms
 and bears his blushing honours thick upon him
 the third day comes a frost a killing frost
 and when he thinks good easy man full surely
 his greatness is aripening nips his root
 and then he falls as i do i have ventured
 like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
 this many summers in a sea of glory
 but far beyond my depth my highblown pride
 at length broke under me and now has left me
 weary and old with service to the mercy
 of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
 vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye
 i feel my heart new open'd o how wretched
 is that poor man that hangs on princes favours
 there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
 that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
 more pangs and fears than wars or women have
 and when he falls he falls like lucifer
 never to hope again
 enter cromwell and stands amazed
 why how now cromwell
cromwell i have no power to speak sir
cardinal wolsey what amazed
 at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder
 a great man should decline nay an you weep
 i am fall'n indeed
cromwell how does your grace
cardinal wolsey why well
 never so truly happy my good cromwell
 i know myself now and i feel within me
 a peace above all earthly dignities
 a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me
 i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders
 these ruin'd pillars out of pity taken
 a load would sink a navy too much honour
 o tis a burthen cromwell tis a burthen
 too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
cromwell i am glad your grace has made that right use of it
cardinal wolsey i hope i have i am able now methinks
 out of a fortitude of soul i feel
 to endure more miseries and greater far
 than my weakhearted enemies dare offer
 what news abroad
cromwell the heaviest and the worst
 is your displeasure with the king
cardinal wolsey god bless him
cromwell the next is that sir thomas more is chosen
 lord chancellor in your place
cardinal wolsey that's somewhat sudden
 but he's a learned man may he continue
 long in his highness favour and do justice
 for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones
 when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
 may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em what more
cromwell that cranmer is return'd with welcome
 install'd lord archbishop of canterbury
cardinal wolsey that's news indeed
cromwell last that the lady anne
 whom the king hath in secrecy long married
 this day was view'd in open as his queen
 going to chapel and the voice is now
 only about her coronation
cardinal wolsey there was the weight that pull'd me down o cromwell
 the king has gone beyond me all my glories
 in that one woman i have lost for ever
 no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
 or gild again the noble troops that waited
 upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell
 i am a poor fall'n man unworthy now
 to be thy lord and master seek the king
 that sun i pray may never set i have told him
 what and how true thou art he will advance thee
 some little memory of me will stir him
 i know his noble naturenot to let
 thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell
 neglect him not make use now and provide
 for thine own future safety
cromwell o my lord
 must i then leave you must i needs forego
 so good so noble and so true a master
 bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
 with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord
 the king shall have my service but my prayers
 for ever and for ever shall be yours
cardinal wolsey cromwell i did not think to shed a tear
 in all my miseries but thou hast forced me
 out of thy honest truth to play the woman
 let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell
 and when i am forgotten as i shall be
 and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
 of me more must be heard of say i taught thee
 say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
 and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
 found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in
 a sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it
 mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me
 cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition
 by that sin fell the angels how can man then
 the image of his maker hope to win by it
 love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee
 corruption wins not more than honesty
 still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
 to silence envious tongues be just and fear not
 let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's
 thy god's and truth's then if thou fall'st
 o cromwell
 thou fall'st a blessed martyr serve the king
 andprithee lead me in
 there take an inventory of all i have
 to the last penny tis the king's my robe
 and my integrity to heaven is all
 i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell
 had i but served my god with half the zeal
 i served my king he would not in mine age
 have left me naked to mine enemies
cromwell good sir have patience
cardinal wolsey so i have farewell
 the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell

act iv
scene i a street in westminster
 enter two gentlemen meeting one another
first gentleman you're well met once again
second gentleman so are you
first gentleman you come to take your stand here and behold
 the lady anne pass from her coronation
second gentleman tis all my business at our last encounter
 the duke of buckingham came from his trial
first gentleman tis very true but that time offer'd sorrow
 this general joy
second gentleman tis well the citizens
 i am sure have shown at full their royal minds
 as let em have their rights they are ever forward
 in celebration of this day with shows
 pageants and sights of honour
first gentleman never greater
 nor i'll assure you better taken sir
second gentleman may i be bold to ask at what that contains
 that paper in your hand
first gentleman yes tis the list
 of those that claim their offices this day
 by custom of the coronation
 the duke of suffolk is the first and claims
 to be highsteward next the duke of norfolk
 he to be earl marshal you may read the rest
second gentleman i thank you sir had i not known those customs
 i should have been beholding to your paper
 but i beseech you what's become of katharine
 the princess dowager how goes her business
first gentleman that i can tell you too the archbishop
 of canterbury accompanied with other
 learned and reverend fathers of his order
 held a late court at dunstable six miles off
 from ampthill where the princess lay to which
 she was often cited by them but appear'd not
 and to be short for not appearance and
 the king's late scruple by the main assent
 of all these learned men she was divorced
 and the late marriage made of none effect
 since which she was removed to kimbolton
 where she remains now sick
second gentleman alas good lady
 trumpets
 the trumpets sound stand close the queen is coming
 hautboys
 the order of the coronation
 1 a lively flourish of trumpets
 2 then two judges
 3 lord chancellor with the purse and mace
 before him
 4 choristers singing
 music
 5 mayor of london bearing the mace then
 garter in his coat of arms and on his
 head a gilt copper crown
 6 marquess dorset bearing a sceptre of gold
 on his head a demicoronal of gold with
 him surrey bearing the rod of silver with
 the dove crowned with an earl's coronet
 collars of ss
 7 suffolk in his robe of estate his coronet
 on his head bearing a long white wand as
 highsteward with him norfolk with the
 rod of marshalship a coronet on his head
 collars of ss
 8 a canopy borne by four of the cinqueports
 under it queen anne in her robe in her hair
 richly adorned with pearl crowned on each
 side her the bishops of london and
 winchester
 9 the old duchess of norfolk in a coronal of
 gold wrought with flowers bearing queen
 anne's train
 10 certain ladies or countesses with plain
 circlets of gold without flowers
 they pass over the stage in order and state
second gentleman a royal train believe me these i know
 who's that that bears the sceptre
first gentleman marquess dorset
 and that the earl of surrey with the rod
second gentleman a bold brave gentleman that should be
 the duke of suffolk
first gentleman tis the same highsteward
second gentleman and that my lord of norfolk
first gentleman yes
second gentleman heaven bless thee
 looking on queen anne
 thou hast the sweetest face i ever look'd on
 sir as i have a soul she is an angel
 our king has all the indies in his arms
 and more and richer when he strains that lady
 i cannot blame his conscience
first gentleman they that bear
 the cloth of honour over her are four barons
 of the cinqueports
second gentleman those men are happy and so are all are near her
 i take it she that carries up the train
 is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk
first gentleman it is and all the rest are countesses
second gentleman their coronets say so these are stars indeed
 and sometimes falling ones
first gentleman no more of that
 exit procession and then a great flourish of trumpets
 enter a third gentleman
first gentleman god save you sir where have you been broiling
third gentleman among the crowd i the abbey where a finger
 could not be wedged in more i am stifled
 with the mere rankness of their joy
second gentleman you saw
 the ceremony
third gentleman that i did
first gentleman how was it
third gentleman well worth the seeing
second gentleman good sir speak it to us
third gentleman as well as i am able the rich stream
 of lords and ladies having brought the queen
 to a prepared place in the choir fell off
 a distance from her while her grace sat down
 to rest awhile some half an hour or so
 in a rich chair of state opposing freely
 the beauty of her person to the people
 believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
 that ever lay by man which when the people
 had the full view of such a noise arose
 as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
 as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks
 doublets i thinkflew up and had their faces
 been loose this day they had been lost such joy
 i never saw before greatbellied women
 that had not half a week to go like rams
 in the old time of war would shake the press
 and make em reel before em no man living
 could say this is my wife there all were woven
 so strangely in one piece
second gentleman but what follow'd
third gentleman at length her grace rose and with modest paces
 came to the altar where she kneel'd and saintlike
 cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly
 then rose again and bow'd her to the people
 when by the archbishop of canterbury
 she had all the royal makings of a queen
 as holy oil edward confessor's crown
 the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems
 laid nobly on her which perform'd the choir
 with all the choicest music of the kingdom
 together sung te deum so she parted
 and with the same full state paced back again
 to yorkplace where the feast is held
first gentleman sir
 you must no more call it yorkplace that's past
 for since the cardinal fell that title's lost
 tis now the king's and call'd whitehall
third gentleman i know it
 but tis so lately alter'd that the old name
 is fresh about me
second gentleman what two reverend bishops
 were those that went on each side of the queen
third gentleman stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester
 newly preferr'd from the king's secretary
 the other london
second gentleman he of winchester
 is held no great good lover of the archbishop's
 the virtuous cranmer
third gentleman all the land knows that
 however yet there is no great breach when it comes
 cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him
second gentleman who may that be i pray you
third gentleman thomas cromwell
 a man in much esteem with the king and truly
 a worthy friend the king has made him master
 o the jewel house
 and one already of the privy council
second gentleman he will deserve more
third gentleman yes without all doubt
 come gentlemen ye shall go my way which
 is to the court and there ye shall be my guests
 something i can command as i walk thither
 i'll tell ye more
both you may command us sir

act iv
scene ii kimbolton
 enter katharine dowager sick led between
 griffith her gentleman usher and patience her woman
griffith how does your grace
katharine o griffith sick to death
 my legs like loaden branches bow to the earth
 willing to leave their burthen reach a chair
 so now methinks i feel a little ease
 didst thou not tell me griffith as thou led'st me
 that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey was dead
griffith yes madam but i think your grace
 out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't
katharine prithee good griffith tell me how he died
 if well he stepp'd before me happily
 for my example
griffith well the voice goes madam
 for after the stout earl northumberland
 arrested him at york and brought him forward
 as a man sorely tainted to his answer
 he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
 he could not sit his mule
katharine alas poor man
griffith at last with easy roads he came to leicester
 lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot
 with all his covent honourably received him
 to whom he gave these words o father abbot
 an old man broken with the storms of state
 is come to lay his weary bones among ye
 give him a little earth for charity'
 so went to bed where eagerly his sickness
 pursued him still and three nights after this
 about the hour of eight which he himself
 foretold should be his last full of repentance
 continual meditations tears and sorrows
 he gave his honours to the world again
 his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace
katharine so may he rest his faults lie gently on him
 yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him
 and yet with charity he was a man
 of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
 himself with princes one that by suggestion
 tied all the kingdom simony was fairplay
 his own opinion was his law i the presence
 he would say untruths and be ever double
 both in his words and meaning he was never
 but where he meant to ruin pitiful
 his promises were as he then was mighty
 but his performance as he is now nothing
 of his own body he was ill and gave
 the clergy in example
griffith noble madam
 men's evil manners live in brass their virtues
 we write in water may it please your highness
 to hear me speak his good now
katharine yes good griffith
 i were malicious else
griffith this cardinal
 though from an humble stock undoubtedly
 was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle
 he was a scholar and a ripe and good one
 exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading
 lofty and sour to them that loved him not
 but to those men that sought him sweet as summer
 and though he were unsatisfied in getting
 which was a sin yet in bestowing madam
 he was most princely ever witness for him
 those twins of learning that he raised in you
 ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him
 unwilling to outlive the good that did it
 the other though unfinish'd yet so famous
 so excellent in art and still so rising
 that christendom shall ever speak his virtue
 his overthrow heap'd happiness upon him
 for then and not till then he felt himself
 and found the blessedness of being little
 and to add greater honours to his age
 than man could give him he died fearing god
katharine after my death i wish no other herald
 no other speaker of my living actions
 to keep mine honour from corruption
 but such an honest chronicler as griffith
 whom i most hated living thou hast made me
 with thy religious truth and modesty
 now in his ashes honour peace be with him
 patience be near me still and set me lower
 i have not long to trouble thee good griffith
 cause the musicians play me that sad note
 i named my knell whilst i sit meditating
 on that celestial harmony i go to
 sad and solemn music
griffith she is asleep good wench let's sit down quiet
 for fear we wake her softly gentle patience
 the vision enter solemnly tripping one after
 another six personages clad in white robes
 wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden
 vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in
 their hands they first congee unto her then
 dance and at certain changes the first two hold
 a spare garland over her head at which the other
 four make reverent curtsies then the two that held
 the garland deliver the same to the other next two
 who observe the same order in their changes and
 holding the garland over her head which done
 they deliver the same garland to the last two who
 likewise observe the same order at which as it
 were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs
 of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven
 and so in their dancing vanish carrying the
 garland with them the music continues
katharine spirits of peace where are ye are ye all gone
 and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye
griffith madam we are here
katharine it is not you i call for
 saw ye none enter since i slept
griffith none madam
katharine no saw you not even now a blessed troop
 invite me to a banquet whose bright faces
 cast thousand beams upon me like the sun
 they promised me eternal happiness
 and brought me garlands griffith which i feel
 i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly
griffith i am most joyful madam such good dreams
 possess your fancy
katharine bid the music leave
 they are harsh and heavy to me
 music ceases
patience do you note
 how much her grace is alter'd on the sudden
 how long her face is drawn how pale she looks
 and of an earthy cold mark her eyes
griffith she is going wench pray pray
patience heaven comfort her
 enter a messenger
messenger an't like your grace
katharine you are a saucy fellow
 deserve we no more reverence
griffith you are to blame
 knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness
 to use so rude behavior go to kneel
messenger i humbly do entreat your highness pardon
 my haste made me unmannerly there is staying
 a gentleman sent from the king to see you
katharine admit him entrance griffith but this fellow
 let me ne'er see again
 exeunt griffith and messenger
 reenter griffith with capucius
 if my sight fail not
 you should be lord ambassador from the emperor
 my royal nephew and your name capucius
capucius madam the same your servant
katharine o my lord
 the times and titles now are alter'd strangely
 with me since first you knew me but i pray you
 what is your pleasure with me
capucius noble lady
 first mine own service to your grace the next
 the king's request that i would visit you
 who grieves much for your weakness and by me
 sends you his princely commendations
 and heartily entreats you take good comfort
katharine o my good lord that comfort comes too late
 tis like a pardon after execution
 that gentle physic given in time had cured me
 but now i am past an comforts here but prayers
 how does his highness
capucius madam in good health
katharine so may he ever do and ever flourish
 when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name
 banish'd the kingdom patience is that letter
 i caused you write yet sent away
patience no madam
 giving it to katharine
katharine sir i most humbly pray you to deliver
 this to my lord the king
capucius most willing madam
katharine in which i have commended to his goodness
 the model of our chaste loves his young daughter
 the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her
 beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding
 she is young and of a noble modest nature
 i hope she will deserve welland a little
 to love her for her mother's sake that loved him
 heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition
 is that his noble grace would have some pity
 upon my wretched women that so long
 have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully
 of which there is not one i dare avow
 and now i should not lie but will deserve
 for virtue and true beauty of the soul
 for honesty and decent carriage
 a right good husband let him be a noble
 and sure those men are happy that shall have em
 the last is for my men they are the poorest
 but poverty could never draw em from me
 that they may have their wages duly paid em
 and something over to remember me by
 if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
 and able means we had not parted thus
 these are the whole contents and good my lord
 by that you love the dearest in this world
 as you wish christian peace to souls departed
 stand these poor people's friend and urge the king
 to do me this last right
capucius by heaven i will
 or let me lose the fashion of a man
katharine i thank you honest lord remember me
 in all humility unto his highness
 say his long trouble now is passing
 out of this world tell him in death i bless'd him
 for so i will mine eyes grow dim farewell
 my lord griffith farewell nay patience
 you must not leave me yet i must to bed
 call in more women when i am dead good wench
 let me be used with honour strew me over
 with maiden flowers that all the world may know
 i was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me
 then lay me forth although unqueen'd yet like
 a queen and daughter to a king inter me
 i can no more

 ah my good lord i grieve at what i speak
 and am right sorry to repeat what follows
 i have and most unwillingly of late
 heard many grievous i do say my lord
 grievous complaints of you which being consider'd
 have moved us and our council that you shall
 this morning come before us where i know
 you cannot with such freedom purge yourself
 but that till further trial in those charges
 which will require your answer you must take
 your patience to you and be well contented
 to make your house our tower you a brother of us

 would come against you
cranmer kneeling

 keep comfort to you and this morning see

scene iii the councilchamber
 enter chancellor places himself at the upper end
 of the table on the left hand a seat being left
 void above him as for cranmer's seat suffolk
 norfolk surrey chamberlain gardiner seat
 themselves in order on each side cromwell at
 lower end as secretary keeper at the door
chancellor speak to the business mastersecretary
 why are we met in council
cromwell please your honours
 the chief cause concerns his grace of canterbury
gardiner has he had knowledge of it
cromwell yes
norfolk who waits there
keeper without my noble lords
gardiner yes
keeper my lord archbishop
 and has done half an hour to know your pleasures
chancellor let him come in
keeper your grace may enter now
 cranmer enters and approaches the counciltable
chancellor my good lord archbishop i'm very sorry
 to sit here at this present and behold
 that chair stand empty but we all are men
 in our own natures frail and capable
 of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
 and want of wisdom you that best should teach us
 have misdemean'd yourself and not a little
 toward the king first then his laws in filling
 the whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains
 for so we are inform'd with new opinions
 divers and dangerous which are heresies
 and not reform'd may prove pernicious
gardiner which reformation must be sudden too
 my noble lords for those that tame wild horses
 pace em not in their hands to make em gentle
 but stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur em
 till they obey the manage if we suffer
 out of our easiness and childish pity
 to one man's honour this contagious sickness
 farewell all physic and what follows then
 commotions uproars with a general taint
 of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
 the upper germany can dearly witness
 yet freshly pitied in our memories
cranmer my good lords hitherto in all the progress
 both of my life and office i have labour'd
 and with no little study that my teaching
 and the strong course of my authority
 might go one way and safely and the end
 was ever to do well nor is there living
 i speak it with a single heart my lords
 a man that more detests more stirs against
 both in his private conscience and his place
 defacers of a public peace than i do
 pray heaven the king may never find a heart
 with less allegiance in it men that make
 envy and crooked malice nourishment
 dare bite the best i do beseech your lordships
 that in this case of justice my accusers
 be what they will may stand forth face to face
 and freely urge against me
suffolk nay my lord
 that cannot be you are a counsellor
 and by that virtue no man dare accuse you
gardiner my lord because we have business of more moment
 we will be short with you tis his highness pleasure
 and our consent for better trial of you
 from hence you be committed to the tower
 where being but a private man again
 you shall know many dare accuse you boldly
 more than i fear you are provided for
cranmer ah my good lord of winchester i thank you
 you are always my good friend if your will pass
 i shall both find your lordship judge and juror
 you are so merciful i see your end
 tis my undoing love and meekness lord
 become a churchman better than ambition
 win straying souls with modesty again
 cast none away that i shall clear myself
 lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
 i make as little doubt as you do conscience
 in doing daily wrongs i could say more
 but reverence to your calling makes me modest
gardiner my lord my lord you are a sectary
 that's the plain truth your painted gloss discovers
 to men that understand you words and weakness
cromwell my lord of winchester you are a little
 by your good favour too sharp men so noble
 however faulty yet should find respect
 for what they have been tis a cruelty
 to load a falling man
gardiner good master secretary
 i cry your honour mercy you may worst
 of all this table say so
cromwell why my lord
gardiner do not i know you for a favourer
 of this new sect ye are not sound
cromwell not sound
gardiner not sound i say
cromwell would you were half so honest
 men's prayers then would seek you not their fears
gardiner i shall remember this bold language
cromwell do
 remember your bold life too
chancellor this is too much
 forbear for shame my lords
gardiner i have done
cromwell and i
chancellor then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
 i take it by all voices that forthwith
 you be convey'd to the tower a prisoner
 there to remain till the king's further pleasure
 be known unto us are you all agreed lords
all we are
cranmer is there no other way of mercy
 but i must needs to the tower my lords
gardiner what other
 would you expect you are strangely troublesome
 let some o the guard be ready there
 enter guard
cranmer for me
 must i go like a traitor thither
gardiner receive him
 and see him safe i the tower
cranmer stay good my lords
 i have a little yet to say look there my lords
 by virtue of that ring i take my cause
 out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
 to a most noble judge the king my master
chamberlain this is the king's ring
surrey tis no counterfeit
suffolk tis the right ring by heaven i told ye all
 when ye first put this dangerous stone arolling
 twould fall upon ourselves
norfolk do you think my lords
 the king will suffer but the little finger
 of this man to be vex'd
chancellor tis now too certain
 how much more is his life in value with him
 would i were fairly out on't
cromwell my mind gave me
 in seeking tales and informations
 against this man whose honesty the devil
 and his disciples only envy at
 ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at ye
 enter king frowning on them takes his seat
gardiner dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
 in daily thanks that gave us such a prince
 not only good and wise but most religious
 one that in all obedience makes the church
 the chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
 that holy duty out of dear respect
 his royal self in judgment comes to hear
 the cause betwixt her and this great offender
king henry viii you were ever good at sudden commendations
 bishop of winchester but know i come not
 to hear such flattery now and in my presence
 they are too thin and bare to hide offences
 to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
 and think with wagging of your tongue to win me
 but whatsoe'er thou takest me for i'm sure
 thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
 to cranmer
 good man sit down now let me see the proudest
 he that dares most but wag his finger at thee
 by all that's holy he had better starve
 than but once think this place becomes thee not
surrey may it please your grace
king henry viii no sir it does not please me
 i had thought i had had men of some understanding
 and wisdom of my council but i find none
 was it discretion lords to let this man
 this good manfew of you deserve that title
 this honest man wait like a lousy footboy
 at chamberdoor and one as great as you are
 why what a shame was this did my commission
 bid ye so far forget yourselves i gave ye
 power as he was a counsellor to try him
 not as a groom there's some of ye i see
 more out of malice than integrity
 would try him to the utmost had ye mean
 which ye shall never have while i live
chancellor thus far
 my most dread sovereign may it like your grace
 to let my tongue excuse all what was purposed
 concerning his imprisonment was rather
 if there be faith in men meant for his trial
 and fair purgation to the world than malice
 i'm sure in me
king henry viii well well my lords respect him
 take him and use him well he's worthy of it
 i will say thus much for him if a prince
 may be beholding to a subject i
 am for his love and service so to him
 make me no more ado but all embrace him
 be friends for shame my lords my lord of
 canterbury
 i have a suit which you must not deny me
 that is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism
 you must be godfather and answer for her
cranmer the greatest monarch now alive may glory
 in such an honour how may i deserve it
 that am a poor and humble subject to you
king henry viii come come my lord you'ld spare your spoons you
 shall have two noble partners with you the old
 duchess of norfolk and lady marquess dorset will
 these please you
 once more my lord of winchester i charge you
 embrace and love this man
gardiner with a true heart
 and brotherlove i do it
cranmer and let heaven
 witness how dear i hold this confirmation
king henry viii good man those joyful tears show thy true heart
 the common voice i see is verified
 of thee which says thus do my lord of canterbury
 a shrewd turn and he is your friend for ever'
 come lords we trifle time away i long
 to have this young one made a christian
 as i have made ye one lords one remain
 so i grow stronger you more honour gain

 wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked
 porringer fell off her head for kindling such a
 combustion in the state i missed the meteor once
 and hit that woman who cried out clubs when i
 might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to
 her succor which were the hope o the strand where
 she was quartered they fell on i made good my
 place at length they came to the broomstaff to
 me i defied em still when suddenly a file of
 boys behind em loose shot delivered such a shower
 of pebbles that i was fain to draw mine honour in
 and let em win the work the devil was amongst

porter these are the youths that thunder at a playhouse
 and fight for bitten apples that no audience but
 the tribulation of towerhill or the limbs of
 limehouse their dear brothers are able to endure

 are like to dance these three days besides the
 running banquet of two beadles that is to come

 great store of room no doubt left for the ladies

 nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when
 the bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix
 her ashes new create another heir

 when heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness
 who from the sacred ashes of her honour
 shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was
 and so stand fix'd peace plenty love truth terror

 a most unspotted lily shall she pass
 to the ground and all the world shall mourn her
king henry viii o lord archbishop
 thou hast made me now a man never before
 this happy child did i get any thing
 this oracle of comfort has so pleased me
 that when i am in heaven i shall desire
 to see what this child does and praise my maker
 i thank ye all to you my good lord mayor
 and your good brethren i am much beholding
 i have received much honour by your presence
 and ye shall find me thankful lead the way lords

 all that are here some come to take their ease
 and sleep an act or two but those we fear
 we have frighted with our trumpets so tis clear
 they'll say tis naught others to hear the city
 abused extremely and to cry that's witty'
 which we have not done neither that i fear
 all the expected good we're like to hear
 for this play at this time is only in
 the merciful construction of good women
 for such a one we show'd em if they smile
 and say twill do i know within a while
 all the best men are ours for tis ill hap

queen elinor what now my son have i not ever said
 how that ambitious constance would not cease
 till she had kindled france and all the world
 upon the right and party of her son
 this might have been prevented and made whole
 with very easy arguments of love
 which now the manage of two kingdoms must
 with fearful bloody issue arbitrate
king john our strong possession and our right for us
queen elinor your strong possession much more than your right
 or else it must go wrong with you and me
 so much my conscience whispers in your ear
 which none but heaven and you and i shall hear
 enter a sheriff
essex my liege here is the strangest controversy
 come from country to be judged by you
 that e'er i heard shall i produce the men
king john let them approach
 our abbeys and our priories shall pay
 this expedition's charge
 enter robert and the bastard
 what men are you
bastard your faithful subject i a gentleman
 born in northamptonshire and eldest son
 as i suppose to robert faulconbridge
 a soldier by the honourgiving hand
 of coeurdelion knighted in the field
king john what art thou
robert the son and heir to that same faulconbridge
king john is that the elder and art thou the heir
 you came not of one mother then it seems
bastard most certain of one mother mighty king
 that is well known and as i think one father
 but for the certain knowledge of that truth
 i put you o'er to heaven and to my mother
 of that i doubt as all men's children may
queen elinor out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother
 and wound her honour with this diffidence
bastard i madam no i have no reason for it
 that is my brother's plea and none of mine
 the which if he can prove a pops me out
 at least from fair five hundred pound a year
 heaven guard my mother's honour and my land
king john a good blunt fellow why being younger born
 doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
bastard i know not why except to get the land
 but once he slander'd me with bastardy
 but whether i be as true begot or no
 that still i lay upon my mother's head
 but that i am as well begot my liege
 fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
 compare our faces and be judge yourself
 if old sir robert did beget us both
 and were our father and this son like him
 o old sir robert father on my knee
 i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee
king john why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
queen elinor he hath a trick of coeurdelion's face
 the accent of his tongue affecteth him
 do you not read some tokens of my son
 in the large composition of this man
king john mine eye hath well examined his parts
 and finds them perfect richard sirrah speak
 what doth move you to claim your brother's land
bastard because he hath a halfface like my father
 with half that face would he have all my land
 a halffaced groat five hundred pound a year
robert my gracious liege when that my father lived
 your brother did employ my father much
bastard well sir by this you cannot get my land
 your tale must be how he employ'd my mother
robert and once dispatch'd him in an embassy
 to germany there with the emperor
 to treat of high affairs touching that time
 the advantage of his absence took the king
 and in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's
 where how he did prevail i shame to speak
 but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
 between my father and my mother lay
 as i have heard my father speak himself
 when this same lusty gentleman was got
 upon his deathbed he by will bequeath'd
 his lands to me and took it on his death
 that this my mother's son was none of his
 and if he were he came into the world
 full fourteen weeks before the course of time
 then good my liege let me have what is mine
 my father's land as was my father's will
king john sirrah your brother is legitimate
 your father's wife did after wedlock bear him
 and if she did play false the fault was hers
 which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
 that marry wives tell me how if my brother
 who as you say took pains to get this son
 had of your father claim'd this son for his
 in sooth good friend your father might have kept
 this calf bred from his cow from all the world
 in sooth he might then if he were my brother's
 my brother might not claim him nor your father
 being none of his refuse him this concludes
 my mother's son did get your father's heir
 your father's heir must have your father's land
robert shall then my father's will be of no force
 to dispossess that child which is not his
bastard of no more force to dispossess me sir
 than was his will to get me as i think
queen elinor whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge
 and like thy brother to enjoy thy land
 or the reputed son of coeurdelion
 lord of thy presence and no land beside
bastard madam an if my brother had my shape
 and i had his sir robert's his like him
 and if my legs were two such ridingrods
 my arms such eelskins stuff'd my face so thin
 that in mine ear i durst not stick a rose
 lest men should say look where threefarthings goes'
 and to his shape were heir to all this land
 would i might never stir from off this place
 i would give it every foot to have this face
 i would not be sir nob in any case
queen elinor i like thee well wilt thou forsake thy fortune
 bequeath thy land to him and follow me
 i am a soldier and now bound to france
bastard brother take you my land i'll take my chance
 your face hath got five hundred pound a year
 yet sell your face for five pence and tis dear
 madam i'll follow you unto the death
queen elinor nay i would have you go before me thither

 my picked man of countries my dear sir'
 thus leaning on mine elbow i begin

 and then comes answer like an absey book
 o sir says answer at your best command
 at your employment at your service sir'
 no sir says question i sweet sir at yours'
 and so ere answer knows what question would
 saving in dialogue of compliment
 and talking of the alps and apennines
 the pyrenean and the river po
 it draws toward supper in conclusion so
 but this is worshipful society
 and fits the mounting spirit like myself
 for he is but a bastard to the time
 that doth not smack of observation
 and so am i whether i smack or no
 and not alone in habit and device
 exterior form outward accoutrement
 but from the inward motion to deliver
 sweet sweet sweet poison for the age's tooth
 which though i will not practise to deceive
 yet to avoid deceit i mean to learn
 for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
 but who comes in such haste in ridingrobes
 what womanpost is this hath she no husband
 that will take pains to blow a horn before her

lady faulconbridge hast thou conspired with thy brother too
 that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour

lady faulconbridge hast thou denied thyself a faulconbridge
bastard as faithfully as i deny the devil
lady faulconbridge king richard coeurdelion was thy father

 to make room for him in my husband's bed
 heaven lay not my transgression to my charge

act ii
scene i france before angiers
 enter austria and forces drums etc on one side
 on the other king philip and his power lewis
 arthur constance and attendants
lewis before angiers well met brave austria
 arthur that great forerunner of thy blood
 richard that robb'd the lion of his heart
 and fought the holy wars in palestine
 by this brave duke came early to his grave
 and for amends to his posterity
 at our importance hither is he come
 to spread his colours boy in thy behalf
 and to rebuke the usurpation
 of thy unnatural uncle english john
 embrace him love him give him welcome hither
arthur god shall forgive you coeurdelion's death
 the rather that you give his offspring life
 shadowing their right under your wings of war
 i give you welcome with a powerless hand
 but with a heart full of unstained love
 welcome before the gates of angiers duke
lewis a noble boy who would not do thee right
austria upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss
 as seal to this indenture of my love
 that to my home i will no more return
 till angiers and the right thou hast in france
 together with that pale that whitefaced shore
 whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
 and coops from other lands her islanders
 even till that england hedged in with the main
 that waterwalled bulwark still secure
 and confident from foreign purposes
 even till that utmost corner of the west
 salute thee for her king till then fair boy
 will i not think of home but follow arms
constance o take his mother's thanks a widow's thanks
 till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
 to make a more requital to your love
austria the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
 in such a just and charitable war
king philip well then to work our cannon shall be bent
 against the brows of this resisting town
 call for our chiefest men of discipline
 to cull the plots of best advantages
 we'll lay before this town our royal bones
 wade to the marketplace in frenchmen's blood
 but we will make it subject to this boy
constance stay for an answer to your embassy
 lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood
 my lord chatillon may from england bring
 that right in peace which here we urge in war
 and then we shall repent each drop of blood
 that hot rash haste so indirectly shed
 enter chatillon
king philip a wonder lady lo upon thy wish
 our messenger chatillon is arrived
 what england says say briefly gentle lord
 we coldly pause for thee chatillon speak
chatillon then turn your forces from this paltry siege
 and stir them up against a mightier task
 england impatient of your just demands
 hath put himself in arms the adverse winds
 whose leisure i have stay'd have given him time
 to land his legions all as soon as i
 his marches are expedient to this town
 his forces strong his soldiers confident
 with him along is come the motherqueen
 an ate stirring him to blood and strife
 with her her niece the lady blanch of spain
 with them a bastard of the king's deceased
 and all the unsettled humours of the land
 rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
 with ladies faces and fierce dragons spleens
 have sold their fortunes at their native homes
 bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
 to make hazard of new fortunes here
 in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
 than now the english bottoms have waft o'er
 did nearer float upon the swelling tide
 to do offence and scath in christendom
 drum beats
 the interruption of their churlish drums
 cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
 to parley or to fight therefore prepare
king philip how much unlook'd for is this expedition
austria by how much unexpected by so much
 we must awake endavour for defence
 for courage mounteth with occasion
 let them be welcome then we are prepared
 enter king john queen elinor blanch the bastard
 lords and forces
king john peace be to france if france in peace permit
 our just and lineal entrance to our own
 if not bleed france and peace ascend to heaven
 whiles we god's wrathful agent do correct
 their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven
king philip peace be to england if that war return
 from france to england there to live in peace
 england we love and for that england's sake
 with burden of our armour here we sweat
 this toil of ours should be a work of thine
 but thou from loving england art so far
 that thou hast underwrought his lawful king
 cut off the sequence of posterity
 outfaced infant state and done a rape
 upon the maiden virtue of the crown
 look here upon thy brother geffrey's face
 these eyes these brows were moulded out of his
 this little abstract doth contain that large
 which died in geffrey and the hand of time
 shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
 that geffrey was thy elder brother born
 and this his son england was geffrey's right
 and this is geffrey's in the name of god
 how comes it then that thou art call'd a king
 when living blood doth in these temples beat
 which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest
king john from whom hast thou this great commission france
 to draw my answer from thy articles
king philip from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
 in any breast of strong authority
 to look into the blots and stains of right
 that judge hath made me guardian to this boy
 under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong
 and by whose help i mean to chastise it
king john alack thou dost usurp authority
king philip excuse it is to beat usurping down
queen elinor who is it thou dost call usurper france
constance let me make answer thy usurping son
queen elinor out insolent thy bastard shall be king
 that thou mayst be a queen and cheque the world
constance my bed was ever to thy son as true
 as thine was to thy husband and this boy
 liker in feature to his father geffrey
 than thou and john in manners being as like
 as rain to water or devil to his dam
 my boy a bastard by my soul i think
 his father never was so true begot
 it cannot be an if thou wert his mother
queen elinor there's a good mother boy that blots thy father
constance there's a good grandam boy that would blot thee
austria peace
bastard hear the crier
austria what the devil art thou
bastard one that will play the devil sir with you
 an a may catch your hide and you alone
 you are the hare of whom the proverb goes
 whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard
 i'll smoke your skincoat an i catch you right
 sirrah look to't i faith i will i faith
blanch o well did he become that lion's robe
 that did disrobe the lion of that robe
bastard it lies as sightly on the back of him
 as great alcides shows upon an ass
 but ass i'll take that burthen from your back
 or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
austria what craker is this same that deafs our ears
 with this abundance of superfluous breath
king philip lewis determine what we shall do straight
lewis women and fools break off your conference
 king john this is the very sum of all
 england and ireland anjou touraine maine
 in right of arthur do i claim of thee
 wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms
king john my life as soon i do defy thee france
 arthur of bretagne yield thee to my hand
 and out of my dear love i'll give thee more
 than e'er the coward hand of france can win
 submit thee boy
queen elinor come to thy grandam child
constance do child go to it grandam child
 give grandam kingdom and it grandam will
 give it a plum a cherry and a fig
 there's a good grandam
arthur good my mother peace
 i would that i were low laid in my grave
 i am not worth this coil that's made for me
queen elinor his mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
constance now shame upon you whether she does or no
 his grandam's wrongs and not his mother's shames
 draws those heavenmoving pearls from his poor eyes
 which heaven shall take in nature of a fee
 ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
 to do him justice and revenge on you
queen elinor thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth
constance thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth
 call not me slanderer thou and thine usurp
 the dominations royalties and rights
 of this oppressed boy this is thy eld'st son's son
 infortunate in nothing but in thee
 thy sins are visited in this poor child
 the canon of the law is laid on him
 being but the second generation
 removed from thy sinconceiving womb
king john bedlam have done
constance i have but this to say
 that he is not only plagued for her sin
 but god hath made her sin and her the plague
 on this removed issue plague for her
 and with her plague her sin his injury
 her injury the beadle to her sin
 all punish'd in the person of this child
 and all for her a plague upon her
queen elinor thou unadvised scold i can produce
 a will that bars the title of thy son
constance ay who doubts that a will a wicked will
 a woman's will a canker'd grandam's will
king philip peace lady pause or be more temperate
 it ill beseems this presence to cry aim
 to these illtuned repetitions
 some trumpet summon hither to the walls
 these men of angiers let us hear them speak
 whose title they admit arthur's or john's
 trumpet sounds enter certain citizens upon the walls
first citizen who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls
king philip tis france for england
king john england for itself
 you men of angiers and my loving subjects
king philip you loving men of angiers arthur's subjects
 our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle
king john for our advantage therefore hear us first
 these flags of france that are advanced here
 before the eye and prospect of your town
 have hither march'd to your endamagement
 the cannons have their bowels full of wrath
 and ready mounted are they to spit forth
 their iron indignation gainst your walls
 all preparation for a bloody siege
 all merciless proceeding by these french
 confronts your city's eyes your winking gates
 and but for our approach those sleeping stones
 that as a waist doth girdle you about
 by the compulsion of their ordinance
 by this time from their fixed beds of lime
 had been dishabited and wide havoc made
 for bloody power to rush upon your peace
 but on the sight of us your lawful king
 who painfully with much expedient march
 have brought a countercheque before your gates
 to save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks
 behold the french amazed vouchsafe a parle
 and now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire
 to make a shaking fever in your walls
 they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
 to make a faithless error in your ears
 which trust accordingly kind citizens
 and let us in your king whose labour'd spirits
 forwearied in this action of swift speed
 crave harbourage within your city walls
king philip when i have said make answer to us both
 lo in this right hand whose protection
 is most divinely vow'd upon the right
 of him it holds stands young plantagenet
 son to the elder brother of this man
 and king o'er him and all that he enjoys
 for this downtrodden equity we tread
 in warlike march these greens before your town
 being no further enemy to you
 than the constraint of hospitable zeal
 in the relief of this oppressed child
 religiously provokes be pleased then
 to pay that duty which you truly owe
 to that owes it namely this young prince
 and then our arms like to a muzzled bear
 save in aspect hath all offence seal'd up
 our cannons malice vainly shall be spent
 against the invulnerable clouds of heaven
 and with a blessed and unvex'd retire
 with unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised
 we will bear home that lusty blood again
 which here we came to spout against your town
 and leave your children wives and you in peace
 but if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer
 tis not the roundure of your oldfaced walls
 can hide you from our messengers of war
 though all these english and their discipline
 were harbour'd in their rude circumference
 then tell us shall your city call us lord
 in that behalf which we have challenged it
 or shall we give the signal to our rage
 and stalk in blood to our possession
first citizen in brief we are the king of england's subjects
 for him and in his right we hold this town
king john acknowledge then the king and let me in
first citizen that can we not but he that proves the king
 to him will we prove loyal till that time
 have we ramm'd up our gates against the world
king john doth not the crown of england prove the king
 and if not that i bring you witnesses
 twice fifteen thousand hearts of england's breed
bastard bastards and else
king john to verify our title with their lives
king philip as many and as wellborn bloods as those
bastard some bastards too
king philip stand in his face to contradict his claim
first citizen till you compound whose right is worthiest
 we for the worthiest hold the right from both
king john then god forgive the sin of all those souls
 that to their everlasting residence
 before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
 in dreadful trial of our kingdom's king
king philip amen amen mount chevaliers to arms
bastard saint george that swinged the dragon and e'er since
 sits on his horseback at mine hostess door
 teach us some fence
 to austria
 sirrah were i at home
 at your den sirrah with your lioness
 i would set an oxhead to your lion's hide
 and make a monster of you
austria peace no more
bastard o tremble for you hear the lion roar
king john up higher to the plain where we'll set forth
 in best appointment all our regiments
bastard speed then to take advantage of the field
king philip it shall be so and at the other hill
 command the rest to stand god and our right
 exeunt
 here after excursions enter the herald of france
 with trumpets to the gates
french herald you men of angiers open wide your gates
 and let young arthur duke of bretagne in
 who by the hand of france this day hath made
 much work for tears in many an english mother
 whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
 many a widow's husband grovelling lies
 coldly embracing the discolour'd earth
 and victory with little loss doth play
 upon the dancing banners of the french
 who are at hand triumphantly display'd
 to enter conquerors and to proclaim
 arthur of bretagne england's king and yours
 enter english herald with trumpet
english herald rejoice you men of angiers ring your bells
 king john your king and england's doth approach
 commander of this hot malicious day
 their armours that march'd hence so silverbright
 hither return all gilt with frenchmen's blood
 there stuck no plume in any english crest
 that is removed by a staff of france
 our colours do return in those same hands
 that did display them when we first march'd forth
 and like a troop of jolly huntsmen come
 our lusty english all with purpled hands
 dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes
 open your gates and gives the victors way
first citizen heralds from off our towers we might behold
 from first to last the onset and retire
 of both your armies whose equality
 by our best eyes cannot be censured
 blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows
 strength match'd with strength and power confronted power
 both are alike and both alike we like
 one must prove greatest while they weigh so even
 we hold our town for neither yet for both
 reenter king john and king philip with their
 powers severally
king john france hast thou yet more blood to cast away
 say shall the current of our right run on
 whose passage vex'd with thy impediment
 shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
 with course disturb'd even thy confining shores
 unless thou let his silver water keep
 a peaceful progress to the ocean
king philip england thou hast not saved one drop of blood
 in this hot trial more than we of france
 rather lost more and by this hand i swear
 that sways the earth this climate overlooks
 before we will lay down our justborne arms
 we'll put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear
 or add a royal number to the dead
 gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
 with slaughter coupled to the name of kings
bastard ha majesty how high thy glory towers
 when the rich blood of kings is set on fire
 o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel
 the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
 and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
 in undetermined differences of kings
 why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
 cry havoc kings back to the stained field
 you equal potents fiery kindled spirits
 then let confusion of one part confirm
 the other's peace till then blows blood and death
king john whose party do the townsmen yet admit
king philip speak citizens for england who's your king
first citizen the king of england when we know the king
king philip know him in us that here hold up his right
king john in us that are our own great deputy
 and bear possession of our person here
 lord of our presence angiers and of you
first citizen a greater power then we denies all this
 and till it be undoubted we do lock
 our former scruple in our strongbarr'd gates
 king'd of our fears until our fears resolved
 be by some certain king purged and deposed
bastard by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings
 and stand securely on their battlements
 as in a theatre whence they gape and point
 at your industrious scenes and acts of death
 your royal presences be ruled by me
 do like the mutines of jerusalem
 be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
 your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
 by east and west let france and england mount
 their battering cannon charged to the mouths
 till their soulfearing clamours have brawl'd down
 the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
 i'ld play incessantly upon these jades
 even till unfenced desolation
 leave them as naked as the vulgar air
 that done dissever your united strengths
 and part your mingled colours once again
 turn face to face and bloody point to point
 then in a moment fortune shall cull forth
 out of one side her happy minion
 to whom in favour she shall give the day
 and kiss him with a glorious victory
 how like you this wild counsel mighty states
 smacks it not something of the policy
king john now by the sky that hangs above our heads
 i like it well france shall we knit our powers
 and lay this angiers even to the ground
 then after fight who shall be king of it
bastard an if thou hast the mettle of a king
 being wronged as we are by this peevish town
 turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
 as we will ours against these saucy walls
 and when that we have dash'd them to the ground
 why then defy each other and pellmell
 make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
king philip let it be so say where will you assault
king john we from the west will send destruction
 into this city's bosom
austria i from the north
king philip our thunder from the south
 shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
bastard o prudent discipline from north to south
 austria and france shoot in each other's mouth
 i'll stir them to it come away away
first citizen hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
 and i shall show you peace and fairfaced league
 win you this city without stroke or wound
 rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
 that here come sacrifices for the field
 persever not but hear me mighty kings
king john speak on with favour we are bent to hear
first citizen that daughter there of spain the lady blanch
 is niece to england look upon the years
 of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid
 if lusty love should go in quest of beauty
 where should he find it fairer than in blanch
 if zealous love should go in search of virtue
 where should he find it purer than in blanch
 if love ambitious sought a match of birth
 whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch
 such as she is in beauty virtue birth
 is the young dauphin every way complete
 if not complete of say he is not she
 and she again wants nothing to name want
 if want it be not that she is not he
 he is the half part of a blessed man
 left to be finished by such as she
 and she a fair divided excellence
 whose fulness of perfection lies in him
 o two such silver currents when they join
 do glorify the banks that bound them in
 and two such shores to two such streams made one
 two such controlling bounds shall you be kings
 to these two princes if you marry them
 this union shall do more than battery can
 to our fastclosed gates for at this match
 with swifter spleen than powder can enforce
 the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
 and give you entrance but without this match
 the sea enraged is not half so deaf
 lions more confident mountains and rocks
 more free from motion no not death himself
 in moral fury half so peremptory
 as we to keep this city
bastard here's a stay
 that shakes the rotten carcass of old death
 out of his rags here's a large mouth indeed
 that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
 talks as familiarly of roaring lions
 as maids of thirteen do of puppydogs
 what cannoneer begot this lusty blood
 he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce
 he gives the bastinado with his tongue
 our ears are cudgell'd not a word of his
 but buffets better than a fist of france
 zounds i was never so bethump'd with words
 since i first call'd my brother's father dad
queen elinor son list to this conjunction make this match
 give with our niece a dowry large enough
 for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
 thy now unsured assurance to the crown
 that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
 the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
 i see a yielding in the looks of france
 mark how they whisper urge them while their souls
 are capable of this ambition
 lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
 of soft petitions pity and remorse
 cool and congeal again to what it was
first citizen why answer not the double majesties
 this friendly treaty of our threaten'd town
king philip speak england first that hath been forward first
 to speak unto this city what say you
king john if that the dauphin there thy princely son
 can in this book of beauty read i love'
 her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
 for anjou and fair touraine maine poictiers
 and all that we upon this side the sea
 except this city now by us besieged
 find liable to our crown and dignity
 shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
 in titles honours and promotions
 as she in beauty education blood
 holds hand with any princess of the world
king philip what say'st thou boy look in the lady's face
lewis i do my lord and in her eye i find
 a wonder or a wondrous miracle
 the shadow of myself form'd in her eye
 which being but the shadow of your son
 becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
 i do protest i never loved myself
 till now infixed i beheld myself
 drawn in the flattering table of her eye
 whispers with blanch
bastard drawn in the flattering table of her eye
 hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
 and quarter'd in her heart he doth espy
 himself love's traitor this is pity now
 that hang'd and drawn and quartered there should be
 in such a love so vile a lout as he
blanch my uncle's will in this respect is mine
 if he see aught in you that makes him like
 that any thing he sees which moves his liking
 i can with ease translate it to my will
 or if you will to speak more properly
 i will enforce it easily to my love
 further i will not flatter you my lord
 that all i see in you is worthy love
 than this that nothing do i see in you
 though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
 that i can find should merit any hate
king john what say these young ones what say you my niece
blanch that she is bound in honour still to do
 what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
king john speak then prince dauphin can you love this lady
lewis nay ask me if i can refrain from love
 for i do love her most unfeignedly
king john then do i give volquessen touraine maine
 poictiers and anjou these five provinces
 with her to thee and this addition more
 full thirty thousand marks of english coin
 philip of france if thou be pleased withal
 command thy son and daughter to join hands
king philip it likes us well young princes close your hands
austria and your lips too for i am well assured
 that i did so when i was first assured
king philip now citizens of angiers ope your gates
 let in that amity which you have made
 for at saint mary's chapel presently
 the rites of marriage shall be solemnized
 is not the lady constance in this troop
 i know she is not for this match made up
 her presence would have interrupted much
 where is she and her son tell me who knows
lewis she is sad and passionate at your highness tent
king philip and by my faith this league that we have made
 will give her sadness very little cure
 brother of england how may we content
 this widow lady in her right we came
 which we god knows have turn'd another way
 to our own vantage
king john we will heal up all
 for we'll create young arthur duke of bretagne
 and earl of richmond and this rich fair town
 we make him lord of call the lady constance
 some speedy messenger bid her repair
 to our solemnity i trust we shall
 if not fill up the measure of her will
 yet in some measure satisfy her so
 that we shall stop her exclamation
 go we as well as haste will suffer us
 to this unlook'd for unprepared pomp
 exeunt all but the bastard
bastard mad world mad kings mad composition
 john to stop arthur's title in the whole
 hath willingly departed with a part
 and france whose armour conscience buckled on
 whom zeal and charity brought to the field
 as god's own soldier rounded in the ear
 with that same purposechanger that sly devil
 that broker that still breaks the pate of faith
 that daily breakvow he that wins of all
 of kings of beggars old men young men maids
 who having no external thing to lose
 but the word maid cheats the poor maid of that
 that smoothfaced gentleman tickling commodity
 commodity the bias of the world
 the world who of itself is peised well
 made to run even upon even ground
 till this advantage this viledrawing bias
 this sway of motion this commodity
 makes it take head from all indifferency
 from all direction purpose course intent
 and this same bias this commodity
 this bawd this broker this allchanging word
 clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle france
 hath drawn him from his own determined aid
 from a resolved and honourable war
 to a most base and vileconcluded peace
 and why rail i on this commodity
 but for because he hath not woo'd me yet
 not that i have the power to clutch my hand
 when his fair angels would salute my palm
 but for my hand as unattempted yet
 like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
 well whiles i am a beggar i will rail
 and say there is no sin but to be rich
 and being rich my virtue then shall be
 to say there is no vice but beggary
 since kings break faith upon commodity
 gain be my lord for i will worship thee

 false blood to false blood join'd gone to be friends
 shall lewis have blanch and blanch those provinces
 it is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
 be well advised tell o'er thy tale again
 it cannot be thou dost but say tis so
 i trust i may not trust thee for thy word
 is but the vain breath of a common man
 believe me i do not believe thee man
 i have a king's oath to the contrary
 thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me
 for i am sick and capable of fears
 oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
 a widow husbandless subject to fears
 a woman naturally born to fears
 and though thou now confess thou didst but jest
 with my vex'd spirits i cannot take a truce
 but they will quake and tremble all this day
 what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
 why dost thou look so sadly on my son
 what means that hand upon that breast of thine
 why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
 like a proud river peering o'er his bounds
 be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
 then speak again not all thy former tale
 but this one word whether thy tale be true
salisbury as true as i believe you think them false
 that give you cause to prove my saying true
constance o if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
 teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
 and let belief and life encounter so
 as doth the fury of two desperate men
 which in the very meeting fall and die
 lewis marry blanch o boy then where art thou
 france friend with england what becomes of me
 fellow be gone i cannot brook thy sight
 this news hath made thee a most ugly man
salisbury what other harm have i good lady done
 but spoke the harm that is by others done
constance which harm within itself so heinous is
 as it makes harmful all that speak of it
arthur i do beseech you madam be content
constance if thou that bid'st me be content wert grim
 ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb
 full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
 lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
 patch'd with foul moles and eyeoffending marks
 i would not care i then would be content
 for then i should not love thee no nor thou
 become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
 but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
 nature and fortune join'd to make thee great
 of nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
 and with the halfblown rose but fortune o
 she is corrupted changed and won from thee
 she adulterates hourly with thine uncle john
 and with her golden hand hath pluck'd on france
 to tread down fair respect of sovereignty
 and made his majesty the bawd to theirs
 france is a bawd to fortune and king john
 that strumpet fortune that usurping john
 tell me thou fellow is not france forsworn
 envenom him with words or get thee gone
 and leave those woes alone which i alone
 am bound to underbear
salisbury pardon me madam
 i may not go without you to the kings
constance thou mayst thou shalt i will not go with thee
 i will instruct my sorrows to be proud
 for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
 to me and to the state of my great grief
 let kings assemble for my grief's so great
 that no supporter but the huge firm earth
 can hold it up here i and sorrows sit
 here is my throne bid kings come bow to it
 seats herself on the ground
 enter king john king phillip lewis blanch
 queen elinor the bastard austria and attendants
king philip tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
 ever in france shall be kept festival
 to solemnize this day the glorious sun
 stays in his course and plays the alchemist
 turning with splendor of his precious eye
 the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
 the yearly course that brings this day about
 shall never see it but a holiday
constance a wicked day and not a holy day
 rising
 what hath this day deserved what hath it done
 that it in golden letters should be set
 among the high tides in the calendar
 nay rather turn this day out of the week
 this day of shame oppression perjury
 or if it must stand still let wives with child
 pray that their burthens may not fall this day
 lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd
 but on this day let seamen fear no wreck
 no bargains break that are not this day made
 this day all things begun come to ill end
 yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
king philip by heaven lady you shall have no cause
 to curse the fair proceedings of this day
 have i not pawn'd to you my majesty
constance you have beguiled me with a counterfeit
 resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried
 proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
 you came in arms to spill mine enemies blood
 but now in arms you strengthen it with yours
 the grappling vigour and rough frown of war
 is cold in amity and painted peace
 and our oppression hath made up this league
 arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings
 a widow cries be husband to me heavens
 let not the hours of this ungodly day
 wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
 set armed discord twixt these perjured kings
 hear me o hear me
austria lady constance peace
constance war war no peace peace is to me a war
 o lymoges o austria thou dost shame
 that bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward
 thou little valiant great in villany
 thou ever strong upon the stronger side
 thou fortune's champion that dost never fight
 but when her humorous ladyship is by
 to teach thee safety thou art perjured too
 and soothest up greatness what a fool art thou
 a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
 upon my party thou coldblooded slave
 hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
 been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
 upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
 and dost thou now fall over to my fores
 thou wear a lion's hide doff it for shame
 and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
austria o that a man should speak those words to me
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
austria thou darest not say so villain for thy life
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
king john we like not this thou dost forget thyself
 enter cardinal pandulph
king philip here comes the holy legate of the pope
cardinal pandulph hail you anointed deputies of heaven
 to thee king john my holy errand is
 i pandulph of fair milan cardinal
 and from pope innocent the legate here
 do in his name religiously demand
 why thou against the church our holy mother
 so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
 keep stephen langton chosen archbishop
 of canterbury from that holy see
 this in our foresaid holy father's name
 pope innocent i do demand of thee
king john what earthy name to interrogatories
 can task the free breath of a sacred king
 thou canst not cardinal devise a name
 so slight unworthy and ridiculous
 to charge me to an answer as the pope
 tell him this tale and from the mouth of england
 add thus much more that no italian priest
 shall tithe or toll in our dominions
 but as we under heaven are supreme head
 so under him that great supremacy
 where we do reign we will alone uphold
 without the assistance of a mortal hand
 so tell the pope all reverence set apart
 to him and his usurp'd authority
king philip brother of england you blaspheme in this
king john though you and all the kings of christendom
 are led so grossly by this meddling priest
 dreading the curse that money may buy out
 and by the merit of vile gold dross dust
 purchase corrupted pardon of a man
 who in that sale sells pardon from himself
 though you and all the rest so grossly led
 this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
 yet i alone alone do me oppose
 against the pope and count his friends my foes
cardinal pandulph then by the lawful power that i have
 thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate
 and blessed shall he be that doth revolt
 from his allegiance to an heretic
 and meritorious shall that hand be call'd
 canonized and worshipped as a saint
 that takes away by any secret course
 thy hateful life
constance o lawful let it be
 that i have room with rome to curse awhile
 good father cardinal cry thou amen
 to my keen curses for without my wrong
 there is no tongue hath power to curse him right
cardinal pandulph there's law and warrant lady for my curse
constance and for mine too when law can do no right
 let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
 law cannot give my child his kingdom here
 for he that holds his kingdom holds the law
 therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
 how can the law forbid my tongue to curse
cardinal pandulph philip of france on peril of a curse
 let go the hand of that archheretic
 and raise the power of france upon his head
 unless he do submit himself to rome
queen elinor look'st thou pale france do not let go thy hand
constance look to that devil lest that france repent
 and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
austria king philip listen to the cardinal
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on his recreant limbs
austria well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs because
bastard your breeches best may carry them
king john philip what say'st thou to the cardinal
constance what should he say but as the cardinal
lewis bethink you father for the difference
 is purchase of a heavy curse from rome
 or the light loss of england for a friend
 forego the easier
blanch that's the curse of rome
constance o lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here
 in likeness of a new untrimmed bride
blanch the lady constance speaks not from her faith
 but from her need
constance o if thou grant my need
 which only lives but by the death of faith
 that need must needs infer this principle
 that faith would live again by death of need
 o then tread down my need and faith mounts up
 keep my need up and faith is trodden down
king john the king is moved and answers not to this
constance o be removed from him and answer well
austria do so king philip hang no more in doubt
bastard hang nothing but a calf'sskin most sweet lout
king philip i am perplex'd and know not what to say
cardinal pandulph what canst thou say but will perplex thee more
 if thou stand excommunicate and cursed
king philip good reverend father make my person yours
 and tell me how you would bestow yourself
 this royal hand and mine are newly knit
 and the conjunction of our inward souls
 married in league coupled and linked together
 with all religious strength of sacred vows
 the latest breath that gave the sound of words
 was deepsworn faith peace amity true love
 between our kingdoms and our royal selves
 and even before this truce but new before
 no longer than we well could wash our hands
 to clap this royal bargain up of peace
 heaven knows they were besmear'd and overstain'd
 with slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint
 the fearful difference of incensed kings
 and shall these hands so lately purged of blood
 so newly join'd in love so strong in both
 unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
 play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
 make such unconstant children of ourselves
 as now again to snatch our palm from palm
 unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed
 of smiling peace to march a bloody host
 and make a riot on the gentle brow
 of true sincerity o holy sir
 my reverend father let it not be so
 out of your grace devise ordain impose
 some gentle order and then we shall be blest
 to do your pleasure and continue friends
cardinal pandulph all form is formless order orderless
 save what is opposite to england's love
 therefore to arms be champion of our church
 or let the church our mother breathe her curse
 a mother's curse on her revolting son
 france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
 a chafed lion by the mortal paw
 a fasting tiger safer by the tooth
 than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
king philip i may disjoin my hand but not my faith
cardinal pandulph so makest thou faith an enemy to faith
 and like a civil war set'st oath to oath
 thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow
 first made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd
 that is to be the champion of our church
 what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
 and may not be performed by thyself
 for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
 is not amiss when it is truly done
 and being not done where doing tends to ill
 the truth is then most done not doing it
 the better act of purposes mistook
 is to mistake again though indirect
 yet indirection thereby grows direct
 and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire
 within the scorched veins of one newburn'd
 it is religion that doth make vows kept
 but thou hast sworn against religion
 by what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st
 and makest an oath the surety for thy truth
 against an oath the truth thou art unsure
 to swear swears only not to be forsworn
 else what a mockery should it be to swear
 but thou dost swear only to be forsworn
 and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
 therefore thy later vows against thy first
 is in thyself rebellion to thyself
 and better conquest never canst thou make
 than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
 against these giddy loose suggestions
 upon which better part our prayers come in
 if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know
 the peril of our curses light on thee
 so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
 but in despair die under their black weight
austria rebellion flat rebellion
bastard will't not be
 will not a calfsskin stop that mouth of thine
lewis father to arms
blanch upon thy weddingday
 against the blood that thou hast married
 what shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men
 shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
 clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
 o husband hear me ay alack how new
 is husband in my mouth even for that name
 which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce
 upon my knee i beg go not to arms
 against mine uncle
constance o upon my knee
 made hard with kneeling i do pray to thee
 thou virtuous dauphin alter not the doom
 forethought by heaven
blanch now shall i see thy love what motive may
 be stronger with thee than the name of wife
constance that which upholdeth him that thee upholds
 his honour o thine honour lewis thine honour
lewis i muse your majesty doth seem so cold
 when such profound respects do pull you on
cardinal pandulph i will denounce a curse upon his head
king philip thou shalt not need england i will fall from thee
constance o fair return of banish'd majesty
queen elinor o foul revolt of french inconstancy
king john france thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
bastard old time the clocksetter that bald sexton time
 is it as he will well then france shall rue
blanch the sun's o'ercast with blood fair day adieu
 which is the side that i must go withal
 i am with both each army hath a hand
 and in their rage i having hold of both
 they swirl asunder and dismember me
 husband i cannot pray that thou mayst win
 uncle i needs must pray that thou mayst lose
 father i may not wish the fortune thine
 grandam i will not wish thy fortunes thrive
 whoever wins on that side shall i lose
 assured loss before the match be play'd
lewis lady with me with me thy fortune lies
blanch there where my fortune lives there my life dies
king john cousin go draw our puissance together
 exit bastard
 france i am burn'd up with inflaming wrath
 a rage whose heat hath this condition
 that nothing can allay nothing but blood

 to ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire
 look to thyself thou art in jeopardy

 we owe thee much within this wall of flesh
 there is a soul counts thee her creditor
 and with advantage means to pay thy love
 and my good friend thy voluntary oath
 lives in this bosom dearly cherished
 give me thy hand i had a thing to say
 but i will fit it with some better time
 by heaven hubert i am almost ashamed
 to say what good respect i have of thee
hubert i am much bounden to your majesty
king john good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
 but thou shalt have and creep time ne'er so slow
 yet it shall come from me to do thee good
 i had a thing to say but let it go
 the sun is in the heaven and the proud day
 attended with the pleasures of the world
 is all too wanton and too full of gawds
 to give me audience if the midnight bell
 did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
 sound on into the drowsy race of night
 if this same were a churchyard where we stand
 and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
 or if that surly spirit melancholy
 had baked thy blood and made it heavythick
 which else runs tickling up and down the veins
 making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes
 and strain their cheeks to idle merriment
 a passion hateful to my purposes
 or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
 hear me without thine ears and make reply
 without a tongue using conceit alone
 without eyes ears and harmful sound of words
 then in despite of brooded watchful day
 i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
 but ah i will not yet i love thee well
 and by my troth i think thou lovest me well
hubert so well that what you bid me undertake
 though that my death were adjunct to my act
 by heaven i would do it
king john do not i know thou wouldst
 good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye
 on yon young boy i'll tell thee what my friend
 he is a very serpent in my way
 and whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread
 he lies before me dost thou understand me
 thou art his keeper
hubert and i'll keep him so
 that he shall not offend your majesty
king john death
hubert my lord
king john a grave
hubert he shall not live
king john enough
 i could be merry now hubert i love thee
 well i'll not say what i intend for thee

act iii
scene iv the same king philip's tent
 enter king philip lewis cardinal pandulph
 and attendants
king philip so by a roaring tempest on the flood
 a whole armado of convicted sail
 is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship
cardinal pandulph courage and comfort all shall yet go well
king philip what can go well when we have run so ill
 are we not beaten is not angiers lost
 arthur ta'en prisoner divers dear friends slain
 and bloody england into england gone
 o'erbearing interruption spite of france
lewis what he hath won that hath he fortified
 so hot a speed with such advice disposed
 such temperate order in so fierce a cause
 doth want example who hath read or heard
 of any kindred action like to this
king philip well could i bear that england had this praise
 so we could find some pattern of our shame
 enter constance
 look who comes here a grave unto a soul
 holding the eternal spirit against her will
 in the vile prison of afflicted breath
 i prithee lady go away with me
constance lo now i now see the issue of your peace
king philip patience good lady comfort gentle constance
constance no i defy all counsel all redress
 but that which ends all counsel true redress
 death death o amiable lovely death
 thou odouriferous stench sound rottenness
 arise forth from the couch of lasting night
 thou hate and terror to prosperity
 and i will kiss thy detestable bones
 and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
 and ring these fingers with thy household worms
 and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
 and be a carrion monster like thyself
 come grin on me and i will think thou smilest
 and buss thee as thy wife misery's love
 o come to me
king philip o fair affliction peace
constance no no i will not having breath to cry
 o that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth
 then with a passion would i shake the world
 and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
 which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice
 which scorns a modern invocation
cardinal pandulph lady you utter madness and not sorrow
constance thou art not holy to belie me so
 i am not mad this hair i tear is mine
 my name is constance i was geffrey's wife
 young arthur is my son and he is lost
 i am not mad i would to heaven i were
 for then tis like i should forget myself
 o if i could what grief should i forget
 preach some philosophy to make me mad
 and thou shalt be canonized cardinal
 for being not mad but sensible of grief
 my reasonable part produces reason
 how i may be deliver'd of these woes
 and teaches me to kill or hang myself
 if i were mad i should forget my son
 or madly think a babe of clouts were he
 i am not mad too well too well i feel
 the different plague of each calamity
king philip bind up those tresses o what love i note
 in the fair multitude of those her hairs
 where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen
 even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
 do glue themselves in sociable grief
 like true inseparable faithful loves
 sticking together in calamity
constance to england if you will
king philip bind up your hairs
constance yes that i will and wherefore will i do it
 i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
 o that these hands could so redeem my son
 as they have given these hairs their liberty'
 but now i envy at their liberty
 and will again commit them to their bonds
 because my poor child is a prisoner
 and father cardinal i have heard you say
 that we shall see and know our friends in heaven
 if that be true i shall see my boy again
 for since the birth of cain the first male child
 to him that did but yesterday suspire
 there was not such a gracious creature born
 but now will cankersorrow eat my bud
 and chase the native beauty from his cheek
 and he will look as hollow as a ghost
 as dim and meagre as an ague's fit
 and so he'll die and rising so again
 when i shall meet him in the court of heaven
 i shall not know him therefore never never
 must i behold my pretty arthur more
cardinal pandulph you hold too heinous a respect of grief
constance he talks to me that never had a son
king philip you are as fond of grief as of your child
constance grief fills the room up of my absent child
 lies in his bed walks up and down with me
 puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
 remembers me of all his gracious parts
 stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
 then have i reason to be fond of grief
 fare you well had you such a loss as i
 i could give better comfort than you do
 i will not keep this form upon my head
 when there is such disorder in my wit
 o lord my boy my arthur my fair son
 my life my joy my food my all the world
 my widowcomfort and my sorrows cure
 exit
king philip i fear some outrage and i'll follow her
 exit
lewis there's nothing in this world can make me joy
 life is as tedious as a twicetold tale
 vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
 and bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
 that it yields nought but shame and bitterness
cardinal pandulph before the curing of a strong disease
 even in the instant of repair and health
 the fit is strongest evils that take leave
 on their departure most of all show evil
 what have you lost by losing of this day
lewis all days of glory joy and happiness
cardinal pandulph if you had won it certainly you had
 no no when fortune means to men most good
 she looks upon them with a threatening eye
 tis strange to think how much king john hath lost
 in this which he accounts so clearly won
 are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner
lewis as heartily as he is glad he hath him
cardinal pandulph your mind is all as youthful as your blood
 now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
 for even the breath of what i mean to speak
 shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
 out of the path which shall directly lead
 thy foot to england's throne and therefore mark
 john hath seized arthur and it cannot be
 that whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins
 the misplaced john should entertain an hour
 one minute nay one quiet breath of rest
 a sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
 must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd
 and he that stands upon a slippery place
 makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
 that john may stand then arthur needs must fall
 so be it for it cannot be but so
lewis but what shall i gain by young arthur's fall
cardinal pandulph you in the right of lady blanch your wife
 may then make all the claim that arthur did
lewis and lose it life and all as arthur did
cardinal pandulph how green you are and fresh in this old world
 john lays you plots the times conspire with you
 for he that steeps his safety in true blood
 shall find but bloody safety and untrue
 this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
 of all his people and freeze up their zeal
 that none so small advantage shall step forth
 to cheque his reign but they will cherish it
 no natural exhalation in the sky
 no scope of nature no distemper'd day
 no common wind no customed event
 but they will pluck away his natural cause
 and call them meteors prodigies and signs
 abortives presages and tongues of heaven
 plainly denouncing vengeance upon john
lewis may be he will not touch young arthur's life
 but hold himself safe in his prisonment
cardinal pandulph o sir when he shall hear of your approach
 if that young arthur be not gone already
 even at that news he dies and then the hearts
 of all his people shall revolt from him
 and kiss the lips of unacquainted change
 and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
 out of the bloody fingers ends of john
 methinks i see this hurly all on foot
 and o what better matter breeds for you
 than i have named the bastard faulconbridge
 is now in england ransacking the church
 offending charity if but a dozen french
 were there in arms they would be as a call
 to train ten thousand english to their side
 or as a little snow tumbled about
 anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin
 go with me to the king tis wonderful
 what may be wrought out of their discontent
 now that their souls are topful of offence
 for england go i will whet on the king
lewis strong reasons make strong actions let us go
 if you say ay the king will not say no

act iv
scene i a room in a castle
 enter hubert and executioners
hubert heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
 within the arras when i strike my foot
 upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
 and bind the boy which you shall find with me
 fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch
first executioner i hope your warrant will bear out the deed
hubert uncleanly scruples fear not you look to't
 exeunt executioners
 young lad come forth i have to say with you
 enter arthur
arthur good morrow hubert
hubert good morrow little prince
arthur as little prince having so great a title
 to be more prince as may be you are sad
hubert indeed i have been merrier
arthur mercy on me
 methinks no body should be sad but i
 yet i remember when i was in france
 young gentlemen would be as sad as night
 only for wantonness by my christendom
 so i were out of prison and kept sheep
 i should be as merry as the day is long
 and so i would be here but that i doubt
 my uncle practises more harm to me
 he is afraid of me and i of him
 is it my fault that i was geffrey's son
 no indeed is't not and i would to heaven
 i were your son so you would love me hubert
hubert aside if i talk to him with his innocent prate
 he will awake my mercy which lies dead
 therefore i will be sudden and dispatch
arthur are you sick hubert you look pale today
 in sooth i would you were a little sick
 that i might sit all night and watch with you
 i warrant i love you more than you do me
hubert aside his words do take possession of my bosom
 read here young arthur
 showing a paper
 aside
 how now foolish rheum
 turning dispiteous torture out of door
 i must be brief lest resolution drop
 out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
 can you not read it is it not fair writ
arthur too fairly hubert for so foul effect
 must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
hubert young boy i must
arthur and will you
hubert and i will
arthur have you the heart when your head did but ache
 i knit my handercher about your brows
 the best i had a princess wrought it me
 and i did never ask it you again
 and with my hand at midnight held your head
 and like the watchful minutes to the hour
 still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time
 saying what lack you and where lies your grief'
 or what good love may i perform for you'
 many a poor man's son would have lien still
 and ne'er have spoke a loving word to you
 but you at your sick service had a prince
 nay you may think my love was crafty love
 and call it cunning do an if you will
 if heaven be pleased that you must use me ill
 why then you must will you put out mine eyes
 these eyes that never did nor never shall
 so much as frown on you
hubert i have sworn to do it
 and with hot irons must i burn them out
arthur ah none but in this iron age would do it
 the iron of itself though heat redhot
 approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
 and quench his fiery indignation
 even in the matter of mine innocence
 nay after that consume away in rust
 but for containing fire to harm mine eye
 are you more stubbornhard than hammer'd iron
 an if an angel should have come to me
 and told me hubert should put out mine eyes
 i would not have believed himno tongue but hubert's
hubert come forth
 stamps
 reenter executioners with a cord irons &c
 do as i bid you do
arthur o save me hubert save me my eyes are out
 even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
hubert give me the iron i say and bind him here
arthur alas what need you be so boisterousrough
 i will not struggle i will stand stonestill
 for heaven sake hubert let me not be bound
 nay hear me hubert drive these men away
 and i will sit as quiet as a lamb
 i will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
 nor look upon the iron angerly
 thrust but these men away and i'll forgive you
 whatever torment you do put me to
hubert go stand within let me alone with him
first executioner i am best pleased to be from such a deed
 exeunt executioners
arthur alas i then have chid away my friend
 he hath a stern look but a gentle heart
 let him come back that his compassion may
 give life to yours
hubert come boy prepare yourself
arthur is there no remedy
hubert none but to lose your eyes
arthur o heaven that there were but a mote in yours
 a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
 any annoyance in that precious sense
 then feeling what small things are boisterous there
 your vile intent must needs seem horrible
hubert is this your promise go to hold your tongue
arthur hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
 must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
 let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert
 or hubert if you will cut out my tongue
 so i may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes
 though to no use but still to look on you
 lo by my truth the instrument is cold
 and would not harm me
hubert i can heat it boy
arthur no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
 being create for comfort to be used
 in undeserved extremes see else yourself
 there is no malice in this burning coal
 the breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
 and strew'd repentent ashes on his head
hubert but with my breath i can revive it boy
arthur an if you do you will but make it blush
 and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert
 nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
 and like a dog that is compell'd to fight
 snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
 all things that you should use to do me wrong
 deny their office only you do lack
 that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
 creatures of note for mercylacking uses
hubert well see to live i will not touch thine eye
 for all the treasure that thine uncle owes
 yet am i sworn and i did purpose boy
 with this same very iron to burn them out
arthur o now you look like hubert all this while
 you were disguised
hubert peace no more adieu
 your uncle must not know but you are dead
 i'll fill these dogged spies with false reports
 and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
 that hubert for the wealth of all the world
 will not offend thee
arthur o heaven i thank you hubert
hubert silence no more go closely in with me
 much danger do i undergo for thee

 king john
act iv
scene ii king john's palace
 enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords
king john here once again we sit once again crown'd
 and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes
pembroke this once again but that your highness pleased
 was once superfluous you were crown'd before
 and that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off
 the faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt
 fresh expectation troubled not the land
 with any long'dfor change or better state
salisbury therefore to be possess'd with double pomp
 to guard a title that was rich before
 to gild refined gold to paint the lily
 to throw a perfume on the violet
 to smooth the ice or add another hue
 unto the rainbow or with taperlight
 to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
 is wasteful and ridiculous excess
pembroke but that your royal pleasure must be done
 this act is as an ancient tale new told
 and in the last repeating troublesome
 being urged at a time unseasonable
salisbury in this the antique and well noted face
 of plain old form is much disfigured
 and like a shifted wind unto a sail
 it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
 startles and frights consideration
 makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
 for putting on so new a fashion'd robe
pembroke when workmen strive to do better than well
 they do confound their skill in covetousness
 and oftentimes excusing of a fault
 doth make the fault the worse by the excuse
 as patches set upon a little breach
 discredit more in hiding of the fault
 than did the fault before it was so patch'd
salisbury to this effect before you were new crown'd
 we breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness
 to overbear it and we are all well pleased
 since all and every part of what we would
 doth make a stand at what your highness will
king john some reasons of this double coronation
 i have possess'd you with and think them strong
 and more more strong then lesser is my fear
 i shall indue you with meantime but ask
 what you would have reform'd that is not well
 and well shall you perceive how willingly
 i will both hear and grant you your requests
pembroke then i as one that am the tongue of these
 to sound the purpose of all their hearts
 both for myself and them but chief of all
 your safety for the which myself and them
 bend their best studies heartily request
 the enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint
 doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
 to break into this dangerous argument
 if what in rest you have in right you hold
 why then your fears which as they say attend
 the steps of wrong should move you to mew up
 your tender kinsman and to choke his days
 with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
 the rich advantage of good exercise
 that the time's enemies may not have this
 to grace occasions let it be our suit
 that you have bid us ask his liberty
 which for our goods we do no further ask
 than whereupon our weal on you depending
 counts it your weal he have his liberty
 enter hubert
king john let it be so i do commit his youth
 to your direction hubert what news with you
 taking him apart
pembroke this is the man should do the bloody deed
 he show'd his warrant to a friend of mine
 the image of a wicked heinous fault
 lives in his eye that close aspect of his
 does show the mood of a much troubled breast
 and i do fearfully believe tis done
 what we so fear'd he had a charge to do
salisbury the colour of the king doth come and go
 between his purpose and his conscience
 like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set
 his passion is so ripe it needs must break
pembroke and when it breaks i fear will issue thence
 the foul corruption of a sweet child's death
king john we cannot hold mortality's strong hand
 good lords although my will to give is living
 the suit which you demand is gone and dead
 he tells us arthur is deceased tonight
salisbury indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure
pembroke indeed we heard how near his death he was
 before the child himself felt he was sick
 this must be answer'd either here or hence
king john why do you bend such solemn brows on me
 think you i bear the shears of destiny
 have i commandment on the pulse of life
salisbury it is apparent foul play and tis shame
 that greatness should so grossly offer it
 so thrive it in your game and so farewell
pembroke stay yet lord salisbury i'll go with thee
 and find the inheritance of this poor child
 his little kingdom of a forced grave
 that blood which owed the breadth of all this isle
 three foot of it doth hold bad world the while
 this must not be thus borne this will break out
 to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt
 exeunt lords
king john they burn in indignation i repent
 there is no sure foundation set on blood
 no certain life achieved by others death
 enter a messenger
 a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
 that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks
 so foul a sky clears not without a storm
 pour down thy weather how goes all in france
messenger from france to england never such a power
 for any foreign preparation
 was levied in the body of a land
 the copy of your speed is learn'd by them
 for when you should be told they do prepare
 the tidings come that they are all arrived
king john o where hath our intelligence been drunk
 where hath it slept where is my mother's care
 that such an army could be drawn in france
 and she not hear of it
messenger my liege her ear
 is stopp'd with dust the first of april died
 your noble mother and as i hear my lord
 the lady constance in a frenzy died
 three days before but this from rumour's tongue
 i idly heard if true or false i know not
king john withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
 o make a league with me till i have pleased
 my discontented peers what mother dead
 how wildly then walks my estate in france
 under whose conduct came those powers of france
 that thou for truth givest out are landed here
messenger under the dauphin
king john thou hast made me giddy
 with these ill tidings
 enter the bastard and peter of pomfret
 now what says the world
 to your proceedings do not seek to stuff
 my head with more ill news for it is full
bastard but if you be afeard to hear the worst
 then let the worst unheard fall on your bead
king john bear with me cousin for i was amazed
 under the tide but now i breathe again
 aloft the flood and can give audience
 to any tongue speak it of what it will
bastard how i have sped among the clergymen
 the sums i have collected shall express
 but as i travell'd hither through the land
 i find the people strangely fantasied
 possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams
 not knowing what they fear but full of fear
 and here a prophet that i brought with me
 from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found
 with many hundreds treading on his heels
 to whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes
 that ere the next ascensionday at noon
 your highness should deliver up your crown
king john thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
peter foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
king john hubert away with him imprison him
 and on that day at noon whereon he says
 i shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd
 deliver him to safety and return
 for i must use thee
 exeunt hubert with peter
 o my gentle cousin
 hear'st thou the news abroad who are arrived
bastard the french my lord men's mouths are full of it
 besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury
 with eyes as red as newenkindled fire
 and others more going to seek the grave
 of arthur who they say is kill'd tonight
 on your suggestion
king john gentle kinsman go
 and thrust thyself into their companies
 i have a way to win their loves again
 bring them before me
bastard i will seek them out
king john nay but make haste the better foot before
 o let me have no subject enemies
 when adverse foreigners affright my towns
 with dreadful pomp of stout invasion
 be mercury set feathers to thy heels
 and fly like thought from them to me again
bastard the spirit of the time shall teach me speed
 exit
king john spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
 go after him for he perhaps shall need
 some messenger betwixt me and the peers
 and be thou he
messenger with all my heart my liege
 exit
king john my mother dead
 reenter hubert
hubert my lord they say five moons were seen tonight
 four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
 the other four in wondrous motion
king john five moons
hubert old men and beldams in the streets
 do prophesy upon it dangerously
 young arthur's death is common in their mouths
 and when they talk of him they shake their heads
 and whisper one another in the ear
 and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist
 whilst he that hears makes fearful action
 with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
 i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
 the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
 with open mouth swallowing a tailor's news
 who with his shears and measure in his hand
 standing on slippers which his nimble haste
 had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
 told of a many thousand warlike french
 that were embattailed and rank'd in kent
 another lean unwash'd artificer
 cuts off his tale and talks of arthur's death
king john why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears
 why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death
 thy hand hath murder'd him i had a mighty cause
 to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
hubert no had my lord why did you not provoke me
king john it is the curse of kings to be attended
 by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
 to break within the bloody house of life
 and on the winking of authority
 to understand a law to know the meaning
 of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
 more upon humour than advised respect
hubert here is your hand and seal for what i did
king john o when the last account twixt heaven and earth
 is to be made then shall this hand and seal
 witness against us to damnation
 how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
 make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by
 a fellow by the hand of nature mark'd
 quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame
 this murder had not come into my mind
 but taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect
 finding thee fit for bloody villany
 apt liable to be employ'd in danger
 i faintly broke with thee of arthur's death
 and thou to be endeared to a king
 made it no conscience to destroy a prince
hubert my lord
king john hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
 when i spake darkly what i purposed
 or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face
 as bid me tell my tale in express words
 deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
 and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
 but thou didst understand me by my signs
 and didst in signs again parley with sin
 yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
 and consequently thy rude hand to act
 the deed which both our tongues held vile to name
 out of my sight and never see me more
 my nobles leave me and my state is braved
 even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers
 nay in the body of this fleshly land
 this kingdom this confine of blood and breath
 hostility and civil tumult reigns
 between my conscience and my cousin's death
hubert arm you against your other enemies
 i'll make a peace between your soul and you
 young arthur is alive this hand of mine
 is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
 not painted with the crimson spots of blood
 within this bosom never enter'd yet
 the dreadful motion of a murderous thought
 and you have slander'd nature in my form
 which howsoever rude exteriorly
 is yet the cover of a fairer mind
 than to be butcher of an innocent child
king john doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers
 throw this report on their incensed rage
 and make them tame to their obedience
 forgive the comment that my passion made
 upon thy feature for my rage was blind
 and foul imaginary eyes of blood
 presented thee more hideous than thou art
 o answer not but to my closet bring
 the angry lords with all expedient haste
 i conjure thee but slowly run more fast
 exeunt
 king john
act iv
scene iii before the castle
 enter arthur on the walls
arthur the wall is high and yet will i leap down
 good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
 there's few or none do know me if they did
 this shipboy's semblance hath disguised me quite
 i am afraid and yet i'll venture it
 if i get down and do not break my limbs
 i'll find a thousand shifts to get away
 as good to die and go as die and stay
 leaps down
 o me my uncle's spirit is in these stones
 heaven take my soul and england keep my bones
 dies
 enter pembroke salisbury and bigot
salisbury lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury
 it is our safety and we must embrace
 this gentle offer of the perilous time
pembroke who brought that letter from the cardinal
salisbury the count melun a noble lord of france
 whose private with me of the dauphin's love
 is much more general than these lines import
bigot tomorrow morning let us meet him then
salisbury or rather then set forward for twill be
 two long days journey lords or ere we meet
 enter the bastard
bastard once more today well met distemper'd lords
 the king by me requests your presence straight
salisbury the king hath dispossess'd himself of us
 we will not line his thin bestained cloak
 with our pure honours nor attend the foot
 that leaves the print of blood where'er it walks
 return and tell him so we know the worst
bastard whate'er you think good words i think were best
salisbury our griefs and not our manners reason now
bastard but there is little reason in your grief
 therefore twere reason you had manners now
pembroke sir sir impatience hath his privilege
bastard tis true to hurt his master no man else
salisbury this is the prison what is he lies here
 seeing arthur
pembroke o death made proud with pure and princely beauty
 the earth had not a hole to hide this deed
salisbury murder as hating what himself hath done
 doth lay it open to urge on revenge
bigot or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave
 found it too preciousprincely for a grave
salisbury sir richard what think you have you beheld
 or have you read or heard or could you think
 or do you almost think although you see
 that you do see could thought without this object
 form such another this is the very top
 the height the crest or crest unto the crest
 of murder's arms this is the bloodiest shame
 the wildest savagery the vilest stroke
 that ever walleyed wrath or staring rage
 presented to the tears of soft remorse
pembroke all murders past do stand excused in this
 and this so sole and so unmatchable
 shall give a holiness a purity
 to the yet unbegotten sin of times
 and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
 exampled by this heinous spectacle
bastard it is a damned and a bloody work
 the graceless action of a heavy hand
 if that it be the work of any hand
salisbury if that it be the work of any hand
 we had a kind of light what would ensue
 it is the shameful work of hubert's hand
 the practise and the purpose of the king
 from whose obedience i forbid my soul
 kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
 and breathing to his breathless excellence
 the incense of a vow a holy vow
 never to taste the pleasures of the world
 never to be infected with delight
 nor conversant with ease and idleness
 till i have set a glory to this hand
 by giving it the worship of revenge
pembroke 
 our souls religiously confirm thy words
bigot 
 enter hubert
hubert lords i am hot with haste in seeking you
 arthur doth live the king hath sent for you
salisbury o he is old and blushes not at death
 avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone
hubert i am no villain
salisbury must i rob the law
 drawing his sword
bastard your sword is bright sir put it up again
salisbury not till i sheathe it in a murderer's skin
hubert stand back lord salisbury stand back i say
 by heaven i think my sword's as sharp as yours
 i would not have you lord forget yourself
 nor tempt the danger of my true defence
 lest i by marking of your rage forget
 your worth your greatness and nobility
bigot out dunghill darest thou brave a nobleman
hubert not for my life but yet i dare defend
 my innocent life against an emperor
salisbury thou art a murderer
hubert do not prove me so
 yet i am none whose tongue soe'er speaks false
 not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies
pembroke cut him to pieces
bastard keep the peace i say
salisbury stand by or i shall gall you faulconbridge
bastard thou wert better gall the devil salisbury
 if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
 or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
 i'll strike thee dead put up thy sword betime
 or i'll so maul you and your toastingiron
 that you shall think the devil is come from hell
bigot what wilt thou do renowned faulconbridge
 second a villain and a murderer
hubert lord bigot i am none
bigot who kill'd this prince
hubert tis not an hour since i left him well
 i honour'd him i loved him and will weep
 my date of life out for his sweet life's loss
salisbury trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
 for villany is not without such rheum
 and he long traded in it makes it seem
 like rivers of remorse and innocency
 away with me all you whose souls abhor
 the uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse
 for i am stifled with this smell of sin
bigot away toward bury to the dauphin there
pembroke there tell the king he may inquire us out
 exeunt lords
bastard here's a good world knew you of this fair work
 beyond the infinite and boundless reach
 of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
 art thou damn'd hubert
hubert do but hear me sir
bastard ha i'll tell thee what
 thou'rt damn'd as blacknay nothing is so black
 thou art more deep damn'd than prince lucifer
 there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
 as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
hubert upon my soul
bastard if thou didst but consent
 to this most cruel act do but despair
 and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread
 that ever spider twisted from her womb
 will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
 to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
 put but a little water in a spoon
 and it shall be as all the ocean
 enough to stifle such a villain up
 i do suspect thee very grievously
hubert if i in act consent or sin of thought
 be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
 which was embounded in this beauteous clay
 let hell want pains enough to torture me
 i left him well
bastard go bear him in thine arms
 i am amazed methinks and lose my way
 among the thorns and dangers of this world
 how easy dost thou take all england up
 from forth this morsel of dead royalty
 the life the right and truth of all this realm
 is fled to heaven and england now is left
 to tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
 the unowed interest of proudswelling state
 now for the barepick'd bone of majesty
 doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
 and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
 now powers from home and discontents at home
 meet in one line and vast confusion waits
 as doth a raven on a sickfall'n beast
 the imminent decay of wrested pomp
 now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
 hold out this tempest bear away that child
 and follow me with speed i'll to the king
 a thousand businesses are brief in hand
 and heaven itself doth frown upon the land

act v
scene i king john's palace
 enter king john cardinal pandulph and attendants
king john thus have i yielded up into your hand
 the circle of my glory
 giving the crown
cardinal pandulph take again
 from this my hand as holding of the pope
 your sovereign greatness and authority
king john now keep your holy word go meet the french
 and from his holiness use all your power
 to stop their marches fore we are inflamed
 our discontented counties do revolt
 our people quarrel with obedience
 swearing allegiance and the love of soul
 to stranger blood to foreign royalty
 this inundation of mistemper'd humour
 rests by you only to be qualified
 then pause not for the present time's so sick
 that present medicine must be minister'd
 or overthrow incurable ensues
cardinal pandulph it was my breath that blew this tempest up
 upon your stubborn usage of the pope
 but since you are a gentle convertite
 my tongue shall hush again this storm of war
 and make fair weather in your blustering land
 on this ascensionday remember well
 upon your oath of service to the pope
 go i to make the french lay down their arms
 exit
king john is this ascensionday did not the prophet
 say that before ascensionday at noon
 my crown i should give off even so i have
 i did suppose it should be on constraint
 but heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary
 enter the bastard
bastard all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
 but dover castle london hath received
 like a kind host the dauphin and his powers
 your nobles will not hear you but are gone
 to offer service to your enemy
 and wild amazement hurries up and down
 the little number of your doubtful friends
king john would not my lords return to me again
 after they heard young arthur was alive
bastard they found him dead and cast into the streets
 an empty casket where the jewel of life
 by some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away
king john that villain hubert told me he did live
bastard so on my soul he did for aught he knew
 but wherefore do you droop why look you sad
 be great in act as you have been in thought
 let not the world see fear and sad distrust
 govern the motion of a kingly eye
 be stirring as the time be fire with fire
 threaten the threatener and outface the brow
 of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
 that borrow their behaviors from the great
 grow great by your example and put on
 the dauntless spirit of resolution
 away and glister like the god of war
 when he intendeth to become the field
 show boldness and aspiring confidence
 what shall they seek the lion in his den
 and fright him there and make him tremble there
 o let it not be said forage and run
 to meet displeasure farther from the doors
 and grapple with him ere he comes so nigh
king john the legate of the pope hath been with me
 and i have made a happy peace with him
 and he hath promised to dismiss the powers
 led by the dauphin
bastard o inglorious league
 shall we upon the footing of our land
 send fairplay orders and make compromise
 insinuation parley and base truce
 to arms invasive shall a beardless boy
 a cocker'd silken wanton brave our fields
 and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
 mocking the air with colours idly spread
 and find no cheque let us my liege to arms
 perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace
 or if he do let it at least be said
 they saw we had a purpose of defence
king john have thou the ordering of this present time
bastard away then with good courage yet i know
 our party may well meet a prouder foe
 exeunt

act v
scene ii lewis's camp at st edmundsbury
 enter in arms lewis salisbury melun pembroke
 bigot and soldiers
lewis my lord melun let this be copied out
 and keep it safe for our remembrance
 return the precedent to these lords again
 that having our fair order written down
 both they and we perusing o'er these notes
 may know wherefore we took the sacrament
 and keep our faiths firm and inviolable
salisbury upon our sides it never shall be broken
 and noble dauphin albeit we swear
 a voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
 to your proceedings yet believe me prince
 i am not glad that such a sore of time
 should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt
 and heal the inveterate canker of one wound
 by making many o it grieves my soul
 that i must draw this metal from my side
 to be a widowmaker o and there
 where honourable rescue and defence
 cries out upon the name of salisbury
 but such is the infection of the time
 that for the health and physic of our right
 we cannot deal but with the very hand
 of stern injustice and confused wrong
 and is't not pity o my grieved friends
 that we the sons and children of this isle
 were born to see so sad an hour as this
 wherein we step after a stranger march
 upon her gentle bosom and fill up
 her enemies ranksi must withdraw and weep
 upon the spot of this enforced cause
 to grace the gentry of a land remote
 and follow unacquainted colours here
 what here o nation that thou couldst remove
 that neptune's arms who clippeth thee about
 would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
 and grapple thee unto a pagan shore
 where these two christian armies might combine
 the blood of malice in a vein of league
 and not to spend it so unneighbourly
lewis a noble temper dost thou show in this
 and great affections wrestling in thy bosom
 doth make an earthquake of nobility
 o what a noble combat hast thou fought
 between compulsion and a brave respect
 let me wipe off this honourable dew
 that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
 my heart hath melted at a lady's tears
 being an ordinary inundation
 but this effusion of such manly drops
 this shower blown up by tempest of the soul
 startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed
 than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven
 figured quite o'er with burning meteors
 lift up thy brow renowned salisbury
 and with a great heart heave away the storm
 commend these waters to those baby eyes
 that never saw the giant world enraged
 nor met with fortune other than at feasts
 full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
 come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
 into the purse of rich prosperity
 as lewis himself so nobles shall you all
 that knit your sinews to the strength of mine
 and even there methinks an angel spake
 enter cardinal pandulph
 look where the holy legate comes apace
 to give us warrant from the hand of heaven
 and on our actions set the name of right
 with holy breath
cardinal pandulph hail noble prince of france
 the next is this king john hath reconciled
 himself to rome his spirit is come in
 that so stood out against the holy church
 the great metropolis and see of rome
 therefore thy threatening colours now wind up
 and tame the savage spirit of wild war
 that like a lion foster'd up at hand
 it may lie gently at the foot of peace
 and be no further harmful than in show
lewis your grace shall pardon me i will not back
 i am too highborn to be propertied
 to be a secondary at control
 or useful servingman and instrument
 to any sovereign state throughout the world
 your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
 between this chastised kingdom and myself
 and brought in matter that should feed this fire
 and now tis far too huge to be blown out
 with that same weak wind which enkindled it
 you taught me how to know the face of right
 acquainted me with interest to this land
 yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
 and come ye now to tell me john hath made
 his peace with rome what is that peace to me
 i by the honour of my marriagebed
 after young arthur claim this land for mine
 and now it is halfconquer'd must i back
 because that john hath made his peace with rome
 am i rome's slave what penny hath rome borne
 what men provided what munition sent
 to underprop this action is't not i
 that undergo this charge who else but i
 and such as to my claim are liable
 sweat in this business and maintain this war
 have i not heard these islanders shout out
 vive le roi as i have bank'd their towns
 have i not here the best cards for the game
 to win this easy match play'd for a crown
 and shall i now give o'er the yielded set
 no no on my soul it never shall be said
cardinal pandulph you look but on the outside of this work
lewis outside or inside i will not return
 till my attempt so much be glorified
 as to my ample hope was promised
 before i drew this gallant head of war
 and cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
 to outlook conquest and to win renown
 even in the jaws of danger and of death
 trumpet sounds
 what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
 enter the bastard attended
bastard according to the fair play of the world
 let me have audience i am sent to speak
 my holy lord of milan from the king
 i come to learn how you have dealt for him
 and as you answer i do know the scope
 and warrant limited unto my tongue
cardinal pandulph the dauphin is too wilfulopposite
 and will not temporize with my entreaties
 he flatly says he'll not lay down his arms
bastard by all the blood that ever fury breathed
 the youth says well now hear our english king
 for thus his royalty doth speak in me
 he is prepared and reason too he should
 this apish and unmannerly approach
 this harness'd masque and unadvised revel
 this unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops
 the king doth smile at and is well prepared
 to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
 from out the circle of his territories
 that hand which had the strength even at your door
 to cudgel you and make you take the hatch
 to dive like buckets in concealed wells
 to crouch in litter of your stable planks
 to lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks
 to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
 in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
 even at the crying of your nation's crow
 thinking his voice an armed englishman
 shall that victorious hand be feebled here
 that in your chambers gave you chastisement
 no know the gallant monarch is in arms
 and like an eagle o'er his aery towers
 to souse annoyance that comes near his nest
 and you degenerate you ingrate revolts
 you bloody neroes ripping up the womb
 of your dear mother england blush for shame
 for your own ladies and palevisaged maids
 like amazons come tripping after drums
 their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
 their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
 to fierce and bloody inclination
lewis there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
 we grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well
 we hold our time too precious to be spent
 with such a brabbler
cardinal pandulph give me leave to speak
bastard no i will speak
lewis we will attend to neither
 strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
 plead for our interest and our being here
bastard indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
 and so shall you being beaten do but start
 an echo with the clamour of thy drum
 and even at hand a drum is ready braced
 that shall reverberate all as loud as thine
 sound but another and another shall
 as loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
 and mock the deepmouth'd thunder for at hand
 not trusting to this halting legate here
 whom he hath used rather for sport than need
 is warlike john and in his forehead sits
 a bareribb'd death whose office is this day

 enter salisbury pembroke and bigot
salisbury i did not think the king so stored with friends
pembroke up once again put spirit in the french
 if they miscarry we miscarry too
salisbury that misbegotten devil faulconbridge
 in spite of spite alone upholds the day
pembroke they say king john sore sick hath left the field
 enter melun wounded
melun lead me to the revolts of england here
salisbury when we were happy we had other names
pembroke it is the count melun
salisbury wounded to death
melun fly noble english you are bought and sold
 unthread the rude eye of rebellion
 and welcome home again discarded faith
 seek out king john and fall before his feet
 for if the french be lords of this loud day
 he means to recompense the pains you take
 by cutting off your heads thus hath he sworn
 and i with him and many moe with me
 upon the altar at saint edmundsbury
 even on that altar where we swore to you
 dear amity and everlasting love
salisbury may this be possible may this be true
melun have i not hideous death within my view
 retaining but a quantity of life
 which bleeds away even as a form of wax
 resolveth from his figure gainst the fire
 what in the world should make me now deceive
 since i must lose the use of all deceit
 why should i then be false since it is true
 that i must die here and live hence by truth
 i say again if lewis do win the day
 he is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
 behold another day break in the east
 but even this night whose black contagious breath
 already smokes about the burning crest
 of the old feeble and daywearied sun
 even this ill night your breathing shall expire
 paying the fine of rated treachery
 even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
 if lewis by your assistance win the day
 commend me to one hubert with your king
 the love of him and this respect besides
 for that my grandsire was an englishman
 awakes my conscience to confess all this
 in lieu whereof i pray you bear me hence
 from forth the noise and rumour of the field
 where i may think the remnant of my thoughts
 in peace and part this body and my soul
 with contemplation and devout desires
salisbury we do believe thee and beshrew my soul
 but i do love the favour and the form
 of this most fair occasion by the which
 we will untread the steps of damned flight
 and like a bated and retired flood
 leaving our rankness and irregular course
 stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
 and cabby run on in obedience
 even to our ocean to our great king john
 my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
 for i do see the cruel pangs of death
 right in thine eye away my friends new flight
 and happy newness that intends old right

lewis the sun of heaven methought was loath to set
 but stay'd and made the western welkin blush
 when english measure backward their own ground
 in faint retire o bravely came we off
 when with a volley of our needless shot
 after such bloody toil we bid good night
 and wound our tattering colours clearly up
 last in the field and almost lords of it
 enter a messenger
messenger where is my prince the dauphin
lewis here what news
messenger the count melun is slain the english lords
 by his persuasion are again fall'n off
 and your supply which you have wish'd so long
 are cast away and sunk on goodwin sands
lewis ah foul shrewd news beshrew thy very heart
 i did not think to be so sad tonight
 as this hath made me who was he that said
 king john did fly an hour or two before
 the stumbling night did part our weary powers

 thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well

hubert the king i fear is poison'd by a monk
 i left him almost speechless and broke out
 to acquaint you with this evil that you might
 the better arm you to the sudden time
 than if you had at leisure known of this
bastard how did he take it who did taste to him
hubert a monk i tell you a resolved villain
 whose bowels suddenly burst out the king
 yet speaks and peradventure may recover
bastard who didst thou leave to tend his majesty
hubert why know you not the lords are all come back
 and brought prince henry in their company
 at whose request the king hath pardon'd them
 and they are all about his majesty
bastard withhold thine indignation mighty heaven

scene vii the orchard in swinstead abbey
 enter prince henry salisbury and bigot
prince henry it is too late the life of all his blood
 is touch'd corruptibly and his pure brain
 which some suppose the soul's frail dwellinghouse
 doth by the idle comments that it makes
 foretell the ending of mortality
 enter pembroke
pembroke his highness yet doth speak and holds belief
 that being brought into the open air
 it would allay the burning quality
 of that fell poison which assaileth him
prince henry let him be brought into the orchard here
 doth he still rage
 exit bigot
pembroke he is more patient
 than when you left him even now he sung
prince henry o vanity of sickness fierce extremes
 in their continuance will not feel themselves
 death having prey'd upon the outward parts
 leaves them invisible and his siege is now
 against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
 with many legions of strange fantasies
 which in their throng and press to that last hold
 confound themselves tis strange that death
 should sing
 i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
 who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
 and from the organpipe of frailty sings
 his soul and body to their lasting rest
salisbury be of good comfort prince for you are born
 to set a form upon that indigest
 which he hath left so shapeless and so rude
 enter attendants and bigot carrying king john in a chair
king john ay marry now my soul hath elbowroom
 it would not out at windows nor at doors
 there is so hot a summer in my bosom
 that all my bowels crumble up to dust
 i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
 upon a parchment and against this fire
 do i shrink up
prince henry how fares your majesty
king john poison'dill faredead forsook cast off
 and none of you will bid the winter come
 to thrust his icy fingers in my maw
 nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
 through my burn'd bosom nor entreat the north
 to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
 and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much
 i beg cold comfort and you are so strait
 and so ingrateful you deny me that
prince henry o that there were some virtue in my tears
 that might relieve you
king john the salt in them is hot
 within me is a hell and there the poison
 is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
 on unreprievable condemned blood
 enter the bastard
bastard o i am scalded with my violent motion
 and spleen of speed to see your majesty
king john o cousin thou art come to set mine eye
 the tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd
 and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
 are turned to one thread one little hair
 my heart hath one poor string to stay it by
 which holds but till thy news be uttered
 and then all this thou seest is but a clod
 and module of confounded royalty
bastard the dauphin is preparing hitherward
 where heaven he knows how we shall answer him
 for in a night the best part of my power
 as i upon advantage did remove
 were in the washes all unwarily
 devoured by the unexpected flood
 king john dies
salisbury you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
 my liege my lord but now a king now thus
prince henry even so must i run on and even so stop
 what surety of the world what hope what stay
 when this was now a king and now is clay
bastard art thou gone so i do but stay behind
 to do the office for thee of revenge
 and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
 as it on earth hath been thy servant still
 now now you stars that move in your right spheres
 where be your powers show now your mended faiths
 and instantly return with me again
 to push destruction and perpetual shame
 out of the weak door of our fainting land
 straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
 the dauphin rages at our very heels
salisbury it seems you know not then so much as we
 the cardinal pandulph is within at rest
 who half an hour since came from the dauphin
 and brings from him such offers of our peace
 as we with honour and respect may take
 with purpose presently to leave this war
bastard he will the rather do it when he sees
 ourselves well sinewed to our defence
salisbury nay it is in a manner done already
 for many carriages he hath dispatch'd
 to the seaside and put his cause and quarrel
 to the disposing of the cardinal
 with whom yourself myself and other lords
 if you think meet this afternoon will post
 to consummate this business happily
bastard let it be so and you my noble prince
 with other princes that may best be spared
 shall wait upon your father's funeral
prince henry at worcester must his body be interr'd
 for so he will'd it
bastard thither shall it then
 and happily may your sweet self put on
 the lineal state and glory of the land
 to whom with all submission on my knee
 i do bequeath my faithful services
 and true subjection everlastingly
salisbury and the like tender of our love we make
 to rest without a spot for evermore
prince henry i have a kind soul that would give you thanks
 and knows not how to do it but with tears
bastard o let us pay the time but needful woe
 since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
 this england never did nor never shall
 lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
 but when it first did help to wound itself
 now these her princes are come home again
 come the three corners of the world in arms
 and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue
 if england to itself do rest but true

 enter king richard ii john of gaunt with other
 nobles and attendants
king richard ii old john of gaunt timehonour'd lancaster
 hast thou according to thy oath and band
 brought hither henry hereford thy bold son
 here to make good the boisterous late appeal
 which then our leisure would not let us hear
 against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
john of gaunt i have my liege
king richard ii tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
 if he appeal the duke on ancient malice
 or worthily as a good subject should
 on some known ground of treachery in him
john of gaunt as near as i could sift him on that argument
 on some apparent danger seen in him
 aim'd at your highness no inveterate malice
king richard ii then call them to our presence face to face
 and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
 the accuser and the accused freely speak
 highstomach'd are they both and full of ire
 in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
 enter henry bolingbroke and thomas mowbray
henry bolingbroke many years of happy days befal
 my gracious sovereign my most loving liege
thomas mowbray each day still better other's happiness
 until the heavens envying earth's good hap
 add an immortal title to your crown
king richard ii we thank you both yet one but flatters us
 as well appeareth by the cause you come
 namely to appeal each other of high treason
 cousin of hereford what dost thou object
 against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
henry bolingbroke first heaven be the record to my speech
 in the devotion of a subject's love
 tendering the precious safety of my prince
 and free from other misbegotten hate
 come i appellant to this princely presence
 now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee
 and mark my greeting well for what i speak
 my body shall make good upon this earth
 or my divine soul answer it in heaven
 thou art a traitor and a miscreant
 too good to be so and too bad to live
 since the more fair and crystal is the sky
 the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
 once more the more to aggravate the note
 with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat
 and wish so please my sovereign ere i move
 what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove
thomas mowbray let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
 tis not the trial of a woman's war
 the bitter clamour of two eager tongues
 can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
 the blood is hot that must be cool'd for this
 yet can i not of such tame patience boast
 as to be hush'd and nought at all to say
 first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
 from giving reins and spurs to my free speech
 which else would post until it had return'd
 these terms of treason doubled down his throat
 setting aside his high blood's royalty
 and let him be no kinsman to my liege
 i do defy him and i spit at him
 call him a slanderous coward and a villain
 which to maintain i would allow him odds
 and meet him were i tied to run afoot
 even to the frozen ridges of the alps
 or any other ground inhabitable
 where ever englishman durst set his foot
 mean time let this defend my loyalty
 by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
henry bolingbroke pale trembling coward there i throw my gage
 disclaiming here the kindred of the king
 and lay aside my high blood's royalty
 which fear not reverence makes thee to except
 if guilty dread have left thee so much strength
 as to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop
 by that and all the rites of knighthood else
 will i make good against thee arm to arm
 what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise
thomas mowbray i take it up and by that sword i swear
 which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
 i'll answer thee in any fair degree
 or chivalrous design of knightly trial
 and when i mount alive may i not light
 if i be traitor or unjustly fight
king richard ii what doth our cousin lay to mowbray's charge
 it must be great that can inherit us
 so much as of a thought of ill in him
henry bolingbroke look what i speak my life shall prove it true
 that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
 in name of lendings for your highness soldiers
 the which he hath detain'd for lewd employments
 like a false traitor and injurious villain
 besides i say and will in battle prove
 or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
 that ever was survey'd by english eye
 that all the treasons for these eighteen years
 complotted and contrived in this land
 fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring
 further i say and further will maintain
 upon his bad life to make all this good
 that he did plot the duke of gloucester's death
 suggest his soonbelieving adversaries
 and consequently like a traitor coward
 sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood
 which blood like sacrificing abel's cries
 even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
 to me for justice and rough chastisement
 and by the glorious worth of my descent
 this arm shall do it or this life be spent
king richard ii how high a pitch his resolution soars
 thomas of norfolk what say'st thou to this
thomas mowbray o let my sovereign turn away his face
 and bid his ears a little while be deaf
 till i have told this slander of his blood
 how god and good men hate so foul a liar
king richard ii mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears
 were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir
 as he is but my father's brother's son
 now by my sceptre's awe i make a vow
 such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
 should nothing privilege him nor partialize
 the unstooping firmness of my upright soul
 he is our subject mowbray so art thou
 free speech and fearless i to thee allow
thomas mowbray then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
 through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
 three parts of that receipt i had for calais
 disbursed i duly to his highness soldiers
 the other part reserved i by consent
 for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
 upon remainder of a dear account
 since last i went to france to fetch his queen
 now swallow down that lie for gloucester's death
 i slew him not but to my own disgrace
 neglected my sworn duty in that case
 for you my noble lord of lancaster
 the honourable father to my foe
 once did i lay an ambush for your life
 a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
 but ere i last received the sacrament
 i did confess it and exactly begg'd
 your grace's pardon and i hope i had it
 this is my fault as for the rest appeall'd
 it issues from the rancour of a villain
 a recreant and most degenerate traitor
 which in myself i boldly will defend
 and interchangeably hurl down my gage
 upon this overweening traitor's foot
 to prove myself a loyal gentleman
 even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom
 in haste whereof most heartily i pray
 your highness to assign our trial day
king richard ii wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me
 let's purge this choler without letting blood
 this we prescribe though no physician
 deep malice makes too deep incision
 forget forgive conclude and be agreed
 our doctors say this is no month to bleed
 good uncle let this end where it begun
 we'll calm the duke of norfolk you your son
john of gaunt to be a makepeace shall become my age
 throw down my son the duke of norfolk's gage
king richard ii and norfolk throw down his
john of gaunt when harry when
 obedience bids i should not bid again
king richard ii norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot
thomas mowbray myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot
 my life thou shalt command but not my shame
 the one my duty owes but my fair name
 despite of death that lives upon my grave
 to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have
 i am disgraced impeach'd and baffled here
 pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear
 the which no balm can cure but his heartblood
 which breathed this poison
king richard ii rage must be withstood
 give me his gage lions make leopards tame
thomas mowbray yea but not change his spots take but my shame
 and i resign my gage my dear dear lord
 the purest treasure mortal times afford
 is spotless reputation that away
 men are but gilded loam or painted clay
 a jewel in a tentimesbarr'dup chest
 is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
 mine honour is my life both grow in one
 take honour from me and my life is done
 then dear my liege mine honour let me try
 in that i live and for that will i die
king richard ii cousin throw up your gage do you begin
henry bolingbroke o god defend my soul from such deep sin
 shall i seem crestfall'n in my father's sight
 or with pale beggarfear impeach my height
 before this outdared dastard ere my tongue
 shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
 or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
 the slavish motive of recanting fear
 and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
 where shame doth harbour even in mowbray's face

scene ii the duke of lancaster's palace
 enter john of gaunt with duchess
john of gaunt alas the part i had in woodstock's blood
 doth more solicit me than your exclaims
 to stir against the butchers of his life
 but since correction lieth in those hands
 which made the fault that we cannot correct
 put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
 who when they see the hours ripe on earth
 will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads
duchess finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
 hath love in thy old blood no living fire
 edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one
 were as seven vials of his sacred blood
 or seven fair branches springing from one root
 some of those seven are dried by nature's course
 some of those branches by the destinies cut
 but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester
 one vial full of edward's sacred blood
 one flourishing branch of his most royal root
 is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt
 is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded
 by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe
 ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
 that metal that selfmould that fashion'd thee
 made him a man and though thou livest and breathest
 yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent
 in some large measure to thy father's death
 in that thou seest thy wretched brother die
 who was the model of thy father's life
 call it not patience gaunt it is despair
 in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd
 thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
 teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
 that which in mean men we intitle patience
 is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
 what shall i say to safeguard thine own life
 the best way is to venge my gloucester's death
john of gaunt god's is the quarrel for god's substitute
 his deputy anointed in his sight
 hath caused his death the which if wrongfully
 let heaven revenge for i may never lift
 an angry arm against his minister
duchess where then alas may i complain myself
john of gaunt to god the widow's champion and defence
duchess why then i will farewell old gaunt
 thou goest to coventry there to behold
 our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight
 o sit my husband's wrongs on hereford's spear
 that it may enter butcher mowbray's breast
 or if misfortune miss the first career
 be mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom
 they may break his foaming courser's back
 and throw the rider headlong in the lists
 a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford
 farewell old gaunt thy sometimes brother's wife
 with her companion grief must end her life
john of gaunt sister farewell i must to coventry
 as much good stay with thee as go with me
duchess yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls
 not with the empty hollowness but weight
 i take my leave before i have begun
 for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
 commend me to thy brother edmund york
 lo this is allnay yet depart not so
 though this be all do not so quickly go
 i shall remember more bid himah what
 with all good speed at plashy visit me
 alack and what shall good old york there see
 but empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls
 unpeopled offices untrodden stones
 and what hear there for welcome but my groans
 therefore commend me let him not come there
 to seek out sorrow that dwells every where
 desolate desolate will i hence and die
 the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye

 farewell my blood which if today thou shed
 lament we may but not revenge thee dead
henry bolingbroke o let no noble eye profane a tear
 for me if i be gored with mowbray's spear
 as confident as is the falcon's flight
 against a bird do i with mowbray fight

 whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
 doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
 to reach at victory above my head
 add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
 and with thy blessings steel my lance's point
 that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat
 and furbish new the name of john a gaunt

 to god his sovereign and to him disloyal
 courageously and with a free desire
 attending but the signal to begin
lord marshal sound trumpets and set forward combatants
 a charge sounded
 stay the king hath thrown his warder down
king richard ii let them lay by their helmets and their spears
 and both return back to their chairs again
 withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound
 while we return these dukes what we decree
 a long flourish
 draw near
 and list what with our council we have done
 for that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
 with that dear blood which it hath fostered
 and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
 of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours sword
 and for we think the eaglewinged pride
 of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts
 with rivalhating envy set on you
 to wake our peace which in our country's cradle
 draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
 which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums
 with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray
 and grating shock of wrathful iron arms
 might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
 and make us wade even in our kindred's blood
 therefore we banish you our territories
 you cousin hereford upon pain of life
 till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
 shall not regreet our fair dominions
 but tread the stranger paths of banishment
henry bolingbroke your will be done this must my comfort be
 sun that warms you here shall shine on me
 and those his golden beams to you here lent
 shall point on me and gild my banishment
king richard ii norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
 which i with some unwillingness pronounce
 the sly slow hours shall not determinate
 the dateless limit of thy dear exile
 the hopeless word of never to return'
 breathe i against thee upon pain of life
thomas mowbray a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
 and all unlook'd for from your highness mouth
 a dearer merit not so deep a maim
 as to be cast forth in the common air
 have i deserved at your highness hands
 the language i have learn'd these forty years
 my native english now i must forego
 and now my tongue's use is to me no more
 than an unstringed viol or a harp
 or like a cunning instrument cased up
 or being open put into his hands
 that knows no touch to tune the harmony
 within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue
 doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips
 and dull unfeeling barren ignorance
 is made my gaoler to attend on me
 i am too old to fawn upon a nurse
 too far in years to be a pupil now
 what is thy sentence then but speechless death
 which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
king richard ii it boots thee not to be compassionate
 after our sentence plaining comes too late
thomas mowbray then thus i turn me from my country's light
 to dwell in solemn shades of endless night
king richard ii return again and take an oath with thee
 lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands
 swear by the duty that you owe to god
 our part therein we banish with yourselves
 to keep the oath that we administer
 you never shall so help you truth and god
 embrace each other's love in banishment
 nor never look upon each other's face
 nor never write regreet nor reconcile
 this louring tempest of your homebred hate
 nor never by advised purpose meet
 to plot contrive or complot any ill
 gainst us our state our subjects or our land
henry bolingbroke i swear
thomas mowbray and i to keep all this
henry bolingbroke norfolk so far as to mine enemy
 by this time had the king permitted us
 one of our souls had wander'd in the air
 banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
 as now our flesh is banish'd from this land
 confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
 since thou hast far to go bear not along
 the clogging burthen of a guilty soul
thomas mowbray no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor
 my name be blotted from the book of life
 and i from heaven banish'd as from hence
 but what thou art god thou and i do know
 and all too soon i fear the king shall rue
 farewell my liege now no way can i stray
 save back to england all the world's my way
 exit
king richard ii uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
 i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect
 hath from the number of his banish'd years
 pluck'd four away
 to henry bolingbroke
 six frozen winter spent
 return with welcome home from banishment
henry bolingbroke how long a time lies in one little word
 four lagging winters and four wanton springs
 end in a word such is the breath of kings
john of gaunt i thank my liege that in regard of me
 he shortens four years of my son's exile
 but little vantage shall i reap thereby
 for ere the six years that he hath to spend
 can change their moons and bring their times about
 my oildried lamp and timebewasted light
 shall be extinct with age and endless night
 my inch of taper will be burnt and done
 and blindfold death not let me see my son
king richard ii why uncle thou hast many years to live
john of gaunt but not a minute king that thou canst give
 shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
 and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
 thou canst help time to furrow me with age
 but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
 thy word is current with him for my death
 but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
king richard ii thy son is banish'd upon good advice
 whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave
 why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour
john of gaunt things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
 you urged me as a judge but i had rather
 you would have bid me argue like a father
 o had it been a stranger not my child
 to smooth his fault i should have been more mild
 a partial slander sought i to avoid
 and in the sentence my own life destroy'd
 alas i look'd when some of you should say
 i was too strict to make mine own away
 but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
 against my will to do myself this wrong
king richard ii cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
 six years we banish him and he shall go
 flourish exeunt king richard ii and train
duke of aumerle cousin farewell what presence must not know
 from where you do remain let paper show
lord marshal my lord no leave take i for i will ride
 as far as land will let me by your side
john of gaunt o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
 that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends
henry bolingbroke i have too few to take my leave of you
 when the tongue's office should be prodigal
 to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart
john of gaunt thy grief is but thy absence for a time
henry bolingbroke joy absent grief is present for that time
john of gaunt what is six winters they are quickly gone
henry bolingbroke to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten
john of gaunt call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure
henry bolingbroke my heart will sigh when i miscall it so
 which finds it an inforced pilgrimage
john of gaunt the sullen passage of thy weary steps
 esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
 the precious jewel of thy home return
henry bolingbroke nay rather every tedious stride i make
 will but remember me what a deal of world
 i wander from the jewels that i love
 must i not serve a long apprenticehood
 to foreign passages and in the end
 having my freedom boast of nothing else
 but that i was a journeyman to grief
john of gaunt all places that the eye of heaven visits
 are to a wise man ports and happy havens
 teach thy necessity to reason thus
 there is no virtue like necessity
 think not the king did banish thee
 but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit
 where it perceives it is but faintly borne
 go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour
 and not the king exiled thee or suppose
 devouring pestilence hangs in our air
 and thou art flying to a fresher clime
 look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
 to lie that way thou go'st not whence thou comest
 suppose the singing birds musicians
 the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd
 the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
 than a delightful measure or a dance
 for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
 the man that mocks at it and sets it light
henry bolingbroke o who can hold a fire in his hand
 by thinking on the frosty caucasus
 or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
 by bare imagination of a feast
 or wallow naked in december snow
 by thinking on fantastic summer's heat
 o no the apprehension of the good
 gives but the greater feeling to the worse
 fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
 than when he bites but lanceth not the sore
john of gaunt come come my son i'll bring thee on thy way
 had i thy youth and cause i would not stay
henry bolingbroke then england's ground farewell sweet soil adieu
 my mother and my nurse that bears me yet
 where'er i wander boast of this i can
 though banish'd yet a trueborn englishman

scene iv the court
 enter king richard ii with bagot and green at one
 door and the duke of aumerle at another
king richard ii we did observe cousin aumerle
 how far brought you high hereford on his way
duke of aumerle i brought high hereford if you call him so
 but to the next highway and there i left him
king richard ii and say what store of parting tears were shed
duke of aumerle faith none for me except the northeast wind
 which then blew bitterly against our faces
 awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance
 did grace our hollow parting with a tear
king richard ii what said our cousin when you parted with him
duke of aumerle farewell'
 and for my heart disdained that my tongue
 should so profane the word that taught me craft
 to counterfeit oppression of such grief
 that words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave
 marry would the word farewell have lengthen'd hours
 and added years to his short banishment
 he should have had a volume of farewells
 but since it would not he had none of me
king richard ii he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt
 when time shall call him home from banishment
 whether our kinsman come to see his friends
 ourself and bushy bagot here and green
 observed his courtship to the common people
 how he did seem to dive into their hearts
 with humble and familiar courtesy
 what reverence he did throw away on slaves
 wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
 and patient underbearing of his fortune
 as twere to banish their affects with him
 off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench
 a brace of draymen bid god speed him well
 and had the tribute of his supple knee
 with thanks my countrymen my loving friends'
 as were our england in reversion his
 and he our subjects next degree in hope
green well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
 now for the rebels which stand out in ireland
 expedient manage must be made my liege
 ere further leisure yield them further means
 for their advantage and your highness loss
king richard ii we will ourself in person to this war
 and for our coffers with too great a court
 and liberal largess are grown somewhat light
 we are inforced to farm our royal realm
 the revenue whereof shall furnish us
 for our affairs in hand if that come short
 our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
 whereto when they shall know what men are rich
 they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
 and send them after to supply our wants
 for we will make for ireland presently
 enter bushy
 bushy what news
bushy old john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord
 suddenly taken and hath sent post haste
 to entreat your majesty to visit him
king richard ii where lies he
bushy at ely house
king richard ii now put it god in the physician's mind
 to help him to his grave immediately
 the lining of his coffers shall make coats
 to deck our soldiers for these irish wars
 come gentlemen let's all go visit him
 pray god we may make haste and come too late
all amen
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act ii
scene i ely house
 enter john of gaunt sick with the duke of york
 &c
john of gaunt will the king come that i may breathe my last
 in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
duke of york vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
 for all in vain comes counsel to his ear
john of gaunt o but they say the tongues of dying men
 enforce attention like deep harmony
 where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
 for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
 he that no more must say is listen'd more
 than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
 more are men's ends mark'd than their lives before
 the setting sun and music at the close
 as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
 writ in remembrance more than things long past
 though richard my life's counsel would not hear
 my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear
duke of york no it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds
 as praises of whose taste the wise are fond
 lascivious metres to whose venom sound
 the open ear of youth doth always listen
 report of fashions in proud italy
 whose manners still our tardy apish nation
 limps after in base imitation
 where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
 so it be new there's no respect how vile
 that is not quickly buzzed into his ears
 then all too late comes counsel to be heard
 where will doth mutiny with wit's regard
 direct not him whose way himself will choose
 tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose
john of gaunt methinks i am a prophet new inspired
 and thus expiring do foretell of him
 his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
 for violent fires soon burn out themselves
 small showers last long but sudden storms are short
 he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
 with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
 light vanity insatiate cormorant
 consuming means soon preys upon itself
 this royal throne of kings this scepter'd isle
 this earth of majesty this seat of mars
 this other eden demiparadise
 this fortress built by nature for herself
 against infection and the hand of war
 this happy breed of men this little world
 this precious stone set in the silver sea
 which serves it in the office of a wall
 or as a moat defensive to a house
 against the envy of less happier lands
 this blessed plot this earth this realm this england
 this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
 fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth
 renowned for their deeds as far from home
 for christian service and true chivalry
 as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry
 of the world's ransom blessed mary's son
 this land of such dear souls this dear dear land
 dear for her reputation through the world
 is now leased out i die pronouncing it
 like to a tenement or pelting farm
 england bound in with the triumphant sea
 whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
 of watery neptune is now bound in with shame
 with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
 that england that was wont to conquer others
 hath made a shameful conquest of itself
 ah would the scandal vanish with my life
 how happy then were my ensuing death
 enter king richard ii and queen duke of aumerle
 bushy green bagot lord ross and lord
 willoughby
duke of york the king is come deal mildly with his youth
 for young hot colts being raged do rage the more
queen how fares our noble uncle lancaster
king richard ii what comfort man how is't with aged gaunt
john of gaunt o how that name befits my composition
 old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
 within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
 and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
 for sleeping england long time have i watch'd
 watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt
 the pleasure that some fathers feed upon
 is my strict fast i mean my children's looks
 and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
 gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave
 whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones
king richard ii can sick men play so nicely with their names
john of gaunt no misery makes sport to mock itself
 since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
 i mock my name great king to flatter thee
king richard ii should dying men flatter with those that live
john of gaunt no no men living flatter those that die
king richard ii thou now adying say'st thou flatterest me
john of gaunt o no thou diest though i the sicker be
king richard ii i am in health i breathe and see thee ill
john of gaunt now he that made me knows i see thee ill
 ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
 thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land
 wherein thou liest in reputation sick
 and thou too careless patient as thou art
 commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
 of those physicians that first wounded thee
 a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
 whose compass is no bigger than thy head
 and yet incaged in so small a verge
 the waste is no whit lesser than thy land
 o had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
 seen how his son's son should destroy his sons
 from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
 deposing thee before thou wert possess'd
 which art possess'd now to depose thyself
 why cousin wert thou regent of the world
 it were a shame to let this land by lease
 but for thy world enjoying but this land
 is it not more than shame to shame it so
 landlord of england art thou now not king
 thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou
king richard ii a lunatic leanwitted fool
 presuming on an ague's privilege
 darest with thy frozen admonition
 make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
 with fury from his native residence
 now by my seat's right royal majesty
 wert thou not brother to great edward's son
 this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
 should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders
john of gaunt o spare me not my brother edward's son
 for that i was his father edward's son
 that blood already like the pelican
 hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused
 my brother gloucester plain wellmeaning soul
 whom fair befal in heaven mongst happy souls
 may be a precedent and witness good
 that thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood
 join with the present sickness that i have
 and thy unkindness be like crooked age
 to crop at once a too long wither'd flower
 live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
 these words hereafter thy tormentors be
 convey me to my bed then to my grave
 love they to live that love and honour have
 exit borne off by his attendants
king richard ii and let them die that age and sullens have
 for both hast thou and both become the grave
duke of york i do beseech your majesty impute his words
 to wayward sickliness and age in him
 he loves you on my life and holds you dear
 as harry duke of hereford were he here
king richard ii right you say true as hereford's love so his
 as theirs so mine and all be as it is
 enter northumberland
northumberland my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty
king richard ii what says he
northumberland nay nothing all is said
 his tongue is now a stringless instrument
 words life and all old lancaster hath spent
duke of york be york the next that must be bankrupt so
 though death be poor it ends a mortal woe
king richard ii the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
 his time is spent our pilgrimage must be
 so much for that now for our irish wars
 we must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns
 which live like venom where no venom else
 but only they have privilege to live
 and for these great affairs do ask some charge
 towards our assistance we do seize to us
 the plate corn revenues and moveables
 whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd
duke of york how long shall i be patient ah how long
 shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
 not gloucester's death nor hereford's banishment
 not gaunt's rebukes nor england's private wrongs
 nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke
 about his marriage nor my own disgrace
 have ever made me sour my patient cheek
 or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face
 i am the last of noble edward's sons
 of whom thy father prince of wales was first
 in war was never lion raged more fierce
 in peace was never gentle lamb more mild
 than was that young and princely gentleman
 his face thou hast for even so look'd he
 accomplish'd with the number of thy hours
 but when he frown'd it was against the french
 and not against his friends his noble hand
 did will what he did spend and spent not that
 which his triumphant father's hand had won
 his hands were guilty of no kindred blood
 but bloody with the enemies of his kin
 o richard york is too far gone with grief
 or else he never would compare between
king richard ii why uncle what's the matter
duke of york o my liege
 pardon me if you please if not i pleased
 not to be pardon'd am content withal
 seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
 the royalties and rights of banish'd hereford
 is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live
 was not gaunt just and is not harry true
 did not the one deserve to have an heir
 is not his heir a welldeserving son
 take hereford's rights away and take from time
 his charters and his customary rights
 let not tomorrow then ensue today
 be not thyself for how art thou a king
 but by fair sequence and succession
 now afore godgod forbid i say true
 if you do wrongfully seize hereford's rights
 call in the letters patent that he hath
 by his attorneysgeneral to sue
 his livery and deny his offer'd homage
 you pluck a thousand dangers on your head
 you lose a thousand welldisposed hearts
 and prick my tender patience to those thoughts
 which honour and allegiance cannot think
king richard ii think what you will we seize into our hands
 his plate his goods his money and his lands
duke of york i'll not be by the while my liege farewell
 what will ensue hereof there's none can tell
 but by bad courses may be understood
 that their events can never fall out good
 exit
king richard ii go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight
 bid him repair to us to ely house
 to see this business tomorrow next
 we will for ireland and tis time i trow
 and we create in absence of ourself
 our uncle york lord governor of england
 for he is just and always loved us well
 come on our queen tomorrow must we part
 be merry for our time of stay is short
 flourish exeunt king richard ii queen duke of
 aumerle bushy green and bagot
northumberland well lords the duke of lancaster is dead
lord ross and living too for now his son is duke
lord willoughby barely in title not in revenue
northumberland richly in both if justice had her right
lord ross my heart is great but it must break with silence
 ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue
northumberland nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more
 that speaks thy words again to do thee harm
lord willoughby tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford
 if it be so out with it boldly man
 quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him
lord ross no good at all that i can do for him
 unless you call it good to pity him
 bereft and gelded of his patrimony
northumberland now afore god tis shame such wrongs are borne
 in him a royal prince and many moe
 of noble blood in this declining land
 the king is not himself but basely led
 by flatterers and what they will inform
 merely in hate gainst any of us all
 that will the king severely prosecute
 gainst us our lives our children and our heirs
lord ross the commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes
 and quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fined
 for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts
lord willoughby and daily new exactions are devised
 as blanks benevolences and i wot not what
 but what o god's name doth become of this
northumberland wars have not wasted it for warr'd he hath not
 but basely yielded upon compromise
 that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows
 more hath he spent in peace than they in wars
lord ross the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm
lord willoughby the king's grown bankrupt like a broken man
northumberland reproach and dissolution hangeth over him
lord ross he hath not money for these irish wars
 his burthenous taxations notwithstanding
 but by the robbing of the banish'd duke
northumberland his noble kinsman most degenerate king
 but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
 yet see no shelter to avoid the storm
 we see the wind sit sore upon our sails
 and yet we strike not but securely perish
lord ross we see the very wreck that we must suffer
 and unavoided is the danger now
 for suffering so the causes of our wreck
northumberland not so even through the hollow eyes of death
 i spy life peering but i dare not say
 how near the tidings of our comfort is
lord willoughby nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours
lord ross be confident to speak northumberland
 we three are but thyself and speaking so
 thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold
northumberland then thus i have from port le blanc a bay
 in brittany received intelligence
 that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham
 
 that late broke from the duke of exeter
 his brother archbishop late of canterbury
 sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston
 sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint
 all these well furnish'd by the duke of bretagne
 with eight tall ships three thousand men of war
 are making hither with all due expedience
 and shortly mean to touch our northern shore
 perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
 the first departing of the king for ireland
 if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
 imp out our drooping country's broken wing
 redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown
 wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
 and make high majesty look like itself
 away with me in post to ravenspurgh
 but if you faint as fearing to do so
 stay and be secret and myself will go
lord ross to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear
lord willoughby hold out my horse and i will first be there

bushy madam your majesty is too much sad
 you promised when you parted with the king
 to lay aside lifeharming heaviness
 and entertain a cheerful disposition
queen to please the king i did to please myself
 i cannot do it yet i know no cause
 why i should welcome such a guest as grief
 save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
 as my sweet richard yet again methinks
 some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb
 is coming towards me and my inward soul
 with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves
 more than with parting from my lord the king
bushy each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
 which shows like grief itself but is not so
 for sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears
 divides one thing entire to many objects
 like perspectives which rightly gazed upon
 show nothing but confusion eyed awry
 distinguish form so your sweet majesty
 looking awry upon your lord's departure
 find shapes of grief more than himself to wail
 which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows
 of what it is not then thricegracious queen
 more than your lord's departure weep not more's not seen
 or if it be tis with false sorrow's eye
 which for things true weeps things imaginary
queen it may be so but yet my inward soul
 persuades me it is otherwise howe'er it be
 i cannot but be sad so heavy sad
 as though on thinking on no thought i think
 makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
bushy tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady
queen tis nothing less conceit is still derived
 from some forefather grief mine is not so
 for nothing had begot my something grief
 or something hath the nothing that i grieve
 tis in reversion that i do possess
 but what it is that is not yet known what
 i cannot name tis nameless woe i wot

green god save your majesty and well met gentlemen
 i hope the king is not yet shipp'd for ireland
queen why hopest thou so tis better hope he is
 for his designs crave haste his haste good hope
 then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd
green that he our hope might have retired his power
 and driven into despair an enemy's hope
 who strongly hath set footing in this land
 the banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself
 and with uplifted arms is safe arrived
 at ravenspurgh
queen now god in heaven forbid
green ah madam tis too true and that is worse
 the lord northumberland his son young henry percy
 the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby
 with all their powerful friends are fled to him
bushy why have you not proclaim'd northumberland
 and all the rest revolted faction traitors
green we have whereupon the earl of worcester
 hath broke his staff resign'd his stewardship
 and all the household servants fled with him
 to bolingbroke
queen so green thou art the midwife to my woe
 and bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir
 now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
 and i a gasping newdeliver'd mother
 have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'd
bushy despair not madam
queen who shall hinder me
 i will despair and be at enmity
 with cozening hope he is a flatterer
 a parasite a keeper back of death
 who gently would dissolve the bands of life
 which false hope lingers in extremity
 enter duke of york

queen with signs of war about his aged neck
 o full of careful business are his looks
 uncle for god's sake speak comfortable words
duke of york should i do so i should belie my thoughts
 comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth
 where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
 your husband he is gone to save far off
 whilst others come to make him lose at home
 here am i left to underprop his land

 now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him

 bid her send me presently a thousand pound
 hold take my ring
servant my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship
 today as i came by i called there
 but i shall grieve you to report the rest
duke of york what is't knave
servant an hour before i came the duchess died
duke of york god for his mercy what a tide of woes
 comes rushing on this woeful land at once
 i know not what to do i would to god
 so my untruth had not provoked him to it
 the king had cut off my head with my brother's
 what are there no posts dispatch'd for ireland
 how shall we do for money for these wars
 come sistercousin i would saypray pardon me
 go fellow get thee home provide some carts
 and bring away the armour that is there

 if i know how or which way to order these affairs
 thus thrust disorderly into my hands

 whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
 well somewhat we must do come cousin i'll
 dispose of you
 gentlemen go muster up your men
 and meet me presently at berkeley
 i should to plashy too
 but time will not permit all is uneven
 and every thing is left at six and seven
 exeunt duke of york and queen
bushy the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland
 but none returns for us to levy power
 proportionable to the enemy
 is all unpossible
green besides our nearness to the king in love
 is near the hate of those love not the king
bagot and that's the wavering commons for their love
 lies in their purses and whoso empties them
 by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
bushy wherein the king stands generally condemn'd
bagot if judgement lie in them then so do we
 because we ever have been near the king
green well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle
 the earl of wiltshire is already there
bushy thither will i with you for little office
 the hateful commons will perform for us
 except like curs to tear us all to pieces
 will you go along with us
bagot no i will to ireland to his majesty
 farewell if heart's presages be not vain
 we three here art that ne'er shall meet again
bushy that's as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke
green alas poor duke the task he undertakes
 is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry
 where one on his side fights thousands will fly
 farewell at once for once for all and ever
bushy well we may meet again

 enter henry bolingbroke and northumberland with forces
henry bolingbroke how far is it my lord to berkeley now
northumberland believe me noble lord
 i am a stranger here in gloucestershire
 these high wild hills and rough uneven ways
 draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
 and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
 making the hard way sweet and delectable
 but i bethink me what a weary way
 from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found
 in ross and willoughby wanting your company
 which i protest hath very much beguiled
 the tediousness and process of my travel
 but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
 the present benefit which i possess
 and hope to joy is little less in joy
 than hope enjoy'd by this the weary lords
 shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
 by sight of what i have your noble company
henry bolingbroke of much less value is my company
 than your good words but who comes here
 enter henry percy
northumberland it is my son young harry percy
 sent from my brother worcester whencesoever
 harry how fares your uncle
henry percy i had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you
northumberland why is he not with the queen
henry percy no my good lord he hath forsook the court
 broken his staff of office and dispersed
 the household of the king
northumberland what was his reason
 he was not so resolved when last we spake together
henry percy because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
 but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh
 to offer service to the duke of hereford
 and sent me over by berkeley to discover
 what power the duke of york had levied there
 then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh
northumberland have you forgot the duke of hereford boy
henry percy no my good lord for that is not forgot
 which ne'er i did remember to my knowledge
 i never in my life did look on him
northumberland then learn to know him now this is the duke
henry percy my gracious lord i tender you my service
 such as it is being tender raw and young
 which elder days shall ripen and confirm
 to more approved service and desert
henry bolingbroke i thank thee gentle percy and be sure
 i count myself in nothing else so happy
 as in a soul remembering my good friends
 and as my fortune ripens with thy love
 it shall be still thy true love's recompense
 my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
northumberland how far is it to berkeley and what stir
 keeps good old york there with his men of war
henry percy there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
 mann'd with three hundred men as i have heard
 and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour
 none else of name and noble estimate
 enter lord ross and lord willoughby
northumberland here come the lords of ross and willoughby
 bloody with spurring fieryred with haste
henry bolingbroke welcome my lords i wot your love pursues
 a banish'd traitor all my treasury
 is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd
 shall be your love and labour's recompense
lord ross your presence makes us rich most noble lord
lord willoughby and far surmounts our labour to attain it
henry bolingbroke evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
 which till my infant fortune comes to years
 stands for my bounty but who comes here
 enter lord berkeley
northumberland it is my lord of berkeley as i guess
lord berkeley my lord of hereford my message is to you
henry bolingbroke my lord my answer isto lancaster
 and i am come to seek that name in england
 and i must find that title in your tongue
 before i make reply to aught you say
lord berkeley mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
 to raze one title of your honour out
 to you my lord i come what lord you will
 from the most gracious regent of this land
 the duke of york to know what pricks you on
 to take advantage of the absent time
 and fright our native peace with selfborn arms
 enter duke of york attended
henry bolingbroke i shall not need transport my words by you
 here comes his grace in person my noble uncle
 kneels
duke of york show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
 whose duty is deceiveable and false
henry bolingbroke my gracious uncle
duke of york tut tut
 grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
 i am no traitor's uncle and that word grace'
 in an ungracious mouth is but profane
 why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
 dared once to touch a dust of england's ground
 but then more why why have they dared to march
 so many miles upon her peaceful bosom
 frighting her palefaced villages with war
 and ostentation of despised arms
 comest thou because the anointed king is hence
 why foolish boy the king is left behind
 and in my loyal bosom lies his power
 were i but now the lord of such hot youth
 as when brave gaunt thy father and myself
 rescued the black prince that young mars of men
 from forth the ranks of many thousand french
 o then how quickly should this arm of mine
 now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee
 and minister correction to thy fault
henry bolingbroke my gracious uncle let me know my fault
 on what condition stands it and wherein
duke of york even in condition of the worst degree
 in gross rebellion and detested treason
 thou art a banish'd man and here art come
 before the expiration of thy time
 in braving arms against thy sovereign
henry bolingbroke as i was banish'd i was banish'd hereford
 but as i come i come for lancaster
 and noble uncle i beseech your grace
 look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
 you are my father for methinks in you
 i see old gaunt alive o then my father
 will you permit that i shall stand condemn'd
 a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
 pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
 to upstart unthrifts wherefore was i born
 if that my cousin king be king of england
 it must be granted i am duke of lancaster
 you have a son aumerle my noble cousin
 had you first died and he been thus trod down
 he should have found his uncle gaunt a father
 to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
 i am denied to sue my livery here
 and yet my letterspatents give me leave
 my father's goods are all distrain'd and sold
 and these and all are all amiss employ'd
 what would you have me do i am a subject
 and i challenge law attorneys are denied me
 and therefore personally i lay my claim
 to my inheritance of free descent
northumberland the noble duke hath been too much abused
lord ross it stands your grace upon to do him right
lord willoughby base men by his endowments are made great
duke of york my lords of england let me tell you this
 i have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
 and laboured all i could to do him right
 but in this kind to come in braving arms
 be his own carver and cut out his way
 to find out right with wrong it may not be
 and you that do abet him in this kind
 cherish rebellion and are rebels all
northumberland the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
 but for his own and for the right of that
 we all have strongly sworn to give him aid
 and let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath
duke of york well well i see the issue of these arms
 i cannot mend it i must needs confess
 because my power is weak and all ill left
 but if i could by him that gave me life
 i would attach you all and make you stoop
 unto the sovereign mercy of the king
 but since i cannot be it known to you
 i do remain as neuter so fare you well
 unless you please to enter in the castle
 and there repose you for this night
henry bolingbroke an offer uncle that we will accept
 but we must win your grace to go with us
 to bristol castle which they say is held
 by bushy bagot and their complices
 the caterpillars of the commonwealth
 which i have sworn to weed and pluck away
duke of york it may be i will go with you but yet i'll pause
 for i am loath to break our country's laws
 nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
 things past redress are now with me past care

scene iv a camp in wales
 enter earl of salisbury and a welsh captain
captain my lord of salisbury we have stay'd ten days
 and hardly kept our countrymen together
 and yet we hear no tidings from the king
 therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell
earl of salisbury stay yet another day thou trusty welshman
 the king reposeth all his confidence in thee
captain tis thought the king is dead we will not stay
 the baytrees in our country are all wither'd
 and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
 the palefaced moon looks bloody on the earth
 and leanlook'd prophets whisper fearful change
 rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
 the one in fear to lose what they enjoy
 the other to enjoy by rage and war
 these signs forerun the death or fall of kings
 farewell our countrymen are gone and fled
 as well assured richard their king is dead
 exit
earl of salisbury ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind
 i see thy glory like a shooting star
 fall to the base earth from the firmament
 thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west
 witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
 thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
 and crossly to thy good all fortune goes
 exit

act iii
scene i bristol before the castle
 enter henry bolingbroke duke of york
 northumberland lord ross henry percy lord
 willoughby with bushy and green prisoners
henry bolingbroke bring forth these men
 bushy and green i will not vex your souls
 since presently your souls must part your bodies
 with too much urging your pernicious lives
 for twere no charity yet to wash your blood
 from off my hands here in the view of men
 i will unfold some causes of your deaths
 you have misled a prince a royal king
 a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
 by you unhappied and disfigured clean
 you have in manner with your sinful hours
 made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
 broke the possession of a royal bed
 and stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
 with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
 myself a prince by fortune of my birth
 near to the king in blood and near in love
 till you did make him misinterpret me
 have stoop'd my neck under your injuries
 and sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds
 eating the bitter bread of banishment
 whilst you have fed upon my signories
 dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods
 from my own windows torn my household coat
 razed out my imprese leaving me no sign
 save men's opinions and my living blood
 to show the world i am a gentleman
 this and much more much more than twice all this
 condemns you to the death see them deliver'd over
 to execution and the hand of death
bushy more welcome is the stroke of death to me
 than bolingbroke to england lords farewell
green my comfort is that heaven will take our souls
 and plague injustice with the pains of hell
henry bolingbroke my lord northumberland see them dispatch'd
 exeunt northumberland and others with the
 prisoners
 uncle you say the queen is at your house
 for god's sake fairly let her be entreated
 tell her i send to her my kind commends
 take special care my greetings be deliver'd
duke of york a gentleman of mine i have dispatch'd
 with letters of your love to her at large
henry bolingbroke thank gentle uncle come lords away
 to fight with glendower and his complices
 awhile to work and after holiday

act iii
scene ii the coast of wales a castle in view
 drums flourish and colours enter king richard
 ii the bishop of carlisle duke of aumerle and soldiers
king richard ii barkloughly castle call they this at hand
duke of aumerle yea my lord how brooks your grace the air
 after your late tossing on the breaking seas
king richard ii needs must i like it well i weep for joy
 to stand upon my kingdom once again
 dear earth i do salute thee with my hand
 though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs
 as a longparted mother with her child
 plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
 so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth
 and do thee favours with my royal hands
 feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth
 nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
 but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
 and heavygaited toads lie in their way
 doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
 which with usurping steps do trample thee
 yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
 and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
 guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder
 whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
 throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies
 mock not my senseless conjuration lords
 this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
 prove armed soldiers ere her native king
 shall falter under foul rebellion's arms
bishop of carlisle fear not my lord that power that made you king
 hath power to keep you king in spite of all
 the means that heaven yields must be embraced
 and not neglected else if heaven would
 and we will not heaven's offer we refuse
 the proffer'd means of succor and redress
duke of aumerle he means my lord that we are too remiss
 whilst bolingbroke through our security
 grows strong and great in substance and in power
king richard ii discomfortable cousin know'st thou not
 that when the searching eye of heaven is hid
 behind the globe that lights the lower world
 then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
 in murders and in outrage boldly here
 but when from under this terrestrial ball
 he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
 and darts his light through every guilty hole
 then murders treasons and detested sins
 the cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs
 stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
 so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke
 who all this while hath revell'd in the night
 whilst we were wandering with the antipodes
 shall see us rising in our throne the east
 his treasons will sit blushing in his face
 not able to endure the sight of day
 but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin
 not all the water in the rough rude sea
 can wash the balm off from an anointed king
 the breath of worldly men cannot depose
 the deputy elected by the lord
 for every man that bolingbroke hath press'd
 to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
 god for his richard hath in heavenly pay
 a glorious angel then if angels fight
 weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right
 enter earl of salisbury
 welcome my lord how far off lies your power
earl of salisbury nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
 than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue
 and bids me speak of nothing but despair
 one day too late i fear me noble lord
 hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
 o call back yesterday bid time return
 and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
 today today unhappy day too late
 o'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state
 for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead
 are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled
duke of aumerle comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale
king richard ii but now the blood of twenty thousand men
 did triumph in my face and they are fled
 and till so much blood thither come again
 have i not reason to look pale and dead
 all souls that will be safe fly from my side
 for time hath set a blot upon my pride
duke of aumerle comfort my liege remember who you are
king richard ii i had forgot myself am i not king
 awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest
 is not the king's name twenty thousand names
 arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
 at thy great glory look not to the ground
 ye favourites of a king are we not high
 high be our thoughts i know my uncle york
 hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here
 enter sir stephen scroop
sir stephen scroop more health and happiness betide my liege
 than can my caretuned tongue deliver him
king richard ii mine ear is open and my heart prepared
 the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
 say is my kingdom lost why twas my care
 and what loss is it to be rid of care
 strives bolingbroke to be as great as we
 greater he shall not be if he serve god
 we'll serve him too and be his fellow so
 revolt our subjects that we cannot mend
 they break their faith to god as well as us
 cry woe destruction ruin and decay
 the worst is death and death will have his day
sir stephen scroop glad am i that your highness is so arm'd
 to bear the tidings of calamity
 like an unseasonable stormy day
 which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
 as if the world were all dissolved to tears
 so high above his limits swells the rage
 of bolingbroke covering your fearful land
 with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
 whitebeards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
 against thy majesty boys with women's voices
 strive to speak big and clap their female joints
 in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
 the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
 of doublefatal yew against thy state
 yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills
 against thy seat both young and old rebel
 and all goes worse than i have power to tell
king richard ii too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill
 where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot
 what is become of bushy where is green
 that they have let the dangerous enemy
 measure our confines with such peaceful steps
 if we prevail their heads shall pay for it
 i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke
sir stephen scroop peace have they made with him indeed my lord
king richard ii o villains vipers damn'd without redemption
 dogs easily won to fawn on any man
 snakes in my heartblood warm'd that sting my heart
 three judases each one thrice worse than judas
 would they make peace terrible hell make war
 upon their spotted souls for this offence
sir stephen scroop sweet love i see changing his property
 turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
 again uncurse their souls their peace is made
 with heads and not with hands those whom you curse
 have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
 and lie full low graved in the hollow ground
duke of aumerle is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead
sir stephen scroop ay all of them at bristol lost their heads
duke of aumerle where is the duke my father with his power
king richard ii no matter where of comfort no man speak
 let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
 make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
 write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
 let's choose executors and talk of wills
 and yet not so for what can we bequeath
 save our deposed bodies to the ground
 our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke's
 and nothing can we call our own but death
 and that small model of the barren earth
 which serves as paste and cover to our bones
 for god's sake let us sit upon the ground
 and tell sad stories of the death of kings
 how some have been deposed some slain in war
 some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed
 some poison'd by their wives some sleeping kill'd
 all murder'd for within the hollow crown
 that rounds the mortal temples of a king
 keeps death his court and there the antic sits
 scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
 allowing him a breath a little scene
 to monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks
 infusing him with self and vain conceit
 as if this flesh which walls about our life
 were brass impregnable and humour'd thus
 comes at the last and with a little pin
 bores through his castle wall and farewell king
 cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
 with solemn reverence throw away respect
 tradition form and ceremonious duty
 for you have but mistook me all this while
 i live with bread like you feel want
 taste grief need friends subjected thus
 how can you say to me i am a king
bishop of carlisle my lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes
 but presently prevent the ways to wail
 to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
 gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
 and so your follies fight against yourself
 fear and be slain no worse can come to fight
 and fight and die is death destroying death
 where fearing dying pays death servile breath
duke of aumerle my father hath a power inquire of him
 and learn to make a body of a limb
king richard ii thou chidest me well proud bolingbroke i come
 to change blows with thee for our day of doom
 this ague fit of fear is overblown
 an easy task it is to win our own
 say scroop where lies our uncle with his power
 speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
sir stephen scroop men judge by the complexion of the sky
 the state and inclination of the day
 so may you by my dull and heavy eye
 my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
 i play the torturer by small and small
 to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
 your uncle york is join'd with bolingbroke
 and all your northern castles yielded up
 and all your southern gentlemen in arms
 upon his party
king richard ii thou hast said enough
 beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
 to duke of aumerle
 of that sweet way i was in to despair
 what say you now what comfort have we now
 by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly
 that bids me be of comfort any more
 go to flint castle there i'll pine away
 a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey
 that power i have discharge and let them go
 to ear the land that hath some hope to grow
 for i have none let no man speak again
 to alter this for counsel is but vain
duke of aumerle my liege one word
king richard ii he does me double wrong
 that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
 discharge my followers let them hence away
 from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act iii
scene iii wales before flint castle
 enter with drum and colours henry bolingbroke
 duke of york northumberland attendants and forces
henry bolingbroke so that by this intelligence we learn
 the welshmen are dispersed and salisbury
 is gone to meet the king who lately landed
 with some few private friends upon this coast
northumberland the news is very fair and good my lord
 richard not far from hence hath hid his head
duke of york it would beseem the lord northumberland
 to say king richard alack the heavy day
 when such a sacred king should hide his head
northumberland your grace mistakes only to be brief
 left i his title out
duke of york the time hath been
 would you have been so brief with him he would
 have been so brief with you to shorten you
 for taking so the head your whole head's length
henry bolingbroke mistake not uncle further than you should
duke of york take not good cousin further than you should
 lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads
henry bolingbroke i know it uncle and oppose not myself
 against their will but who comes here
 enter henry percy
 welcome harry what will not this castle yield
henry percy the castle royally is mann'd my lord
 against thy entrance
henry bolingbroke royally
 why it contains no king
henry percy yes my good lord
 it doth contain a king king richard lies
 within the limits of yon lime and stone
 and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury
 sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman
 of holy reverence who i cannot learn
northumberland o belike it is the bishop of carlisle
henry bolingbroke noble lords
 go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
 through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
 into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver
 henry bolingbroke
 on both his knees doth kiss king richard's hand
 and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
 to his most royal person hither come
 even at his feet to lay my arms and power
 provided that my banishment repeal'd
 and lands restored again be freely granted
 if not i'll use the advantage of my power
 and lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
 rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd englishmen
 the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke
 it is such crimson tempest should bedrench
 the fresh green lap of fair king richard's land
 my stooping duty tenderly shall show
 go signify as much while here we march
 upon the grassy carpet of this plain
 let's march without the noise of threatening drum
 that from this castle's tatter'd battlements
 our fair appointments may be well perused
 methinks king richard and myself should meet
 with no less terror than the elements
 of fire and water when their thundering shock
 at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
 be he the fire i'll be the yielding water
 the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain
 my waters on the earth and not on him
 march on and mark king richard how he looks
 parle without and answer within then a flourish
 enter on the walls king richard ii the bishop of
 carlisle duke of aumerle sir stephen scroop and
 earl of salisbury
 see see king richard doth himself appear
 as doth the blushing discontented sun
 from out the fiery portal of the east
 when he perceives the envious clouds are bent
 to dim his glory and to stain the track
 of his bright passage to the occident
duke of york yet looks he like a king behold his eye
 as bright as is the eagle's lightens forth
 controlling majesty alack alack for woe
 that any harm should stain so fair a show
king richard ii we are amazed and thus long have we stood
 to watch the fearful bending of thy knee
 to northumberland
 because we thought ourself thy lawful king
 and if we be how dare thy joints forget
 to pay their awful duty to our presence
 if we be not show us the hand of god
 that hath dismissed us from our stewardship
 for well we know no hand of blood and bone
 can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
 unless he do profane steal or usurp
 and though you think that all as you have done
 have torn their souls by turning them from us
 and we are barren and bereft of friends
 yet know my master god omnipotent
 is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
 armies of pestilence and they shall strike
 your children yet unborn and unbegot
 that lift your vassal hands against my head
 and threat the glory of my precious crown
 tell bolingbrokefor yond methinks he stands
 that every stride he makes upon my land
 is dangerous treason he is come to open
 the purple testament of bleeding war
 but ere the crown he looks for live in peace
 ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons
 shall ill become the flower of england's face
 change the complexion of her maidpale peace
 to scarlet indignation and bedew
 her pastures grass with faithful english blood
northumberland the king of heaven forbid our lord the king
 should so with civil and uncivil arms
 be rush'd upon thy thrice noble cousin
 harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
 and by the honourable tomb he swears
 that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones
 and by the royalties of both your bloods
 currents that spring from one most gracious head
 and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt
 and by the worth and honour of himself
 comprising all that may be sworn or said
 his coming hither hath no further scope
 than for his lineal royalties and to beg
 enfranchisement immediate on his knees
 which on thy royal party granted once
 his glittering arms he will commend to rust
 his barbed steeds to stables and his heart
 to faithful service of your majesty
 this swears he as he is a prince is just
 and as i am a gentleman i credit him
king richard ii northumberland say thus the king returns
 his noble cousin is right welcome hither
 and all the number of his fair demands
 shall be accomplish'd without contradiction
 with all the gracious utterance thou hast
 speak to his gentle hearing kind commends
 we do debase ourselves cousin do we not
 to duke of aumerle
 to look so poorly and to speak so fair
 shall we call back northumberland and send
 defiance to the traitor and so die
duke of aumerle no good my lord let's fight with gentle words
 till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords
king richard ii o god o god that e'er this tongue of mine
 that laid the sentence of dread banishment
 on yon proud man should take it off again
 with words of sooth o that i were as great
 as is my grief or lesser than my name
 or that i could forget what i have been
 or not remember what i must be now
 swell'st thou proud heart i'll give thee scope to beat
 since foes have scope to beat both thee and me
duke of aumerle northumberland comes back from bolingbroke
king richard ii what must the king do now must he submit
 the king shall do it must he be deposed
 the king shall be contented must he lose
 the name of king o god's name let it go
 i'll give my jewels for a set of beads
 my gorgeous palace for a hermitage
 my gay apparel for an almsman's gown
 my figured goblets for a dish of wood
 my sceptre for a palmer's walking staff
 my subjects for a pair of carved saints
 and my large kingdom for a little grave
 a little little grave an obscure grave
 or i'll be buried in the king's highway
 some way of common trade where subjects feet
 may hourly trample on their sovereign's head
 for on my heart they tread now whilst i live
 and buried once why not upon my head
 aumerle thou weep'st my tenderhearted cousin
 we'll make foul weather with despised tears
 our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
 and make a dearth in this revolting land
 or shall we play the wantons with our woes
 and make some pretty match with shedding tears
 as thus to drop them still upon one place
 till they have fretted us a pair of graves
 within the earth and therein laidthere lies
 two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes
 would not this ill do well well well i see
 i talk but idly and you laugh at me
 most mighty prince my lord northumberland
 what says king bolingbroke will his majesty
 give richard leave to live till richard die
 you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay
northumberland my lord in the base court he doth attend
 to speak with you may it please you to come down
king richard ii down down i come like glistering phaethon
 wanting the manage of unruly jades
 in the base court base court where kings grow base
 to come at traitors calls and do them grace
 in the base court come down down court
 down king
 for nightowls shriek where mounting larks
 should sing
 exeunt from above
henry bolingbroke what says his majesty
northumberland sorrow and grief of heart
 makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
 yet he is come
 enter king richard and his attendants below
henry bolingbroke stand all apart
 and show fair duty to his majesty

henry bolingbroke my gracious lord i come but for mine own

 for do we must what force will have us do
 set on towards london cousin is it so
henry bolingbroke yea my good lord
king richard ii then i must not say no

act iii
scene iv langley the duke of york's garden
 enter the queen and two ladies
queen what sport shall we devise here in this garden
 to drive away the heavy thought of care
lady madam we'll play at bowls
queen twill make me think the world is full of rubs
 and that my fortune rubs against the bias
lady madam we'll dance
queen my legs can keep no measure in delight
 when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
 therefore no dancing girl some other sport
lady madam we'll tell tales
queen of sorrow or of joy
lady of either madam
queen of neither girl
 for of joy being altogether wanting
 it doth remember me the more of sorrow
 or if of grief being altogether had
 it adds more sorrow to my want of joy
 for what i have i need not to repeat
 and what i want it boots not to complain
lady madam i'll sing
queen tis well that thou hast cause
 but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
lady i could weep madam would it do you good
queen and i could sing would weeping do me good
 and never borrow any tear of thee
 enter a gardener and two servants
 but stay here come the gardeners
 let's step into the shadow of these trees
 my wretchedness unto a row of pins
 they'll talk of state for every one doth so
 against a change woe is forerun with woe
 queen and ladies retire
gardener go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
 which like unruly children make their sire
 stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
 give some supportance to the bending twigs
 go thou and like an executioner
 cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
 that look too lofty in our commonwealth
 all must be even in our government
 you thus employ'd i will go root away
 the noisome weeds which without profit suck
 the soil's fertility from wholesome flowers
servant why should we in the compass of a pale
 keep law and form and due proportion
 showing as in a model our firm estate
 when our seawalled garden the whole land
 is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up
 her fruittrees all upturned her hedges ruin'd
 her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
 swarming with caterpillars
gardener hold thy peace
 he that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
 hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
 the weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter
 that seem'd in eating him to hold him up
 are pluck'd up root and all by bolingbroke
 i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green
servant what are they dead
gardener they are and bolingbroke
 hath seized the wasteful king o what pity is it
 that he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
 as we this garden we at time of year
 do wound the bark the skin of our fruittrees
 lest being overproud in sap and blood
 with too much riches it confound itself
 had he done so to great and growing men
 they might have lived to bear and he to taste
 their fruits of duty superfluous branches
 we lop away that bearing boughs may live
 had he done so himself had borne the crown
 which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
servant what think you then the king shall be deposed
gardener depress'd he is already and deposed
 tis doubt he will be letters came last night
 to a dear friend of the good duke of york's
 that tell black tidings
queen o i am press'd to death through want of speaking
 coming forward
 thou old adam's likeness set to dress this garden
 how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
 what eve what serpent hath suggested thee
 to make a second fall of cursed man
 why dost thou say king richard is deposed
 darest thou thou little better thing than earth
 divine his downfall say where when and how
 camest thou by this ill tidings speak thou wretch
gardener pardon me madam little joy have i
 to breathe this news yet what i say is true
 king richard he is in the mighty hold
 of bolingbroke their fortunes both are weigh'd
 in your lord's scale is nothing but himself
 and some few vanities that make him light
 but in the balance of great bolingbroke
 besides himself are all the english peers
 and with that odds he weighs king richard down
 post you to london and you will find it so
 i speak no more than every one doth know
queen nimble mischance that art so light of foot
 doth not thy embassage belong to me
 and am i last that knows it o thou think'st
 to serve me last that i may longest keep
 thy sorrow in my breast come ladies go
 to meet at london london's king in woe
 what was i born to this that my sad look
 should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke
 gardener for telling me these news of woe
 pray god the plants thou graft'st may never grow
 exeunt queen and ladies
gardener poor queen so that thy state might be no worse
 i would my skill were subject to thy curse
 here did she fall a tear here in this place
 i'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace
 rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
 in the remembrance of a weeping queen

act iv
scene i westminster hall
 enter as to the parliament henry bolingbroke
 duke of aumerle northumberland henry percy lord
 fitzwater duke of surrey the bishop of carlisle
 the abbot of westminster and another lord herald
 officers and bagot
henry bolingbroke call forth bagot
 now bagot freely speak thy mind
 what thou dost know of noble gloucester's death
 who wrought it with the king and who perform'd
 the bloody office of his timeless end
bagot then set before my face the lord aumerle
henry bolingbroke cousin stand forth and look upon that man
bagot my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue
 scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd
 in that dead time when gloucester's death was plotted
 i heard you say is not my arm of length
 that reacheth from the restful english court
 as far as calais to mine uncle's head'
 amongst much other talk that very time
 i heard you say that you had rather refuse
 the offer of an hundred thousand crowns
 than bolingbroke's return to england
 adding withal how blest this land would be
 in this your cousin's death
duke of aumerle princes and noble lords
 what answer shall i make to this base man
 shall i so much dishonour my fair stars
 on equal terms to give him chastisement
 either i must or have mine honour soil'd
 with the attainder of his slanderous lips
 there is my gage the manual seal of death
 that marks thee out for hell i say thou liest
 and will maintain what thou hast said is false
 in thy heartblood though being all too base
 to stain the temper of my knightly sword
henry bolingbroke bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up
duke of aumerle excepting one i would he were the best
 in all this presence that hath moved me so
lord fitzwater if that thy valour stand on sympathy
 there is my gage aumerle in gage to thine
 by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st
 i heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it
 that thou wert cause of noble gloucester's death
 if thou deny'st it twenty times thou liest
 and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
 where it was forged with my rapier's point
duke of aumerle thou darest not coward live to see that day
lord fitzwater now by my soul i would it were this hour
duke of aumerle fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this
henry percy aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
 in this appeal as thou art all unjust
 and that thou art so there i throw my gage
 to prove it on thee to the extremest point
 of mortal breathing seize it if thou darest
duke of aumerle an if i do not may my hands rot off
 and never brandish more revengeful steel
 over the glittering helmet of my foe
lord i task the earth to the like forsworn aumerle
 and spur thee on with full as many lies
 as may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
 from sun to sun there is my honour's pawn
 engage it to the trial if thou darest
duke of aumerle who sets me else by heaven i'll throw at all
 i have a thousand spirits in one breast
 to answer twenty thousand such as you
duke of surrey my lord fitzwater i do remember well
 the very time aumerle and you did talk
lord fitzwater tis very true you were in presence then
 and you can witness with me this is true
duke of surrey as false by heaven as heaven itself is true
lord fitzwater surrey thou liest
duke of surrey dishonourable boy
 that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
 that it shall render vengeance and revenge
 till thou the liegiver and that lie do lie
 in earth as quiet as thy father's skull
 in proof whereof there is my honour's pawn
 engage it to the trial if thou darest
lord fitzwater how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
 if i dare eat or drink or breathe or live
 i dare meet surrey in a wilderness
 and spit upon him whilst i say he lies
 and lies and lies there is my bond of faith
 to tie thee to my strong correction
 as i intend to thrive in this new world
 aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
 besides i heard the banish'd norfolk say
 that thou aumerle didst send two of thy men
 to execute the noble duke at calais
duke of aumerle some honest christian trust me with a gage
 that norfolk lies here do i throw down this
 if he may be repeal'd to try his honour
henry bolingbroke these differences shall all rest under gage
 till norfolk be repeal'd repeal'd he shall be
 and though mine enemy restored again
 to all his lands and signories when he's return'd
 against aumerle we will enforce his trial
bishop of carlisle that honourable day shall ne'er be seen
 many a time hath banish'd norfolk fought
 for jesu christ in glorious christian field
 streaming the ensign of the christian cross
 against black pagans turks and saracens
 and toil'd with works of war retired himself
 to italy and there at venice gave
 his body to that pleasant country's earth
 and his pure soul unto his captain christ
 under whose colours he had fought so long
henry bolingbroke why bishop is norfolk dead
bishop of carlisle as surely as i live my lord
henry bolingbroke sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
 of good old abraham lords appellants
 your differences shall all rest under gage
 till we assign you to your days of trial
 enter duke of york attended
duke of york great duke of lancaster i come to thee
 from plumepluck'd richard who with willing soul
 adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
 to the possession of thy royal hand
 ascend his throne descending now from him
 and long live henry fourth of that name
henry bolingbroke in god's name i'll ascend the regal throne
bishop of carlisle marry god forbid
 worst in this royal presence may i speak
 yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
 would god that any in this noble presence
 were enough noble to be upright judge
 of noble richard then true noblesse would
 learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
 what subject can give sentence on his king
 and who sits here that is not richard's subject
 thieves are not judged but they are by to hear
 although apparent guilt be seen in them
 and shall the figure of god's majesty
 his captain steward deputyelect
 anointed crowned planted many years
 be judged by subject and inferior breath
 and he himself not present o forfend it god
 that in a christian climate souls refined
 should show so heinous black obscene a deed
 i speak to subjects and a subject speaks
 stirr'd up by god thus boldly for his king
 my lord of hereford here whom you call king
 is a foul traitor to proud hereford's king
 and if you crown him let me prophesy
 the blood of english shall manure the ground
 and future ages groan for this foul act
 peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels
 and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
 shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
 disorder horror fear and mutiny
 shall here inhabit and this land be call'd
 the field of golgotha and dead men's skulls
 o if you raise this house against this house
 it will the woefullest division prove
 that ever fell upon this cursed earth
 prevent it resist it let it not be so
 lest child child's children cry against you woe
northumberland well have you argued sir and for your pains
 of capital treason we arrest you here
 my lord of westminster be it your charge
 to keep him safely till his day of trial
 may it please you lords to grant the commons suit
henry bolingbroke fetch hither richard that in common view
 he may surrender so we shall proceed
 without suspicion
duke of york i will be his conduct
 exit
henry bolingbroke lords you that here are under our arrest
 procure your sureties for your days of answer
 little are we beholding to your love
 and little look'd for at your helping hands
 reenter duke of york with king richard ii and
 officers bearing the regalia
king richard ii alack why am i sent for to a king
 before i have shook off the regal thoughts
 wherewith i reign'd i hardly yet have learn'd
 to insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs
 give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
 to this submission yet i well remember
 the favours of these men were they not mine
 did they not sometime cry all hail to me
 so judas did to christ but he in twelve
 found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none
 god save the king will no man say amen
 am i both priest and clerk well then amen
 god save the king although i be not he
 and yet amen if heaven do think him me
 to do what service am i sent for hither
duke of york to do that office of thine own good will
 which tired majesty did make thee offer
 the resignation of thy state and crown
 to henry bolingbroke
king richard ii give me the crown here cousin seize the crown
 here cousin
 on this side my hand and on that side yours
 now is this golden crown like a deep well
 that owes two buckets filling one another
 the emptier ever dancing in the air
 the other down unseen and full of water
 that bucket down and full of tears am i
 drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high
henry bolingbroke i thought you had been willing to resign
king richard ii my crown i am but still my griefs are mine
 you may my glories and my state depose
 but not my griefs still am i king of those
henry bolingbroke part of your cares you give me with your crown
king richard ii your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
 my care is loss of care by old care done
 your care is gain of care by new care won
 the cares i give i have though given away
 they tend the crown yet still with me they stay
henry bolingbroke are you contented to resign the crown
king richard ii ay no no ay for i must nothing be
 therefore no no for i resign to thee
 now mark me how i will undo myself
 i give this heavy weight from off my head
 and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
 the pride of kingly sway from out my heart
 with mine own tears i wash away my balm
 with mine own hands i give away my crown
 with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
 with mine own breath release all duty's rites
 all pomp and majesty i do forswear
 my manors rents revenues i forego
 my acts decrees and statutes i deny
 god pardon all oaths that are broke to me
 god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee
 make me that nothing have with nothing grieved
 and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved
 long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit
 and soon lie richard in an earthly pit
 god save king harry unking'd richard says
 and send him many years of sunshine days
 what more remains
northumberland no more but that you read
 these accusations and these grievous crimes
 committed by your person and your followers
 against the state and profit of this land
 that by confessing them the souls of men
 may deem that you are worthily deposed
king richard ii must i do so and must i ravel out
 my weavedup folly gentle northumberland
 if thy offences were upon record
 would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
 to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst
 there shouldst thou find one heinous article
 containing the deposing of a king
 and cracking the strong warrant of an oath
 mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven
 nay all of you that stand and look upon
 whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
 though some of you with pilate wash your hands
 showing an outward pity yet you pilates
 have here deliver'd me to my sour cross
 and water cannot wash away your sin
northumberland my lord dispatch read o'er these articles
king richard ii mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see
 and yet salt water blinds them not so much
 but they can see a sort of traitors here
 nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself
 i find myself a traitor with the rest
 for i have given here my soul's consent
 to undeck the pompous body of a king
 made glory base and sovereignty a slave
 proud majesty a subject state a peasant
northumberland my lord
king richard ii no lord of thine thou haught insulting man
 nor no man's lord i have no name no title
 no not that name was given me at the font
 but tis usurp'd alack the heavy day
 that i have worn so many winters out
 and know not now what name to call myself
 o that i were a mockery king of snow
 standing before the sun of bolingbroke
 to melt myself away in waterdrops
 good king great king and yet not greatly good
 an if my word be sterling yet in england
 let it command a mirror hither straight
 that it may show me what a face i have
 since it is bankrupt of his majesty
henry bolingbroke go some of you and fetch a lookingglass
 exit an attendant
northumberland read o'er this paper while the glass doth come
king richard ii fiend thou torment'st me ere i come to hell
henry bolingbroke urge it no more my lord northumberland
northumberland the commons will not then be satisfied
king richard ii they shall be satisfied i'll read enough
 when i do see the very book indeed
 where all my sins are writ and that's myself
 reenter attendant with a glass
 give me the glass and therein will i read
 no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck
 so many blows upon this face of mine
 and made no deeper wounds o flattering glass
 like to my followers in prosperity
 thou dost beguile me was this face the face
 that every day under his household roof
 did keep ten thousand men was this the face
 that like the sun did make beholders wink
 was this the face that faced so many follies
 and was at last outfaced by bolingbroke
 a brittle glory shineth in this face
 as brittle as the glory is the face
 dashes the glass against the ground
 for there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers
 mark silent king the moral of this sport
 how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face
henry bolingbroke the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
 the shadow or your face
king richard ii say that again
 the shadow of my sorrow ha let's see
 tis very true my grief lies all within
 and these external manners of laments
 are merely shadows to the unseen grief
 that swells with silence in the tortured soul
 there lies the substance and i thank thee king
 for thy great bounty that not only givest
 me cause to wail but teachest me the way
 how to lament the cause i'll beg one boon
 and then be gone and trouble you no more
 shall i obtain it
henry bolingbroke name it fair cousin
king richard ii fair cousin i am greater than a king
 for when i was a king my flatterers
 were then but subjects being now a subject
 i have a king here to my flatterer
 being so great i have no need to beg
henry bolingbroke yet ask
king richard ii and shall i have
henry bolingbroke you shall
king richard ii then give me leave to go
henry bolingbroke whither
king richard ii whither you will so i were from your sights
henry bolingbroke go some of you convey him to the tower
king richard ii o good convey conveyers are you all
 that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall
 exeunt king richard ii some lords and a guard
henry bolingbroke on wednesday next we solemnly set down
 our coronation lords prepare yourselves
 exeunt all except the bishop of carlisle the abbot
 of westminster and duke of aumerle
abbot a woeful pageant have we here beheld
bishop of carlisle the woe's to come the children yet unborn
 shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
duke of aumerle you holy clergymen is there no plot
 to rid the realm of this pernicious blot
abbot my lord
 before i freely speak my mind herein
 you shall not only take the sacrament
 to bury mine intents but also to effect
 whatever i shall happen to devise
 i see your brows are full of discontent
 your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
 come home with me to supper and i'll lay
 a plot shall show us all a merry day

act v
scene i london a street leading to the tower
 enter queen and ladies
queen this way the king will come this is the way
 to julius caesar's illerected tower
 to whose flint bosom my condemned lord
 is doom'd a prisoner by proud bolingbroke
 here let us rest if this rebellious earth
 have any resting for her true king's queen
 enter king richard ii and guard
 but soft but see or rather do not see
 my fair rose wither yet look up behold
 that you in pity may dissolve to dew
 and wash him fresh again with truelove tears
 ah thou the model where old troy did stand
 thou map of honour thou king richard's tomb
 and not king richard thou most beauteous inn
 why should hardfavour'd grief be lodged in thee
 when triumph is become an alehouse guest
king richard ii join not with grief fair woman do not so
 to make my end too sudden learn good soul
 to think our former state a happy dream
 from which awaked the truth of what we are
 shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet
 to grim necessity and he and i
 will keep a league till death hie thee to france
 and cloister thee in some religious house
 our holy lives must win a new world's crown
 which our profane hours here have stricken down
queen what is my richard both in shape and mind
 transform'd and weaken'd hath bolingbroke deposed
 thine intellect hath he been in thy heart
 the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
 and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
 to be o'erpower'd and wilt thou pupillike
 take thy correction mildly kiss the rod
 and fawn on rage with base humility
 which art a lion and a king of beasts
king richard ii a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts
 i had been still a happy king of men
 good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france
 think i am dead and that even here thou takest
 as from my deathbed thy last living leave
 in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
 with good old folks and let them tell thee tales
 of woeful ages long ago betid
 and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
 tell thou the lamentable tale of me
 and send the hearers weeping to their beds
 for why the senseless brands will sympathize
 the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
 and in compassion weep the fire out
 and some will mourn in ashes some coalblack
 for the deposing of a rightful king
 enter northumberland and others
northumberland my lord the mind of bolingbroke is changed
 you must to pomfret not unto the tower
 and madam there is order ta'en for you
 with all swift speed you must away to france
king richard ii northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
 the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne
 the time shall not be many hours of age
 more than it is ere foul sin gathering head
 shalt break into corruption thou shalt think
 though he divide the realm and give thee half
 it is too little helping him to all
 and he shall think that thou which know'st the way
 to plant unrightful kings wilt know again
 being ne'er so little urged another way
 to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
 the love of wicked men converts to fear
 that fear to hate and hate turns one or both
 to worthy danger and deserved death
northumberland my guilt be on my head and there an end
 take leave and part for you must part forthwith
king richard ii doubly divorced bad men you violate
 a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me
 and then betwixt me and my married wife
 let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me
 and yet not so for with a kiss twas made
 part us northumberland i toward the north
 where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
 my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp
 she came adorned hither like sweet may
 sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day
queen and must we be divided must we part
king richard ii ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart
queen banish us both and send the king with me
northumberland that were some love but little policy
queen then whither he goes thither let me go
king richard ii so two together weeping make one woe
 weep thou for me in france i for thee here
 better far off than near be ne'er the near
 go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans
queen so longest way shall have the longest moans
king richard ii twice for one step i'll groan the way being short
 and piece the way out with a heavy heart
 come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief
 since wedding it there is such length in grief
 one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
 thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart
queen give me mine own again twere no good part
 to take on me to keep and kill thy heart
 so now i have mine own again be gone
 that i might strive to kill it with a groan
king richard ii we make woe wanton with this fond delay
 once more adieu the rest let sorrow say
 exeunt

act v
scene ii the duke of york's palace
 enter duke of york and duchess of york
duchess of york my lord you told me you would tell the rest
 when weeping made you break the story off
 of our two cousins coming into london
duke of york where did i leave
duchess of york at that sad stop my lord
 where rude misgovern'd hands from windows tops
 threw dust and rubbish on king richard's head
duke of york then as i said the duke great bolingbroke
 mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
 which his aspiring rider seem'd to know
 with slow but stately pace kept on his course
 whilst all tongues cried god save thee
 bolingbroke'
 you would have thought the very windows spake
 so many greedy looks of young and old
 through casements darted their desiring eyes
 upon his visage and that all the walls
 with painted imagery had said at once
 jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke'
 whilst he from the one side to the other turning
 bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck
 bespake them thus i thank you countrymen'
 and thus still doing thus he pass'd along
duchess of york alack poor richard where rode he the whilst
duke of york as in a theatre the eyes of men
 after a wellgraced actor leaves the stage
 are idly bent on him that enters next
 thinking his prattle to be tedious
 even so or with much more contempt men's eyes
 did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him'
 no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
 but dust was thrown upon his sacred head
 which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
 his face still combating with tears and smiles
 the badges of his grief and patience
 that had not god for some strong purpose steel'd
 the hearts of men they must perforce have melted
 and barbarism itself have pitied him
 but heaven hath a hand in these events
 to whose high will we bound our calm contents
 to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
 whose state and honour i for aye allow
duchess of york here comes my son aumerle
duke of york aumerle that was
 but that is lost for being richard's friend
 and madam you must call him rutland now

 which for some reasons i would not have seen
duke of york which for some reasons sir i mean to see

 for gay apparel gainst the triumph day
duke of york bound to himself what doth he with a bond
 that he is bound to wife thou art a fool

 and rob me of a happy mother's name
 is he not like thee is he not thine own
duke of york thou fond mad woman
 wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
 a dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament
 and interchangeably set down their hands
 to kill the king at oxford
duchess of york he shall be none
 we'll keep him here then what is that to him
duke of york away fond woman were he twenty times my son
 i would appeach him
duchess of york hadst thou groan'd for him
 as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
 but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect
 that i have been disloyal to thy bed
 and that he is a bastard not thy son
 sweet york sweet husband be not of that mind
 he is as like thee as a man may be
 not like to me or any of my kin
 and yet i love him
duke of york make way unruly woman
 exit
duchess of york after aumerle mount thee upon his horse
 spur post and get before him to the king
 and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
 i'll not be long behind though i be old
 i doubt not but to ride as fast as york
 and never will i rise up from the ground
 till bolingbroke have pardon'd thee away be gone

scene iii a royal palace
 enter henry bolingbroke henry percy and other lords
henry bolingbroke can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
 tis full three months since i did see him last
 if any plague hang over us tis he
 i would to god my lords he might be found
 inquire at london mongst the taverns there
 for there they say he daily doth frequent
 with unrestrained loose companions
 even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
 and beat our watch and rob our passengers
 which he young wanton and effeminate boy
 takes on the point of honour to support
 so dissolute a crew
henry percy my lord some two days since i saw the prince
 and told him of those triumphs held at oxford
henry bolingbroke and what said the gallant
henry percy his answer was he would unto the stews
 and from the common'st creature pluck a glove
 and wear it as a favour and with that
 he would unhorse the lustiest challenger
henry bolingbroke as dissolute as desperate yet through both
 i see some sparks of better hope which elder years
 may happily bring forth but who comes here
 enter duke of aumerle
duke of aumerle where is the king
henry bolingbroke what means our cousin that he stares and looks
 so wildly
duke of aumerle god save your grace i do beseech your majesty
 to have some conference with your grace alone
henry bolingbroke withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone
 exeunt henry percy and lords
 what is the matter with our cousin now
duke of aumerle for ever may my knees grow to the earth
 my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
 unless a pardon ere i rise or speak
henry bolingbroke intended or committed was this fault
 if on the first how heinous e'er it be
 to win thy afterlove i pardon thee
duke of aumerle then give me leave that i may turn the key
 that no man enter till my tale be done
henry bolingbroke have thy desire

 i do repent me read not my name there
 my heart is not confederate with my hand
duke of york it was villain ere thy hand did set it down
 i tore it from the traitor's bosom king
 fear and not love begets his penitence
 forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
 a serpent that will sting thee to the heart
henry bolingbroke o heinous strong and bold conspiracy
 o loyal father of a treacherous son
 thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
 from when this stream through muddy passages
 hath held his current and defiled himself
 thy overflow of good converts to bad
 and thy abundant goodness shall excuse
 this deadly blot in thy digressing son
duke of york so shall my virtue be his vice's bawd
 and he shall spend mine honour with his shame
 as thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold
 mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
 or my shamed life in his dishonour lies
 thou kill'st me in his life giving him breath
 the traitor lives the true man's put to death
duchess of york within what ho my liege for god's sake
 let me in
henry bolingbroke what shrillvoiced suppliant makes this eager cry
duchess of york a woman and thy aunt great king tis i

 and now changed to the beggar and the king'
 my dangerous cousin let your mother in

duke of york if thou do pardon whosoever pray
 more sins for this forgiveness prosper may

duchess of york sweet york be patient hear me gentle liege
 kneels

duchess of york not yet i thee beseech

 till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
 by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy
duke of aumerle unto my mother's prayers i bend my knee
duke of york against them both my true joints bended be
 ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace
duchess of york pleads he in earnest look upon his face
 his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest
 his words come from his mouth ours from our breast
 he prays but faintly and would be denied
 we pray with heart and soul and all beside
 his weary joints would gladly rise i know
 our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow
 his prayers are full of false hypocrisy
 ours of true zeal and deep integrity
 our prayers do outpray his then let them have
 that mercy which true prayer ought to have
henry bolingbroke good aunt stand up
duchess of york nay do not say stand up'
 say pardon first and afterwards stand up'
 and if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
 pardon should be the first word of thy speech
 i never long'd to hear a word till now
 say pardon king let pity teach thee how
 the word is short but not so short as sweet
 no word like pardon for kings mouths so meet
duke of york speak it in french king say pardonne moi'
duchess of york dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
 ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord
 that set'st the word itself against the word
 speak pardon as tis current in our land
 the chopping french we do not understand
 thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
 or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
 that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
 pity may move thee pardon to rehearse
henry bolingbroke good aunt stand up
duchess of york i do not sue to stand
 pardon is all the suit i have in hand
henry bolingbroke i pardon him as god shall pardon me
duchess of york o happy vantage of a kneeling knee
 yet am i sick for fear speak it again
 twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain
 but makes one pardon strong
henry bolingbroke with all my heart
 i pardon him
duchess of york a god on earth thou art
henry bolingbroke but for our trusty brotherinlaw and the abbot
 with all the rest of that consorted crew
 destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
 good uncle help to order several powers
 to oxford or where'er these traitors are
 they shall not live within this world i swear
 but i will have them if i once know where
 uncle farewell and cousin too adieu
 your mother well hath pray'd and prove you true

 enter king richard
king richard ii i have been studying how i may compare
 this prison where i live unto the world
 and for because the world is populous
 and here is not a creature but myself
 i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out
 my brain i'll prove the female to my soul
 my soul the father and these two beget
 a generation of stillbreeding thoughts
 and these same thoughts people this little world
 in humours like the people of this world
 for no thought is contented the better sort
 as thoughts of things divine are intermix'd
 with scruples and do set the word itself
 against the word
 as thus come little ones and then again
 it is as hard to come as for a camel
 to thread the postern of a small needle's eye'
 thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
 unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
 may tear a passage through the flinty ribs
 of this hard world my ragged prison walls
 and for they cannot die in their own pride
 thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
 that they are not the first of fortune's slaves
 nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
 who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
 that many have and others must sit there
 and in this thought they find a kind of ease
 bearing their own misfortunes on the back
 of such as have before endured the like
 thus play i in one person many people
 and none contented sometimes am i king
 then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
 and so i am then crushing penury
 persuades me i was better when a king
 then am i king'd again and by and by
 think that i am unking'd by bolingbroke
 and straight am nothing but whate'er i be
 nor i nor any man that but man is
 with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased
 with being nothing music do i hear
 music
 ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is
 when time is broke and no proportion kept
 so is it in the music of men's lives
 and here have i the daintiness of ear
 to cheque time broke in a disorder'd string
 but for the concord of my state and time
 had not an ear to hear my true time broke
 i wasted time and now doth time waste me
 for now hath time made me his numbering clock
 my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
 their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
 whereto my finger like a dial's point
 is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
 now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
 are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
 which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans
 show minutes times and hours but my time
 runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy
 while i stand fooling here his jack o the clock
 this music mads me let it sound no more
 for though it have holp madmen to their wits
 in me it seems it will make wise men mad
 yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
 for tis a sign of love and love to richard
 is a strange brooch in this allhating world
 enter a groom of the stable
groom hail royal prince
king richard ii thanks noble peer
 the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
 what art thou and how comest thou hither
 where no man never comes but that sad dog
 that brings me food to make misfortune live
groom i was a poor groom of thy stable king
 when thou wert king who travelling towards york
 with much ado at length have gotten leave
 to look upon my sometimes royal master's face
 o how it yearn'd my heart when i beheld
 in london streets that coronationday
 when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary
 that horse that thou so often hast bestrid
 that horse that i so carefully have dress'd
king richard ii rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend
 how went he under him
groom so proudly as if he disdain'd the ground
king richard ii so proud that bolingbroke was on his back
 that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
 this hand hath made him proud with clapping him
 would he not stumble would he not fall down
 since pride must have a fall and break the neck
 of that proud man that did usurp his back
 forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee
 since thou created to be awed by man
 wast born to bear i was not made a horse
 and yet i bear a burthen like an ass
 spurr'd gall'd and tired by jouncing bolingbroke
 enter keeper with a dish
keeper fellow give place here is no longer stay

groom what my tongue dares not that my heart shall say

 lately came from the king commands the contrary

 patience is stale and i am weary of it

keeper help help help
 enter exton and servants armed
king richard ii how now what means death in this rude assault
 villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument
 snatching an axe from a servant and killing him
 go thou and fill another room in hell
 he kills another then exton strikes him down
 that hand shall burn in neverquenching fire
 that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand
 hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land
 mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
 whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
 dies
exton as full of valour as of royal blood
 both have i spill'd o would the deed were good
 for now the devil that told me i did well
 says that this deed is chronicled in hell

 nor do i thee though i did wish him dead
 i hate the murderer love him murdered
 the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour
 but neither my good word nor princely favour
 with cain go wander through shades of night
 and never show thy head by day nor light
 lords i protest my soul is full of woe
 that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
 come mourn with me for that i do lament
 and put on sullen black incontinent
 i'll make a voyage to the holy land

scene i london a street
 enter gloucester solus
gloucester now is the winter of our discontent
 made glorious summer by this sun of york
 and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
 in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
 now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
 our bruised arms hung up for monuments
 our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
 our dreadful marches to delightful measures
 grimvisaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front
 and now instead of mounting barded steeds
 to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
 he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
 to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
 but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks
 nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
 i that am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty
 to strut before a wanton ambling nymph
 i that am curtail'd of this fair proportion
 cheated of feature by dissembling nature
 deformed unfinish'd sent before my time
 into this breathing world scarce half made up
 and that so lamely and unfashionable
 that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
 why i in this weak piping time of peace
 have no delight to pass away the time
 unless to spy my shadow in the sun
 and descant on mine own deformity
 and therefore since i cannot prove a lover
 to entertain these fair wellspoken days
 i am determined to prove a villain
 and hate the idle pleasures of these days
 plots have i laid inductions dangerous
 by drunken prophecies libels and dreams
 to set my brother clarence and the king
 in deadly hate the one against the other
 and if king edward be as true and just
 as i am subtle false and treacherous
 this day should clarence closely be mew'd up
 about a prophecy which says that g'
 of edward's heirs the murderer shall be
 dive thoughts down to my soul here
 clarence comes
 enter clarence guarded and brakenbury
 brother good day what means this armed guard
 that waits upon your grace
clarence his majesty
 tendering my person's safety hath appointed
 this conduct to convey me to the tower
gloucester upon what cause
clarence because my name is george
gloucester alack my lord that fault is none of yours
 he should for that commit your godfathers
 o belike his majesty hath some intent
 that you shall be newchristen'd in the tower
 but what's the matter clarence may i know
clarence yea richard when i know for i protest
 as yet i do not but as i can learn
 he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
 and from the crossrow plucks the letter g
 and says a wizard told him that by g
 his issue disinherited should be
 and for my name of george begins with g
 it follows in his thought that i am he
 these as i learn and such like toys as these
 have moved his highness to commit me now
gloucester why this it is when men are ruled by women
 tis not the king that sends you to the tower
 my lady grey his wife clarence tis she
 that tempers him to this extremity
 was it not she and that good man of worship
 anthony woodville her brother there
 that made him send lord hastings to the tower
 from whence this present day he is deliver'd
 we are not safe clarence we are not safe
clarence by heaven i think there's no man is secure
 but the queen's kindred and nightwalking heralds
 that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
 heard ye not what an humble suppliant
 lord hastings was to her for his delivery
gloucester humbly complaining to her deity
 got my lord chamberlain his liberty
 i'll tell you what i think it is our way
 if we will keep in favour with the king
 to be her men and wear her livery
 the jealous o'erworn widow and herself
 since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen
 are mighty gossips in this monarchy
brakenbury i beseech your graces both to pardon me
 his majesty hath straitly given in charge
 that no man shall have private conference
 of what degree soever with his brother
gloucester even so an't please your worship brakenbury
 you may partake of any thing we say
 we speak no treason man we say the king
 is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
 well struck in years fair and not jealous
 we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot
 a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
 and that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks
 how say you sir can you deny all this
brakenbury with this my lord myself have nought to do
gloucester naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow
 he that doth naught with her excepting one
 were best he do it secretly alone
brakenbury what one my lord
gloucester her husband knave wouldst thou betray me
brakenbury i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal
 forbear your conference with the noble duke
clarence we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey
gloucester we are the queen's abjects and must obey
 brother farewell i will unto the king
 and whatsoever you will employ me in
 were it to call king edward's widow sister
 i will perform it to enfranchise you
 meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
 touches me deeper than you can imagine
clarence i know it pleaseth neither of us well
gloucester well your imprisonment shall not be long
 meantime have patience
clarence i must perforce farewell
 exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard
gloucester go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return
 simple plain clarence i do love thee so
 that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven
 if heaven will take the present at our hands
 but who comes here the newdeliver'd hastings
 enter hastings
hastings good time of day unto my gracious lord
gloucester as much unto my good lord chamberlain
 well are you welcome to the open air
 how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment
hastings with patience noble lord as prisoners must
 but i shall live my lord to give them thanks
 that were the cause of my imprisonment
gloucester no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too
 for they that were your enemies are his
 and have prevail'd as much on him as you
hastings more pity that the eagle should be mew'd
 while kites and buzzards prey at liberty
gloucester what news abroad
hastings no news so bad abroad as this at home
 the king is sickly weak and melancholy
 and his physicians fear him mightily
gloucester now by saint paul this news is bad indeed
 o he hath kept an evil diet long
 and overmuch consumed his royal person
 tis very grievous to be thought upon
 what is he in his bed
hastings he is
gloucester go you before and i will follow you
 exit hastings
 he cannot live i hope and must not die
 till george be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven
 i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence
 with lies well steel'd with weighty arguments
 and if i fall not in my deep intent
 clarence hath not another day to live
 which done god take king edward to his mercy
 and leave the world for me to bustle in
 for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter
 what though i kill'd her husband and her father
 the readiest way to make the wench amends
 is to become her husband and her father
 the which will i not all so much for love
 as for another secret close intent
 by marrying her which i must reach unto
 but yet i run before my horse to market
 clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns
 when they are gone then must i count my gains

 enter the corpse of king henry the sixth gentlemen
 with halberds to guard it lady anne being the mourner
lady anne set down set down your honourable load
 if honour may be shrouded in a hearse
 whilst i awhile obsequiously lament
 the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
 poor keycold figure of a holy king
 pale ashes of the house of lancaster
 thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
 be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost
 to hear the lamentations of poor anne
 wife to thy edward to thy slaughter'd son
 stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
 lo in these windows that let forth thy life
 i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
 cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes
 cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it
 cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
 more direful hap betide that hated wretch
 that makes us wretched by the death of thee
 than i can wish to adders spiders toads
 or any creeping venom'd thing that lives
 if ever he have child abortive be it
 prodigious and untimely brought to light
 whose ugly and unnatural aspect
 may fright the hopeful mother at the view
 and that be heir to his unhappiness
 if ever he have wife let her he made
 a miserable by the death of him
 as i am made by my poor lord and thee
 come now towards chertsey with your holy load
 taken from paul's to be interred there
 and still as you are weary of the weight
 rest you whiles i lament king henry's corse
 enter gloucester
gloucester stay you that bear the corse and set it down
lady anne what black magician conjures up this fiend
 to stop devoted charitable deeds
gloucester villains set down the corse or by saint paul
 i'll make a corse of him that disobeys
gentleman my lord stand back and let the coffin pass
gloucester unmanner'd dog stand thou when i command
 advance thy halbert higher than my breast
 or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot
 and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
lady anne what do you tremble are you all afraid
 alas i blame you not for you are mortal
 and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
 avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
 thou hadst but power over his mortal body
 his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
gloucester sweet saint for charity be not so curst
lady anne foul devil for god's sake hence and trouble us not
 for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
 fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
 if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
 behold this pattern of thy butcheries
 o gentlemen see see dead henry's wounds
 open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh
 blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
 for tis thy presence that exhales this blood
 from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
 thy deed inhuman and unnatural
 provokes this deluge most unnatural
 o god which this blood madest revenge his death
 o earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death
 either heaven with lightning strike the
 murderer dead
 or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
 as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
 which his hellgovern'd arm hath butchered
gloucester lady you know no rules of charity
 which renders good for bad blessings for curses
lady anne villain thou know'st no law of god nor man
 no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
gloucester but i know none and therefore am no beast
lady anne o wonderful when devils tell the truth
gloucester more wonderful when angels are so angry
 vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
 of these supposedevils to give me leave
 by circumstance but to acquit myself
lady anne vouchsafe defused infection of a man
 for these known evils but to give me leave
 by circumstance to curse thy cursed self
gloucester fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
 some patient leisure to excuse myself
lady anne fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
 no excuse current but to hang thyself
gloucester by such despair i should accuse myself
lady anne and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused
 for doing worthy vengeance on thyself
 which didst unworthy slaughter upon others
gloucester say that i slew them not
lady anne why then they are not dead
 but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
gloucester i did not kill your husband
lady anne why then he is alive
gloucester nay he is dead and slain by edward's hand
lady anne in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw
 thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood
 the which thou once didst bend against her breast
 but that thy brothers beat aside the point
gloucester i was provoked by her slanderous tongue
 which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
lady anne thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
 which never dreamt on aught but butcheries
 didst thou not kill this king
gloucester i grant ye
lady anne dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too
 thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
 o he was gentle mild and virtuous
gloucester the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him
lady anne he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
gloucester let him thank me that holp to send him thither
 for he was fitter for that place than earth
lady anne and thou unfit for any place but hell
gloucester yes one place else if you will hear me name it
lady anne some dungeon
gloucester your bedchamber
lady anne i'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest
gloucester so will it madam till i lie with you
lady anne i hope so
gloucester i know so but gentle lady anne
 to leave this keen encounter of our wits
 and fall somewhat into a slower method
 is not the causer of the timeless deaths
 of these plantagenets henry and edward
 as blameful as the executioner
lady anne thou art the cause and most accursed effect
gloucester your beauty was the cause of that effect
 your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep
 to undertake the death of all the world
 so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom
lady anne if i thought that i tell thee homicide
 these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
gloucester these eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck
 you should not blemish it if i stood by
 as all the world is cheered by the sun
 so i by that it is my day my life
lady anne black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life
gloucester curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
lady anne i would i were to be revenged on thee
gloucester it is a quarrel most unnatural
 to be revenged on him that loveth you
lady anne it is a quarrel just and reasonable
 to be revenged on him that slew my husband
gloucester he that bereft thee lady of thy husband
 did it to help thee to a better husband
lady anne his better doth not breathe upon the earth
gloucester he lives that loves thee better than he could
lady anne name him
gloucester plantagenet
lady anne why that was he
gloucester the selfsame name but one of better nature
lady anne where is he
gloucester here
 she spitteth at him
 why dost thou spit at me
lady anne would it were mortal poison for thy sake
gloucester never came poison from so sweet a place
lady anne never hung poison on a fouler toad
 out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes
gloucester thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
lady anne would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
gloucester i would they were that i might die at once
 for now they kill me with a living death
 those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
 shamed their aspect with store of childish drops
 these eyes that never shed remorseful tear
 no when my father york and edward wept
 to hear the piteous moan that rutland made
 when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him
 nor when thy warlike father like a child
 told the sad story of my father's death
 and twenty times made pause to sob and weep
 that all the standersby had wet their cheeks
 like trees bedash'd with rain in that sad time
 my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
 and what these sorrows could not thence exhale
 thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
 i never sued to friend nor enemy
 my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
 but now thy beauty is proposed my fee
 my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
 she looks scornfully at him
 teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made
 for kissing lady not for such contempt
 if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
 lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword
 which if thou please to hide in this true bosom
 and let the soul forth that adoreth thee
 i lay it naked to the deadly stroke
 and humbly beg the death upon my knee
 he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword
 nay do not pause for i did kill king henry
 but twas thy beauty that provoked me

lady anne what is it
gloucester that it would please thee leave these sad designs

 at chertsey monastery this noble king
 and wet his grave with my repentant tears
 i will with all expedient duty see you
 for divers unknown reasons i beseech you
 grant me this boon
lady anne with all my heart and much it joys me too
 to see you are become so penitent

 exeunt lady anne tressel and berkeley
gloucester sirs take up the corse
gentlemen towards chertsey noble lord
gloucester no to whitefriars there attend my coining
 exeunt all but gloucester
 was ever woman in this humour woo'd
 was ever woman in this humour won
 i'll have her but i will not keep her long
 what i that kill'd her husband and his father
 to take her in her heart's extremest hate
 with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
 the bleeding witness of her hatred by
 having god her conscience and these bars
 against me
 and i nothing to back my suit at all
 but the plain devil and dissembling looks
 and yet to win her all the world to nothing
 ha
 hath she forgot already that brave prince
 edward her lord whom i some three months since
 stabb'd in my angry mood at tewksbury
 a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
 framed in the prodigality of nature
 young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
 the spacious world cannot again afford
 and will she yet debase her eyes on me
 that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
 and made her widow to a woful bed
 on me whose all not equals edward's moiety
 on me that halt and am unshapen thus
 my dukedom to a beggarly denier
 i do mistake my person all this while
 upon my life she finds although i cannot
 myself to be a marvellous proper man
 i'll be at charges for a lookingglass
 and entertain some score or two of tailors
 to study fashions to adorn my body
 since i am crept in favour with myself
 will maintain it with some little cost
 but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave
 and then return lamenting to my love
 shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass
 that i may see my shadow as i pass
 exit

act i
scene iii the palace
 enter queen elizabeth rivers and grey
rivers have patience madam there's no doubt his majesty
 will soon recover his accustom'd health
grey in that you brook it in it makes him worse
 therefore for god's sake entertain good comfort
 and cheer his grace with quick and merry words
queen elizabeth if he were dead what would betide of me
rivers no other harm but loss of such a lord
queen elizabeth the loss of such a lord includes all harm
grey the heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
 to be your comforter when he is gone
queen elizabeth oh he is young and his minority
 is put unto the trust of richard gloucester
 a man that loves not me nor none of you
rivers is it concluded that he shall be protector
queen elizabeth it is determined not concluded yet
 but so it must be if the king miscarry
 enter buckingham and derby
grey here come the lords of buckingham and derby
buckingham good time of day unto your royal grace
derby god make your majesty joyful as you have been
queen elizabeth the countess richmond good my lord of derby
 to your good prayers will scarcely say amen
 yet derby notwithstanding she's your wife
 and loves not me be you good lord assured
 i hate not you for her proud arrogance
derby i do beseech you either not believe
 the envious slanders of her false accusers
 or if she be accused in true report
 bear with her weakness which i think proceeds
 from wayward sickness and no grounded malice
rivers saw you the king today my lord of derby

 are come from visiting his majesty
queen elizabeth what likelihood of his amendment lords
buckingham madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully

queen elizabeth would all were well but that will never be
 i fear our happiness is at the highest
 enter gloucester hastings and dorset
gloucester they do me wrong and i will not endure it
 who are they that complain unto the king
 that i forsooth am stern and love them not
 by holy paul they love his grace but lightly
 that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
 because i cannot flatter and speak fair
 smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog
 duck with french nods and apish courtesy
 i must be held a rancorous enemy
 cannot a plain man live and think no harm
 but thus his simple truth must be abused
 by silken sly insinuating jacks
rivers to whom in all this presence speaks your grace
gloucester to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
 when have i injured thee when done thee wrong
 or thee or thee or any of your faction
 a plague upon you all his royal person
 whom god preserve better than you would wish
 cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile
 but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
queen elizabeth brother of gloucester you mistake the matter
 the king of his own royal disposition
 and not provoked by any suitor else
 aiming belike at your interior hatred
 which in your outward actions shows itself
 against my kindred brothers and myself
 makes him to send that thereby he may gather
 the ground of your illwill and so remove it
gloucester i cannot tell the world is grown so bad
 that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
 since every jack became a gentleman
 there's many a gentle person made a jack
queen elizabeth come come we know your meaning brother
 gloucester
 you envy my advancement and my friends'
 god grant we never may have need of you
gloucester meantime god grants that we have need of you
 your brother is imprison'd by your means
 myself disgraced and the nobility
 held in contempt whilst many fair promotions
 are daily given to ennoble those
 that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
queen elizabeth by him that raised me to this careful height
 from that contented hap which i enjoy'd
 i never did incense his majesty
 against the duke of clarence but have been
 an earnest advocate to plead for him
 my lord you do me shameful injury
 falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
gloucester you may deny that you were not the cause
 of my lord hastings late imprisonment
rivers she may my lord for
gloucester she may lord rivers why who knows not so
 she may do more sir than denying that
 she may help you to many fair preferments
 and then deny her aiding hand therein
 and lay those honours on your high deserts
 what may she not she may yea marry may she
rivers what marry may she
gloucester what marry may she marry with a king
 a bachelor a handsome stripling too
 i wis your grandam had a worser match
queen elizabeth my lord of gloucester i have too long borne
 your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
 by heaven i will acquaint his majesty
 with those gross taunts i often have endured
 i had rather be a country servantmaid
 than a great queen with this condition
 to be thus taunted scorn'd and baited at
 enter queen margaret behind
 small joy have i in being england's queen
queen margaret and lessen'd be that small god i beseech thee
 thy honour state and seat is due to me
gloucester what threat you me with telling of the king
 tell him and spare not look what i have said
 i will avouch in presence of the king
 i dare adventure to be sent to the tower
 tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
queen margaret out devil i remember them too well
 thou slewest my husband henry in the tower
 and edward my poor son at tewksbury
gloucester ere you were queen yea or your husband king
 i was a packhorse in his great affairs
 a weederout of his proud adversaries
 a liberal rewarder of his friends
 to royalize his blood i spilt mine own
queen margaret yea and much better blood than his or thine
gloucester in all which time you and your husband grey
 were factious for the house of lancaster
 and rivers so were you was not your husband
 in margaret's battle at saint alban's slain
 let me put in your minds if you forget
 what you have been ere now and what you are
 withal what i have been and what i am
queen margaret a murderous villain and so still thou art
gloucester poor clarence did forsake his father warwick
 yea and forswore himselfwhich jesu pardon
queen margaret which god revenge
gloucester to fight on edward's party for the crown
 and for his meed poor lord he is mew'd up
 i would to god my heart were flint like edward's
 or edward's soft and pitiful like mine
 i am too childishfoolish for this world
queen margaret hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world
 thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
rivers my lord of gloucester in those busy days
 which here you urge to prove us enemies
 we follow'd then our lord our lawful king
 so should we you if you should be our king
gloucester if i should be i had rather be a pedlar
 far be it from my heart the thought of it
queen elizabeth as little joy my lord as you suppose
 you should enjoy were you this country's king
 as little joy may you suppose in me
 that i enjoy being the queen thereof
queen margaret a little joy enjoys the queen thereof
 for i am she and altogether joyless
 i can no longer hold me patient
 advancing
 hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
 in sharing that which you have pill'd from me
 which of you trembles not that looks on me
 if not that i being queen you bow like subjects
 yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels
 o gentle villain do not turn away
gloucester foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight
queen margaret but repetition of what thou hast marr'd
 that will i make before i let thee go
gloucester wert thou not banished on pain of death
queen margaret i was but i do find more pain in banishment
 than death can yield me here by my abode
 a husband and a son thou owest to me
 and thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
 the sorrow that i have by right is yours
 and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
gloucester the curse my noble father laid on thee
 when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
 and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes
 and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout
 steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland
 his curses then from bitterness of soul
 denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee
 and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed
queen elizabeth so just is god to right the innocent
hastings o twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
 and the most merciless that e'er was heard of
rivers tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
dorset no man but prophesied revenge for it
buckingham northumberland then present wept to see it
queen margaret what were you snarling all before i came
 ready to catch each other by the throat
 and turn you all your hatred now on me
 did york's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
 that henry's death my lovely edward's death
 their kingdom's loss my woful banishment
 could all but answer for that peevish brat
 can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
 why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
 if not by war by surfeit die your king
 as ours by murder to make him a king
 edward thy son which now is prince of wales
 for edward my son which was prince of wales
 die in his youth by like untimely violence
 thyself a queen for me that was a queen
 outlive thy glory like my wretched self
 long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss
 and see another as i see thee now
 deck'd in thy rights as thou art stall'd in mine
 long die thy happy days before thy death
 and after many lengthen'd hours of grief
 die neither mother wife nor england's queen
 rivers and dorset you were standers by
 and so wast thou lord hastings when my son
 was stabb'd with bloody daggers god i pray him
 that none of you may live your natural age
 but by some unlook'd accident cut off
gloucester have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd hag
queen margaret and leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
 if heaven have any grievous plague in store
 exceeding those that i can wish upon thee
 o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
 and then hurl down their indignation
 on thee the troubler of the poor world's peace
 the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
 thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest
 and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
 no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
 unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
 affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
 thou elvishmark'd abortive rooting hog
 thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
 the slave of nature and the son of hell
 thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb
 thou loathed issue of thy father's loins
 thou rag of honour thou detested
gloucester margaret
queen margaret richard
gloucester ha
queen margaret i call thee not
gloucester i cry thee mercy then for i had thought
 that thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names
queen margaret why so i did but look'd for no reply
 o let me make the period to my curse
gloucester tis done by me and ends in margaret'
queen elizabeth thus have you breathed your curse against yourself
queen margaret poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
 why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
 whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
 fool fool thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself
 the time will come when thou shalt wish for me
 to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad
hastings falseboding woman end thy frantic curse
 lest to thy harm thou move our patience
queen margaret foul shame upon you you have all moved mine
rivers were you well served you would be taught your duty
queen margaret to serve me well you all should do me duty
 teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
 o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
dorset dispute not with her she is lunatic
queen margaret peace master marquess you are malapert
 your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current
 o that your young nobility could judge
 what twere to lose it and be miserable
 they that stand high have many blasts to shake them
 and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
gloucester good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess
dorset it toucheth you my lord as much as me
gloucester yea and much more but i was born so high
 our aery buildeth in the cedar's top
 and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
queen margaret and turns the sun to shade alas alas
 witness my son now in the shade of death
 whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
 hath in eternal darkness folded up
 your aery buildeth in our aery's nest
 o god that seest it do not suffer it
 as it was won with blood lost be it so
buckingham have done for shame if not for charity
queen margaret urge neither charity nor shame to me
 uncharitably with me have you dealt
 and shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd
 my charity is outrage life my shame
 and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage
buckingham have done have done
queen margaret o princely buckingham i'll kiss thy hand
 in sign of league and amity with thee
 now fair befal thee and thy noble house
 thy garments are not spotted with our blood
 nor thou within the compass of my curse
buckingham nor no one here for curses never pass
 the lips of those that breathe them in the air
queen margaret i'll not believe but they ascend the sky
 and there awake god's gentlesleeping peace
 o buckingham take heed of yonder dog
 look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
 his venom tooth will rankle to the death
 have not to do with him beware of him
 sin death and hell have set their marks on him
 and all their ministers attend on him
gloucester what doth she say my lord of buckingham
buckingham nothing that i respect my gracious lord
queen margaret what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel
 and soothe the devil that i warn thee from
 o but remember this another day
 when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
 and say poor margaret was a prophetess
 live each of you the subjects to his hate
 and he to yours and all of you to god's
 exit
hastings my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses
rivers and so doth mine i muse why she's at liberty
gloucester i cannot blame her by god's holy mother
 she hath had too much wrong and i repent
 my part thereof that i have done to her
queen elizabeth i never did her any to my knowledge
gloucester but you have all the vantage of her wrong
 i was too hot to do somebody good
 that is too cold in thinking of it now
 marry as for clarence he is well repaid
 he is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
 god pardon them that are the cause of it
rivers a virtuous and a christianlike conclusion
 to pray for them that have done scathe to us
gloucester so do i ever
 aside
 being welladvised
 for had i cursed now i had cursed myself
 enter catesby
catesby madam his majesty doth call for you
 and for your grace and you my noble lords
queen elizabeth catesby we come lords will you go with us
rivers madam we will attend your grace
 exeunt all but gloucester
gloucester i do the wrong and first begin to brawl
 the secret mischiefs that i set abroach
 i lay unto the grievous charge of others
 clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness
 i do beweep to many simple gulls
 namely to hastings derby buckingham
 and say it is the queen and her allies
 that stir the king against the duke my brother
 now they believe it and withal whet me
 to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey
 but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture
 tell them that god bids us do good for evil
 and thus i clothe my naked villany
 with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ
 and seem a saint when most i play the devil
 enter two murderers
 but soft here come my executioners
 how now my hardy stout resolved mates
 are you now going to dispatch this deed
first murderer we are my lord and come to have the warrant
 that we may be admitted where he is
gloucester well thought upon i have it here about me
 gives the warrant
 when you have done repair to crosby place
 but sirs be sudden in the execution
 withal obdurate do not hear him plead
 for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps
 may move your hearts to pity if you mark him
first murderer tush
 fear not my lord we will not stand to prate
 talkers are no good doers be assured
 we come to use our hands and not our tongues
gloucester your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes drop tears
 i like you lads about your business straight
 go go dispatch
first murderer we will my noble lord
 exeunt
 king richard iii
act i
scene iv london the tower
 enter clarence and brakenbury
brakenbury why looks your grace so heavily today
clarence o i have pass'd a miserable night
 so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams
 that as i am a christian faithful man
 i would not spend another such a night
 though twere to buy a world of happy days
 so full of dismal terror was the time
brakenbury what was your dream i long to hear you tell it
clarence methoughts that i had broken from the tower
 and was embark'd to cross to burgundy
 and in my company my brother gloucester
 who from my cabin tempted me to walk
 upon the hatches thence we looked toward england
 and cited up a thousand fearful times
 during the wars of york and lancaster
 that had befall'n us as we paced along
 upon the giddy footing of the hatches
 methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling
 struck me that thought to stay him overboard
 into the tumbling billows of the main
 lord lord methought what pain it was to drown
 what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears
 what ugly sights of death within mine eyes
 methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks
 ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon
 wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
 inestimable stones unvalued jewels
 all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea
 some lay in dead men's skulls and in those holes
 where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
 as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
 which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
 and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by
brakenbury had you such leisure in the time of death
 to gaze upon the secrets of the deep
clarence methought i had and often did i strive
 to yield the ghost but still the envious flood
 kept in my soul and would not let it forth
 to seek the empty vast and wandering air
 but smother'd it within my panting bulk
 which almost burst to belch it in the sea
brakenbury awaked you not with this sore agony
clarence o no my dream was lengthen'd after life
 o then began the tempest to my soul
 who pass'd methought the melancholy flood
 with that grim ferryman which poets write of
 unto the kingdom of perpetual night
 the first that there did greet my stranger soul
 was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick
 who cried aloud what scourge for perjury
 can this dark monarchy afford false clarence'
 and so he vanish'd then came wandering by
 a shadow like an angel with bright hair
 dabbled in blood and he squeak'd out aloud
 clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence
 that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury
 seize on him furies take him to your torments'
 with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
 environ'd me about and howled in mine ears
 such hideous cries that with the very noise
 i trembling waked and for a season after
 could not believe but that i was in hell
 such terrible impression made the dream
brakenbury no marvel my lord though it affrighted you
 i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it
clarence o brakenbury i have done those things
 which now bear evidence against my soul
 for edward's sake and see how he requites me
 o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
 but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds
 yet execute thy wrath in me alone
 o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
 i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me
 my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep
brakenbury i will my lord god give your grace good rest
 clarence sleeps
 sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
 makes the night morning and the noontide night
 princes have but their tides for their glories
 an outward honour for an inward toil
 and for unfelt imagination
 they often feel a world of restless cares
 so that betwixt their tides and low names
 there's nothing differs but the outward fame
 enter the two murderers
first murderer ho who's here
brakenbury in god's name what are you and how came you hither
first murderer i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs
brakenbury yea are you so brief
second murderer o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show
 him our commission talk no more
 brakenbury reads it
brakenbury i am in this commanded to deliver
 the noble duke of clarence to your hands
 i will not reason what is meant hereby
 because i will be guiltless of the meaning
 here are the keys there sits the duke asleep
 i'll to the king and signify to him
 that thus i have resign'd my charge to you
first murderer do so it is a point of wisdom fare you well
 exit brakenbury
second murderer what shall we stab him as he sleeps
first murderer no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes
second murderer when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till
 the judgmentday
first murderer why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping
second murderer the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind
 of remorse in me
first murderer what art thou afraid
second murderer not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be
 damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us
first murderer i thought thou hadst been resolute
second murderer so i am to let him live
first murderer back to the duke of gloucester tell him so
second murderer i pray thee stay a while i hope my holy humour
 will change twas wont to hold me but while one
 would tell twenty
first murderer how dost thou feel thyself now
second murderer faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet
 within me
first murderer remember our reward when the deed is done
second murderer zounds he dies i had forgot the reward
first murderer where is thy conscience now
second murderer in the duke of gloucester's purse
first murderer so when he opens his purse to give us our reward
 thy conscience flies out
second murderer let it go there's few or none will entertain it
first murderer how if it come to thee again
second murderer i'll not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it
 makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it
 accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him
 he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife but it
 detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
 mutinies in a man's bosom it fills one full of
 obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
 that i found it beggars any man that keeps it it
 is turned out of all towns and cities for a
 dangerous thing and every man that means to live
 well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
 without it
first murderer zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me
 not to kill the duke
second murderer take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not he
 would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh
first murderer tut i am strongframed he cannot prevail with me
 i warrant thee
second murderer spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
 reputation come shall we to this gear
first murderer take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
 sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt
 in the next room
second murderer o excellent devise make a sop of him
first murderer hark he stirs shall i strike
second murderer no first let's reason with him
clarence where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine
second murderer you shall have wine enough my lord anon
clarence in god's name what art thou
second murderer a man as you are
clarence but not as i am royal
second murderer nor you as we are loyal
clarence thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
second murderer my voice is now the king's my looks mine own
clarence how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
 your eyes do menace me why look you pale
 who sent you hither wherefore do you come
both to to to
clarence to murder me
both ay ay
clarence you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
 and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
 wherein my friends have i offended you
first murderer offended us you have not but the king
clarence i shall be reconciled to him again
second murderer never my lord therefore prepare to die
clarence are you call'd forth from out a world of men
 to slay the innocent what is my offence
 where are the evidence that do accuse me
 what lawful quest have given their verdict up
 unto the frowning judge or who pronounced
 the bitter sentence of poor clarence death
 before i be convict by course of law
 to threaten me with death is most unlawful
 i charge you as you hope to have redemption
 by christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins
 that you depart and lay no hands on me
 the deed you undertake is damnable
first murderer what we will do we do upon command
second murderer and he that hath commanded is the king
clarence erroneous vassal the great king of kings
 hath in the tables of his law commanded
 that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then
 spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's
 take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands
 to hurl upon their heads that break his law
second murderer and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
 for false forswearing and for murder too
 thou didst receive the holy sacrament
 to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster
first murderer and like a traitor to the name of god
 didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
 unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son
second murderer whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend
first murderer how canst thou urge god's dreadful law to us
 when thou hast broke it in so dear degree
clarence alas for whose sake did i that ill deed
 for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs
 he sends ye not to murder me for this
 for in this sin he is as deep as i
 if god will be revenged for this deed
 o know you yet he doth it publicly
 take not the quarrel from his powerful arm
 he needs no indirect nor lawless course
 to cut off those that have offended him
first murderer who made thee then a bloody minister
 when gallantspringing brave plantagenet
 that princely novice was struck dead by thee
clarence my brother's love the devil and my rage
first murderer thy brother's love our duty and thy fault
 provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
clarence oh if you love my brother hate not me
 i am his brother and i love him well
 if you be hired for meed go back again
 and i will send you to my brother gloucester
 who shall reward you better for my life
 than edward will for tidings of my death
second murderer you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you
clarence o no he loves me and he holds me dear
 go you to him from me
both ay so we will
clarence tell him when that our princely father york
 bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
 and charged us from his soul to love each other
 he little thought of this divided friendship
 bid gloucester think of this and he will weep
first murderer ay millstones as be lesson'd us to weep
clarence o do not slander him for he is kind
first murderer right
 as snow in harvest thou deceivest thyself
 tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee
clarence it cannot be for when i parted with him
 he hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs
 that he would labour my delivery
second murderer why so he doth now he delivers thee
 from this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven
first murderer make peace with god for you must die my lord
clarence hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul
 to counsel me to make my peace with god
 and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind
 that thou wilt war with god by murdering me
 ah sirs consider he that set you on
 to do this deed will hate you for the deed
second murderer what shall we do
clarence relent and save your souls
first murderer relent tis cowardly and womanish
clarence not to relent is beastly savage devilish
 which of you if you were a prince's son
 being pent from liberty as i am now
 if two such murderers as yourselves came to you
 would not entreat for life
 my friend i spy some pity in thy looks
 o if thine eye be not a flatterer

buckingham whenever buckingham doth turn his hate
 on you or yours
 to the queen
 but with all duteous love
 doth cherish you and yours god punish me
 with hate in those where i expect most love
 when i have most need to employ a friend
 and most assured that he is a friend
 deep hollow treacherous and full of guile
 be he unto me this do i beg of god
 when i am cold in zeal to yours
king edward iv a pleasing cordial princely buckingham
 is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
 there wanteth now our brother gloucester here
 to make the perfect period of this peace
buckingham and in good time here comes the noble duke
 enter gloucester
gloucester good morrow to my sovereign king and queen
 and princely peers a happy time of day
king edward iv happy indeed as we have spent the day
 brother we done deeds of charity
 made peace enmity fair love of hate
 between these swelling wrongincensed peers
gloucester a blessed labour my most sovereign liege
 amongst this princely heap if any here
 by false intelligence or wrong surmise
 hold me a foe
 if i unwittingly or in my rage
 have aught committed that is hardly borne
 by any in this presence i desire
 to reconcile me to his friendly peace
 tis death to me to be at enmity
 i hate it and desire all good men's love
 first madam i entreat true peace of you
 which i will purchase with my duteous service
 of you my noble cousin buckingham
 if ever any grudge were lodged between us
 of you lord rivers and lord grey of you
 that without desert have frown'd on me
 dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
 i do not know that englishman alive
 with whom my soul is any jot at odds
 more than the infant that is born tonight
 i thank my god for my humility
queen elizabeth a holy day shall this be kept hereafter
 i would to god all strifes were well compounded
 my sovereign liege i do beseech your majesty
 to take our brother clarence to your grace
gloucester why madam have i offer'd love for this
 to be so bouted in this royal presence
 who knows not that the noble duke is dead
 they all start
 you do him injury to scorn his corse
rivers who knows not he is dead who knows he is
queen elizabeth all seeing heaven what a world is this
buckingham look i so pale lord dorset as the rest
dorset ay my good lord and no one in this presence
 but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
king edward iv is clarence dead the order was reversed
gloucester but he poor soul by your first order died
 and that a winged mercury did bear
 some tardy cripple bore the countermand
 that came too lag to see him buried
 god grant that some less noble and less loyal
 nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood
 deserve not worse than wretched clarence did
 and yet go current from suspicion
 enter derby
dorset a boon my sovereign for my service done
king edward iv i pray thee peace my soul is full of sorrow
dorset i will not rise unless your highness grant
king edward iv then speak at once what is it thou demand'st
dorset the forfeit sovereign of my servant's life
 who slew today a righteous gentleman
 lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
king edward iv have a tongue to doom my brother's death
 and shall the same give pardon to a slave
 my brother slew no man his fault was thought
 and yet his punishment was cruel death
 who sued to me for him who in my rage
 kneel'd at my feet and bade me be advised
 who spake of brotherhood who spake of love
 who told me how the poor soul did forsake
 the mighty warwick and did fight for me
 who told me in the field by tewksbury
 when oxford had me down he rescued me
 and said dear brother live and be a king'
 who told me when we both lay in the field
 frozen almost to death how he did lap me
 even in his own garments and gave himself
 all thin and naked to the numb cold night
 all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
 sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you
 had so much grace to put it in my mind
 but when your carters or your waitingvassals
 have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
 the precious image of our dear redeemer
 you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
 and i unjustly too must grant it you
 but for my brother not a man would speak
 nor i ungracious speak unto myself
 for him poor soul the proudest of you all
 have been beholding to him in his life
 yet none of you would once plead for his life
 o god i fear thy justice will take hold
 on me and you and mine and yours for this
 come hastings help me to my closet
 oh poor clarence
 exeunt some with king edward iv and queen margaret
gloucester this is the fruit of rashness mark'd you not
 how that the guilty kindred of the queen
 look'd pale when they did hear of clarence death
 o they did urge it still unto the king
 god will revenge it but come let us in
 to comfort edward with our company
buckingham we wait upon your grace

act ii
scene ii the palace
 enter the duchess of york with the two children of clarence
boy tell me good grandam is our father dead
duchess of york no boy
boy why do you wring your hands and beat your breast
 and cry o clarence my unhappy son'
girl why do you look on us and shake your head
 and call us wretches orphans castaways
 if that our noble father be alive
duchess of york my pretty cousins you mistake me much
 i do lament the sickness of the king
 as loath to lose him not your father's death
 it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost
boy then grandam you conclude that he is dead
 the king my uncle is to blame for this
 god will revenge it whom i will importune
 with daily prayers all to that effect
girl and so will i
duchess of york peace children peace the king doth love you well
 incapable and shallow innocents
 you cannot guess who caused your father's death
boy grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester
 told me the king provoked by the queen
 devised impeachments to imprison him 
 and when my uncle told me so he wept
 and hugg'd me in his arm and kindly kiss'd my cheek
 bade me rely on him as on my father
 and he would love me dearly as his child
duchess of york oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes
 and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile
 he is my son yea and therein my shame
 yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
boy think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
duchess of york ay boy
boy i cannot think it hark what noise is this
 enter queen elizabeth with her hair about her
 ears rivers and dorset after her
queen elizabeth oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep
 to chide my fortune and torment myself
 i'll join with black despair against my soul
 and to myself become an enemy
duchess of york what means this scene of rude impatience
queen elizabeth to make an act of tragic violence
 edward my lord your son our king is dead
 why grow the branches now the root is wither'd
 why wither not the leaves the sap being gone
 if you will live lament if die be brief
 that our swiftwinged souls may catch the king's
 or like obedient subjects follow him
 to his new kingdom of perpetual rest
duchess of york ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow
 as i had title in thy noble husband
 i have bewept a worthy husband's death
 and lived by looking on his images
 but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
 are crack'd in pieces by malignant death
 and i for comfort have but one false glass
 which grieves me when i see my shame in him
 thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
 and hast the comfort of thy children left thee
 but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
 and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs
 edward and clarence o what cause have i
 thine being but a moiety of my grief
 to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries
boy good aunt you wept not for our father's death
 how can we aid you with our kindred tears
girl our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd
 your widowdolour likewise be unwept
queen elizabeth give me no help in lamentation
 i am not barren to bring forth complaints
 all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
 that i being govern'd by the watery moon
 may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
 oh for my husband for my dear lord edward
children oh for our father for our dear lord clarence
duchess of york alas for both both mine edward and clarence
queen elizabeth what stay had i but edward and he's gone
children what stay had we but clarence and he's gone
duchess of york what stays had i but they and they are gone
queen elizabeth was never widow had so dear a loss
children were never orphans had so dear a loss
duchess of york was never mother had so dear a loss
 alas i am the mother of these moans
 their woes are parcell'd mine are general
 she for an edward weeps and so do i
 i for a clarence weep so doth not she
 these babes for clarence weep and so do i
 i for an edward weep so do not they
 alas you three on me threefold distress'd
 pour all your tears i am your sorrow's nurse
 and i will pamper it with lamentations
dorset comfort dear mother god is much displeased
 that you take with unthankfulness his doing
 in common worldly things tis call'd ungrateful
 with dull unwilligness to repay a debt
 which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
 much more to be thus opposite with heaven
 for it requires the royal debt it lent you
rivers madam bethink you like a careful mother
 of the young prince your son send straight for him
 let him be crown'd in him your comfort lives
 drown desperate sorrow in dead edward's grave
 and plant your joys in living edward's throne
 enter gloucester buckingham derby hastings and ratcliff
gloucester madam have comfort all of us have cause
 to wail the dimming of our shining star
 but none can cure their harms by wailing them
 madam my mother i do cry you mercy
 i did not see your grace humbly on my knee
 i crave your blessing
duchess of york god bless thee and put meekness in thy mind
 love charity obedience and true duty
gloucester aside amen and make me die a good old man
 that is the buttend of a mother's blessing
 i marvel why her grace did leave it out
buckingham you cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers
 that bear this mutual heavy load of moan
 now cheer each other in each other's love
 though we have spent our harvest of this king
 we are to reap the harvest of his son
 the broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
 but lately splinter'd knit and join'd together
 must gently be preserved cherish'd and kept
 me seemeth good that with some little train
 forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
 hither to london to be crown'd our king
rivers why with some little train my lord of buckingham
buckingham marry my lord lest by a multitude
 the newheal'd wound of malice should break out
 which would be so much the more dangerous
 by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd
 where every horse bears his commanding rein
 and may direct his course as please himself
 as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
 in my opinion ought to be prevented
gloucester i hope the king made peace with all of us
 and the compact is firm and true in me
rivers and so in me and so i think in all
 yet since it is but green it should be put
 to no apparent likelihood of breach
 which haply by much company might be urged
 therefore i say with noble buckingham
 that it is meet so few should fetch the prince
hastings and so say i
gloucester then be it so and go we to determine
 who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow
 madam and you my mother will you go
 to give your censures in this weighty business
queen elizabeth 
 with all our harts
duchess of york 
 exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester
buckingham my lord whoever journeys to the prince
 for god's sake let not us two be behind
 for by the way i'll sort occasion
 as index to the story we late talk'd of
 to part the queen's proud kindred from the king
gloucester my other self my counsel's consistory
 my oracle my prophet my dear cousin
 i like a child will go by thy direction
 towards ludlow then for we'll not stay behind

act ii
scene iii london a street
 enter two citizens meeting
first citizen neighbour well met whither away so fast
second citizen i promise you i scarcely know myself
 hear you the news abroad
first citizen ay that the king is dead
second citizen bad news by'r lady seldom comes the better
 i fear i fear twill prove a troublous world
 enter another citizen
third citizen neighbours god speed
first citizen give you good morrow sir
third citizen doth this news hold of good king edward's death
second citizen ay sir it is too true god help the while
third citizen then masters look to see a troublous world
first citizen no no by god's good grace his son shall reign
third citizen woe to the land that's govern'd by a child
second citizen in him there is a hope of government
 that in his nonage council under him
 and in his full and ripen'd years himself
 no doubt shall then and till then govern well
first citizen so stood the state when henry the sixth
 was crown'd in paris but at nine months old
third citizen stood the state so no no good friends god wot
 for then this land was famously enrich'd
 with politic grave counsel then the king
 had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
first citizen why so hath this both by the father and mother
third citizen better it were they all came by the father
 or by the father there were none at all
 for emulation now who shall be nearest
 will touch us all too near if god prevent not
 o full of danger is the duke of gloucester
 and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud
 and were they to be ruled and not to rule
 this sickly land might solace as before
first citizen come come we fear the worst all shall be well
third citizen when clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks
 when great leaves fall the winter is at hand
 when the sun sets who doth not look for night
 untimely storms make men expect a dearth
 all may be well but if god sort it so
 tis more than we deserve or i expect
second citizen truly the souls of men are full of dread
 ye cannot reason almost with a man
 that looks not heavily and full of fear
third citizen before the times of change still is it so
 by a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
 ensuing dangers as by proof we see
 the waters swell before a boisterous storm
 but leave it all to god whither away
second citizen marry we were sent for to the justices
third citizen and so was i i'll bear you company

scene iv london the palace
 enter the archbishop of york young york queen
 elizabeth and the duchess of york
archbishop of york last night i hear they lay at northampton
 at stonystratford will they be tonight
 tomorrow or next day they will be here
duchess of york i long with all my heart to see the prince
 i hope he is much grown since last i saw him
queen elizabeth but i hear no they say my son of york
 hath almost overta'en him in his growth
york ay mother but i would not have it so
duchess of york why my young cousin it is good to grow
york grandam one night as we did sit at supper
 my uncle rivers talk'd how i did grow
 more than my brother ay quoth my uncle
 gloucester
 small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace'
 and since methinks i would not grow so fast
 because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste
duchess of york good faith good faith the saying did not hold
 in him that did object the same to thee
 he was the wretched'st thing when he was young
 so long agrowing and so leisurely
 that if this rule were true he should be gracious
archbishop of york why madam so no doubt he is
duchess of york i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
york now by my troth if i had been remember'd
 i could have given my uncle's grace a flout
 to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine
duchess of york how my pretty york i pray thee let me hear it
york marry they say my uncle grew so fast
 that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
 twas full two years ere i could get a tooth
 grandam this would have been a biting jest
duchess of york i pray thee pretty york who told thee this
york grandam his nurse
duchess of york his nurse why she was dead ere thou wert born
york if twere not she i cannot tell who told me
queen elizabeth a parlous boy go to you are too shrewd
archbishop of york good madam be not angry with the child

duchess of york who hath committed them
messenger the mighty dukes
 gloucester and buckingham
queen elizabeth for what offence
messenger the sum of all i can i have disclosed
 why or for what these nobles were committed
 is all unknown to me my gracious lady
queen elizabeth ay me i see the downfall of our house
 the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind
 insulting tyranny begins to jet
 upon the innocent and aweless throne
 welcome destruction death and massacre
 i see as in a map the end of all
duchess of york accursed and unquiet wrangling days
 how many of you have mine eyes beheld
 my husband lost his life to get the crown
 and often up and down my sons were toss'd
 for me to joy and weep their gain and loss
 and being seated and domestic broils
 clean overblown themselves the conquerors
 make war upon themselves blood against blood
 self against self o preposterous
 and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
 or let me die to look on death no more
queen elizabeth come come my boy we will to sanctuary
 madam farewell
duchess of york i'll go along with you
queen elizabeth you have no cause
archbishop of york my gracious lady go
 and thither bear your treasure and your goods
 for my part i'll resign unto your grace
 the seal i keep and so betide to me
 as well i tender you and all of yours
 come i'll conduct you to the sanctuary

act iii
scene i london a street
 the trumpets sound enter the young prince edward
 gloucester buckingham cardinal catesby and others
buckingham welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber
gloucester welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign
 the weary way hath made you melancholy
prince edward no uncle but our crosses on the way
 have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
 i want more uncles here to welcome me
gloucester sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years
 hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
 nor more can you distinguish of a man
 than of his outward show which god he knows
 seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
 those uncles which you want were dangerous
 your grace attended to their sugar'd words
 but look'd not on the poison of their hearts 
 god keep you from them and from such false friends
prince edward god keep me from false friends but they were none
gloucester my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you
 enter the lord mayor and his train
lord mayor god bless your grace with health and happy days
prince edward i thank you good my lord and thank you all
 i thought my mother and my brother york
 would long ere this have met us on the way
 fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not
 to tell us whether they will come or no
 enter hastings
buckingham and in good time here comes the sweating lord
prince edward welcome my lord what will our mother come
hastings on what occasion god he knows not i
 the queen your mother and your brother york
 have taken sanctuary the tender prince
 would fain have come with me to meet your grace
 but by his mother was perforce withheld
buckingham fie what an indirect and peevish course
 is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace
 persuade the queen to send the duke of york
 unto his princely brother presently
 if she deny lord hastings go with him
 and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
cardinal my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory
 can from his mother win the duke of york
 anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
 to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid
 we should infringe the holy privilege
 of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
 would i be guilty of so deep a sin
buckingham you are too senselessobstinate my lord
 too ceremonious and traditional
 weigh it but with the grossness of this age
 you break not sanctuary in seizing him
 the benefit thereof is always granted
 to those whose dealings have deserved the place
 and those who have the wit to claim the place
 this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it
 and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
 then taking him from thence that is not there
 you break no privilege nor charter there
 oft have i heard of sanctuary men
 but sanctuary children ne'er till now
cardinal my lord you shall o'errule my mind for once
 come on lord hastings will you go with me
hastings i go my lord
prince edward good lords make all the speedy haste you may
 exeunt cardinal and hastings
 say uncle gloucester if our brother come
 where shall we sojourn till our coronation
gloucester where it seems best unto your royal self
 if i may counsel you some day or two
 your highness shall repose you at the tower
 then where you please and shall be thought most fit
 for your best health and recreation
prince edward i do not like the tower of any place
 did julius caesar build that place my lord
buckingham he did my gracious lord begin that place
 which since succeeding ages have reedified
prince edward is it upon record or else reported
 successively from age to age he built it
buckingham upon record my gracious lord
prince edward but say my lord it were not register'd
 methinks the truth should live from age to age
 as twere retail'd to all posterity
 even to the general allending day
gloucester aside so wise so young they say do never
 live long
prince edward what say you uncle
gloucester i say without characters fame lives long
 aside
 thus like the formal vice iniquity
 i moralize two meanings in one word
prince edward that julius caesar was a famous man
 with what his valour did enrich his wit
 his wit set down to make his valour live
 death makes no conquest of this conqueror
 for now he lives in fame though not in life
 i'll tell you what my cousin buckingham
buckingham what my gracious lord
prince edward an if i live until i be a man
 i'll win our ancient right in france again
 or die a soldier as i lived a king
gloucester aside short summers lightly have a forward spring
 enter young york hastings and the cardinal
buckingham now in good time here comes the duke of york
prince edward richard of york how fares our loving brother
york well my dread lord so must i call you now
prince edward ay brother to our grief as it is yours
 too late he died that might have kept that title
 which by his death hath lost much majesty
gloucester how fares our cousin noble lord of york
york i thank you gentle uncle o my lord
 you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
 the prince my brother hath outgrown me far
gloucester he hath my lord
york and therefore is he idle
gloucester o my fair cousin i must not say so
york then is he more beholding to you than i
gloucester he may command me as my sovereign
 but you have power in me as in a kinsman
york i pray you uncle give me this dagger
gloucester my dagger little cousin with all my heart
prince edward a beggar brother
york of my kind uncle that i know will give
 and being but a toy which is no grief to give
gloucester a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin
york a greater gift o that's the sword to it
gloucester a gentle cousin were it light enough
york o then i see you will part but with light gifts
 in weightier things you'll say a beggar nay
gloucester it is too heavy for your grace to wear
york i weigh it lightly were it heavier
gloucester what would you have my weapon little lord
york i would that i might thank you as you call me
gloucester how
york little
prince edward my lord of york will still be cross in talk
 uncle your grace knows how to bear with him
york you mean to bear me not to bear with me
 uncle my brother mocks both you and me
 because that i am little like an ape
 he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
buckingham with what a sharpprovided wit he reasons
 to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
 he prettily and aptly taunts himself
 so cunning and so young is wonderful
gloucester my lord will't please you pass along
 myself and my good cousin buckingham
 will to your mother to entreat of her
 to meet you at the tower and welcome you
york what will you go unto the tower my lord
prince edward my lord protector needs will have it so
york i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower
gloucester why what should you fear
york marry my uncle clarence angry ghost
 my grandam told me he was murdered there
prince edward i fear no uncles dead
gloucester nor none that live i hope
prince edward an if they live i hope i need not fear
 but come my lord and with a heavy heart
 thinking on them go i unto the tower
 a sennet exeunt all but gloucester buckingham
 and catesby
buckingham think you my lord this little prating york
 was not incensed by his subtle mother
 to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
gloucester no doubt no doubt o tis a parlous boy
 bold quick ingenious forward capable
 he is all the mother's from the top to toe
buckingham well let them rest come hither catesby
 thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
 as closely to conceal what we impart
 thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way
 what think'st thou is it not an easy matter
 to make william lord hastings of our mind
 for the instalment of this noble duke
 in the seat royal of this famous isle
catesby he for his father's sake so loves the prince
 that he will not be won to aught against him
buckingham what think'st thou then of stanley what will he
catesby he will do all in all as hastings doth
buckingham well then no more but this go gentle catesby
 and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings
 how doth he stand affected to our purpose
 and summon him tomorrow to the tower
 to sit about the coronation
 if thou dost find him tractable to us
 encourage him and show him all our reasons
 if he be leaden icycold unwilling
 be thou so too and so break off your talk
 and give us notice of his inclination
 for we tomorrow hold divided councils
 wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd
gloucester commend me to lord william tell him catesby
 his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
 tomorrow are let blood at pomfretcastle
 and bid my friend for joy of this good news
 give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more
buckingham good catesby go effect this business soundly
catesby my good lords both with all the heed i may
gloucester shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep
catesby you shall my lord
gloucester at crosby place there shall you find us both
 exit catesby
buckingham now my lord what shall we do if we perceive
 lord hastings will not yield to our complots
gloucester chop off his head man somewhat we will do
 and look when i am king claim thou of me
 the earldom of hereford and the moveables
 whereof the king my brother stood possess'd
buckingham i'll claim that promise at your grace's hands
gloucester and look to have it yielded with all willingness
 come let us sup betimes that afterwards
 we may digest our complots in some form

act iii
scene ii before lord hastings house
 enter a messenger
messenger what ho my lord
hastings within who knocks at the door
messenger a messenger from the lord stanley
 enter hastings
hastings what is't o'clock
messenger upon the stroke of four
hastings cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights
messenger so it should seem by that i have to say
 first he commends him to your noble lordship
hastings and then
messenger and then he sends you word
 he dreamt tonight the boar had razed his helm
 besides he says there are two councils held
 and that may be determined at the one
 which may make you and him to rue at the other
 therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure
 if presently you will take horse with him
 and with all speed post with him toward the north
 to shun the danger that his soul divines
hastings go fellow go return unto thy lord
 bid him not fear the separated councils
 his honour and myself are at the one
 and at the other is my servant catesby
 where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
 whereof i shall not have intelligence
 tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance
 and for his dreams i wonder he is so fond
 to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
 to fly the boar before the boar pursues
 were to incense the boar to follow us
 and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
 go bid thy master rise and come to me
 and we will both together to the tower
 where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
messenger my gracious lord i'll tell him what you say
 exit
 enter catesby
catesby many good morrows to my noble lord
hastings good morrow catesby you are early stirring
 what news what news in this our tottering state
catesby it is a reeling world indeed my lord
 and i believe twill never stand upright
 tim richard wear the garland of the realm
hastings how wear the garland dost thou mean the crown
catesby ay my good lord
hastings i'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
 ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced
 but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
catesby ay on my life and hopes to find forward
 upon his party for the gain thereof
 and thereupon he sends you this good news
 that this same very day your enemies
 the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret
hastings indeed i am no mourner for that news
 because they have been still mine enemies
 but that i'll give my voice on richard's side
 to bar my master's heirs in true descent
 god knows i will not do it to the death
catesby god keep your lordship in that gracious mind
hastings but i shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence
 that they who brought me in my master's hate
 i live to look upon their tragedy

catesby what my lord
hastings ere a fortnight make me elder

catesby tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
 when men are unprepared and look not for it

 with rivers vaughan grey and so twill do
 with some men else who think themselves as safe
 as thou and i who as thou know'st are dear
 to princely richard and to buckingham
catesby the princes both make high account of you

buckingham are all things fitting for that royal time
derby it is and wants but nomination
bishop of ely tomorrow then i judge a happy day
buckingham who knows the lord protector's mind herein
 who is most inward with the royal duke
bishop of ely your grace we think should soonest know his mind

 than i of yours
 nor i no more of his than you of mine
 lord hastings you and he are near in love
hastings i thank his grace i know he loves me well
 but for his purpose in the coronation
 i have not sounded him nor he deliver'd
 his gracious pleasure any way therein
 but you my noble lords may name the time

 which i presume he'll take in gentle part
 enter gloucester

 for i myself am not so well provided
 as else i would be were the day prolong'd
 reenter bishop of ely
bishop of ely where is my lord protector i have sent for these
 strawberries
hastings his grace looks cheerfully and smooth today
 there's some conceit or other likes him well
 when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit
 i think there's never a man in christendom
 that can less hide his love or hate than he
 for by his face straight shall you know his heart
derby what of his heart perceive you in his face
 by any likelihood he show'd today
hastings marry that with no man here he is offended
 for were he he had shown it in his looks
derby i pray god he be not i say
 reenter gloucester and buckingham
gloucester i pray you all tell me what they deserve
 that do conspire my death with devilish plots
 of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd
 upon my body with their hellish charms
hastings the tender love i bear your grace my lord
 makes me most forward in this noble presence
 to doom the offenders whatsoever they be
 i say my lord they have deserved death
gloucester then be your eyes the witness of this ill
 see how i am bewitch'd behold mine arm
 is like a blasted sapling wither'd up
 and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch
 consorted with that harlot strumpet shore
 that by their witchcraft thus have marked me
hastings if they have done this thing my gracious lord
gloucester if i thou protector of this damned strumpet
 tellest thou me of ifs thou art a traitor

 lovel and ratcliff look that it be done
 the rest that love me rise and follow me
 exeunt all but hastings ratcliff and lovel
hastings woe woe for england not a whit for me
 for i too fond might have prevented this
 stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm
 but i disdain'd it and did scorn to fly
 three times today my footcloth horse did stumble
 and startled when he look'd upon the tower
 as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse
 o now i want the priest that spake to me
 i now repent i told the pursuivant
 as twere triumphing at mine enemies
 how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd
 and i myself secure in grace and favour
 o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse
 is lighted on poor hastings wretched head
ratcliff dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner
 make a short shrift he longs to see your head
hastings o momentary grace of mortal men
 which we more hunt for than the grace of god
 who builds his hopes in air of your good looks
 lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
 ready with every nod to tumble down
 into the fatal bowels of the deep
lovel come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim
hastings o bloody richard miserable england
 i prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
 that ever wretched age hath look'd upon
 come lead me to the block bear him my head

scene v the towerwalls
 enter gloucester and buckingham in rotten armour
 marvellous illfavoured
gloucester come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour
 murder thy breath in the middle of a word
 and then begin again and stop again
 as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror
buckingham tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian
 speak and look back and pry on every side
 tremble and start at wagging of a straw
 intending deep suspicion ghastly looks
 are at my service like enforced smiles
 and both are ready in their offices
 at any time to grace my stratagems
 but what is catesby gone
gloucester he is and see he brings the mayor along
 enter the lord mayor and catesby
buckingham lord mayor
gloucester look to the drawbridge there
buckingham hark a drum
gloucester catesby o'erlook the walls
buckingham lord mayor the reason we have sent
gloucester look back defend thee here are enemies
buckingham god and our innocency defend and guard us
gloucester be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel
 enter lovel and ratcliff with hastings head
lovel here is the head of that ignoble traitor
 the dangerous and unsuspected hastings
gloucester so dear i loved the man that i must weep
 i took him for the plainest harmless creature
 that breathed upon this earth a christian
 made him my book wherein my soul recorded
 the history of all her secret thoughts
 so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
 that his apparent open guilt omitted
 i mean his conversation with shore's wife
 he lived from all attainder of suspect
buckingham well well he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
 that ever lived
 would you imagine or almost believe
 were't not that by great preservation
 we live to tell it you the subtle traitor
 this day had plotted in the councilhouse
 to murder me and my good lord of gloucester
lord mayor what had he so
gloucester what think you we are turks or infidels
 or that we would against the form of law
 proceed thus rashly to the villain's death
 but that the extreme peril of the case
 the peace of england and our persons safety
 enforced us to this execution
lord mayor now fair befall you he deserved his death
 and you my good lords both have well proceeded
 to warn false traitors from the like attempts
 i never look'd for better at his hands
 after he once fell in with mistress shore
gloucester yet had not we determined he should die
 until your lordship came to see his death
 which now the loving haste of these our friends
 somewhat against our meaning have prevented
 because my lord we would have had you heard
 the traitor speak and timorously confess
 the manner and the purpose of his treason
 that you might well have signified the same
 unto the citizens who haply may
 misconstrue us in him and wail his death
lord mayor but my good lord your grace's word shall serve
 as well as i had seen and heard him speak
 and doubt you not right noble princes both
 but i'll acquaint our duteous citizens
 with all your just proceedings in this cause
gloucester and to that end we wish'd your lordship here
 to avoid the carping censures of the world
buckingham but since you come too late of our intents
 yet witness what you hear we did intend
 and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell
 exit lord mayor
gloucester go after after cousin buckingham
 the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post
 there at your meet'st advantage of the time
 infer the bastardy of edward's children
 tell them how edward put to death a citizen
 only for saying he would make his son
 heir to the crown meaning indeed his house
 which by the sign thereof was termed so
 moreover urge his hateful luxury
 and bestial appetite in change of lust
 which stretched to their servants daughters wives
 even where his lustful eye or savage heart
 without control listed to make his prey
 nay for a need thus far come near my person
 tell them when that my mother went with child
 of that unsatiate edward noble york
 my princely father then had wars in france
 and by just computation of the time
 found that the issue was not his begot
 which well appeared in his lineaments
 being nothing like the noble duke my father
 but touch this sparingly as twere far off
 because you know my lord my mother lives
buckingham fear not my lord i'll play the orator
 as if the golden fee for which i plead
 were for myself and so my lord adieu
gloucester if you thrive well bring them to baynard's castle
 where you shall find me well accompanied
 with reverend fathers and welllearned bishops
buckingham i go and towards three or four o'clock
 look for the news that the guildhall affords
 exit buckingham
gloucester go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw
 to catesby
 go thou to friar penker bid them both
 meet me within this hour at baynard's castle
 exeunt all but gloucester
 now will i in to take some privy order
 to draw the brats of clarence out of sight
 and to give notice that no manner of person
 at any time have recourse unto the princes

 enter a scrivener with a paper in his hand
scrivener this is the indictment of the good lord hastings
 which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
 that it may be this day read over in paul's
 and mark how well the sequel hangs together
 eleven hours i spent to write it over
 for yesternight by catesby was it brought me
 the precedent was full as long adoing
 and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings
 untainted unexamined free at liberty
 here's a good world the while why who's so gross
 that seeth not this palpable device
 yet who's so blind but says he sees it not
 bad is the world and all will come to nought
 when such bad dealings must be seen in thought
 exit

act iii
scene vii baynard's castle
 enter gloucester and buckingham at several doors
gloucester how now my lord what say the citizens
buckingham now by the holy mother of our lord
 the citizens are mum and speak not a word
gloucester touch'd you the bastardy of edward's children
buckingham i did with his contract with lady lucy
 and his contract by deputy in france
 the insatiate greediness of his desires
 and his enforcement of the city wives
 his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
 as being got your father then in france
 his resemblance being not like the duke
 withal i did infer your lineaments
 being the right idea of your father
 both in your form and nobleness of mind
 laid open all your victories in scotland
 your dicipline in war wisdom in peace
 your bounty virtue fair humility
 indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose
 untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse
 and when mine oratory grew to an end
 i bid them that did love their country's good
 cry god save richard england's royal king'
gloucester ah and did they so
buckingham no so god help me they spake not a word
 but like dumb statues or breathing stones
 gazed each on other and look'd deadly pale
 which when i saw i reprehended them
 and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence
 his answer was the people were not wont
 to be spoke to but by the recorder
 then he was urged to tell my tale again
 thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd'
 but nothing spake in warrant from himself
 when he had done some followers of mine own
 at the lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps
 and some ten voices cried god save king richard'
 and thus i took the vantage of those few
 thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i
 this general applause and loving shout
 argues your wisdoms and your love to richard'
 and even here brake off and came away
gloucester what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak
buckingham no by my troth my lord
gloucester will not the mayor then and his brethren come
buckingham the mayor is here at hand intend some fear
 be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
 and look you get a prayerbook in your hand
 and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord
 for on that ground i'll build a holy descant
 and be not easily won to our request
 play the maid's part still answer nay and take it
gloucester i go and if you plead as well for them
 as i can say nay to thee for myself
 no doubt well bring it to a happy issue
buckingham go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks
 exit gloucester
 enter the lord mayor and citizens
 welcome my lord i dance attendance here
 i think the duke will not be spoke withal
 enter catesby
 here comes his servant how now catesby
 what says he
catesby my lord he doth entreat your grace
 to visit him tomorrow or next day
 he is within with two right reverend fathers
 divinely bent to meditation
 and no worldly suit would he be moved
 to draw him from his holy exercise
buckingham return good catesby to thy lord again
 tell him myself the mayor and citizens
 in deep designs and matters of great moment
 no less importing than our general good
 are come to have some conference with his grace
catesby i'll tell him what you say my lord
 exit
buckingham ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward
 he is not lolling on a lewd daybed
 but on his knees at meditation
 not dallying with a brace of courtezans
 but meditating with two deep divines
 not sleeping to engross his idle body
 but praying to enrich his watchful soul
 happy were england would this gracious prince
 take on himself the sovereignty thereof
 but sure i fear we shall ne'er win him to it
lord mayor marry god forbid his grace should say us nay
buckingham i fear he will
 reenter catesby
 how now catesby what says your lord
catesby my lord
 he wonders to what end you have assembled
 such troops of citizens to speak with him
 his grace not being warn'd thereof before
 my lord he fears you mean no good to him
buckingham sorry i am my noble cousin should
 suspect me that i mean no good to him
 by heaven i come in perfect love to him
 and so once more return and tell his grace
 exit catesby
 when holy and devout religious men
 are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence
 so sweet is zealous contemplation
 enter gloucester aloft between two bishops
 catesby returns
lord mayor see where he stands between two clergymen
buckingham two props of virtue for a christian prince
 to stay him from the fall of vanity
 and see a book of prayer in his hand
 true ornaments to know a holy man
 famous plantagenet most gracious prince
 lend favourable ears to our request
 and pardon us the interruption
 of thy devotion and right christian zeal
gloucester my lord there needs no such apology
 i rather do beseech you pardon me
 who earnest in the service of my god
 neglect the visitation of my friends
 but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure
buckingham even that i hope which pleaseth god above
 and all good men of this ungovern'd isle
gloucester i do suspect i have done some offence
 that seems disgracious in the city's eyes
 and that you come to reprehend my ignorance
buckingham you have my lord would it might please your grace
 at our entreaties to amend that fault
gloucester else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
buckingham then know it is your fault that you resign
 the supreme seat the throne majestical
 the scepter'd office of your ancestors
 your state of fortune and your due of birth
 the lineal glory of your royal house
 to the corruption of a blemished stock
 whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
 which here we waken to our country's good
 this noble isle doth want her proper limbs
 her face defaced with scars of infamy
 her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
 and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
 of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion
 which to recure we heartily solicit
 your gracious self to take on you the charge
 and kingly government of this your land
 not as protector steward substitute
 or lowly factor for another's gain
 but as successively from blood to blood
 your right of birth your empery your own
 for this consorted with the citizens
 your very worshipful and loving friends
 and by their vehement instigation
 in this just suit come i to move your grace
gloucester i know not whether to depart in silence
 or bitterly to speak in your reproof
 best fitteth my degree or your condition
 if not to answer you might haply think
 tonguetied ambition not replying yielded
 to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
 which fondly you would here impose on me
 if to reprove you for this suit of yours
 so season'd with your faithful love to me
 then on the other side i cheque'd my friends
 therefore to speak and to avoid the first
 and then in speaking not to incur the last
 definitively thus i answer you
 your love deserves my thanks but my desert
 unmeritable shuns your high request
 first if all obstacles were cut away
 and that my path were even to the crown
 as my ripe revenue and due by birth
 yet so much is my poverty of spirit
 so mighty and so many my defects
 as i had rather hide me from my greatness
 being a bark to brook no mighty sea
 than in my greatness covet to be hid
 and in the vapour of my glory smother'd
 but god be thank'd there's no need of me
 and much i need to help you if need were
 the royal tree hath left us royal fruit
 which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time
 will well become the seat of majesty
 and make no doubt us happy by his reign
 on him i lay what you would lay on me
 the right and fortune of his happy stars
 which god defend that i should wring from him
buckingham my lord this argues conscience in your grace
 but the respects thereof are nice and trivial
 all circumstances well considered
 you say that edward is your brother's son
 so say we too but not by edward's wife
 for first he was contract to lady lucy
 your mother lives a witness to that vow
 and afterward by substitute betroth'd
 to bona sister to the king of france
 these both put by a poor petitioner
 a carecrazed mother of a many children
 a beautywaning and distressed widow
 even in the afternoon of her best days
 made prize and purchase of his lustful eye
 seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
 to base declension and loathed bigamy
 by her in his unlawful bed he got
 this edward whom our manners term the prince
 more bitterly could i expostulate
 save that for reverence to some alive
 i give a sparing limit to my tongue
 then good my lord take to your royal self
 this proffer'd benefit of dignity
 if non to bless us and the land withal
 yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
 from the corruption of abusing times
 unto a lineal truederived course
lord mayor do good my lord your citizens entreat you
buckingham refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love
catesby o make them joyful grant their lawful suit
gloucester alas why would you heap these cares on me
 i am unfit for state and majesty
 i do beseech you take it not amiss
 i cannot nor i will not yield to you
buckingham if you refuse itas in love and zeal
 loath to depose the child your brother's son
 as well we know your tenderness of heart
 and gentle kind effeminate remorse
 which we have noted in you to your kin
 and egally indeed to all estates
 yet whether you accept our suit or no
 your brother's son shall never reign our king
 but we will plant some other in the throne
 to the disgrace and downfall of your house
 and in this resolution here we leave you
 come citizens zounds i'll entreat no more
gloucester o do not swear my lord of buckingham
 exit buckingham with the citizens
catesby call them again my lord and accept their suit
another do good my lord lest all the land do rue it
gloucester would you enforce me to a world of care
 well call them again i am not made of stone
 but penetrable to your kind entreats
 albeit against my conscience and my soul
 reenter buckingham and the rest
 cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men
 since you will buckle fortune on my back
 to bear her burthen whether i will or no
 i must have patience to endure the load
 but if black scandal or foulfaced reproach
 attend the sequel of your imposition
 your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
 from all the impure blots and stains thereof
 for god he knows and you may partly see
 how far i am from the desire thereof
lord mayor god bless your grace we see it and will say it
gloucester in saying so you shall but say the truth
buckingham then i salute you with this kingly title
 long live richard england's royal king
lord mayor 
 amen
citizens 
buckingham tomorrow will it please you to be crown'd
gloucester even when you please since you will have it so
buckingham tomorrow then we will attend your grace
 and so most joyfully we take our leave
gloucester come let us to our holy task again
 farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends

 you shall have letters from me to my son

 which issued from my other angel husband
 and that dead saint which then i weeping follow'd
 o when i say i look'd on richard's face
 this was my wish be thou quoth i  accursed
 for making me so young so old a widow
 and when thou wed'st let sorrow haunt thy bed
 and be thy wifeif any be so mad
 as miserable by the life of thee
 as thou hast made me by my dear lord's death
 lo ere i can repeat this curse again
 even in so short a space my woman's heart
 grossly grew captive to his honey words
 and proved the subject of my own soul's curse
 which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest
 for never yet one hour in his bed
 have i enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep
 but have been waked by his timorous dreams
 besides he hates me for my father warwick
 and will no doubt shortly be rid of me
queen elizabeth poor heart adieu i pity thy complaining
lady anne no more than from my soul i mourn for yours
queen elizabeth farewell thou woful welcomer of glory
lady anne adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it
duchess of york to dorset
 go thou to richmond and good fortune guide thee
 to lady anne
 go thou to richard and good angels guard thee
 to queen elizabeth
 go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee
 i to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
 eighty odd years of sorrow have i seen
 and each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen
queen elizabeth stay yet look back with me unto the tower
 pity you ancient stones those tender babes
 whom envy hath immured within your walls
 rough cradle for such little pretty ones
 rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
 for tender princes use my babies well
 so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell

act iv
scene iii the same
 enter tyrrel
tyrrel the tyrannous and bloody deed is done
 the most arch of piteous massacre
 that ever yet this land was guilty of
 dighton and forrest whom i did suborn
 to do this ruthless piece of butchery
 although they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs
 melting with tenderness and kind compassion
 wept like two children in their deaths sad stories
 lo thus quoth dighton lay those tender babes'
 thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another
 within their innocent alabaster arms
 their lips were four red roses on a stalk
 which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other
 a book of prayers on their pillow lay
 which once quoth forrest almost changed my mind
 but o the devil'there the villain stopp'd
 whilst dighton thus told on we smothered
 the most replenished sweet work of nature
 that from the prime creation e'er she framed'
 thus both are gone with conscience and remorse
 they could not speak and so i left them both
 to bring this tidings to the bloody king
 and here he comes
 enter king richard iii
 all hail my sovereign liege
king richard iii kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news
tyrrel if to have done the thing you gave in charge
 beget your happiness be happy then
 for it is done my lord
king richard iii but didst thou see them dead
tyrrel i did my lord
king richard iii and buried gentle tyrrel
tyrrel the chaplain of the tower hath buried them

king richard iii come to me tyrrel soon at after supper
 and thou shalt tell the process of their death
 meantime but think how i may do thee good
 and be inheritor of thy desire
 farewell till soon
 exit tyrrel
 the son of clarence have i pent up close
 his daughter meanly have i match'd in marriage
 the sons of edward sleep in abraham's bosom

 and by that knot looks proudly o'er the crown
 to her i go a jolly thriving wooer

king richard iii ely with richmond troubles me more near
 than buckingham and his rashlevied army

 delay leads impotent and snailpaced beggary
 then fiery expedition be my wing

act iv
scene iv before the palace
 enter queen margaret
queen margaret so now prosperity begins to mellow
 and drop into the rotten mouth of death
 here in these confines slily have i lurk'd
 to watch the waning of mine adversaries
 a dire induction am i witness to
 and will to france hoping the consequence
 will prove as bitter black and tragical
 withdraw thee wretched margaret who comes here
 enter queen elizabeth and the duchess of york
queen elizabeth ah my young princes ah my tender babes
 my unblown flowers newappearing sweets
 if yet your gentle souls fly in the air
 and be not fix'd in doom perpetual
 hover about me with your airy wings
 and hear your mother's lamentation
queen margaret hover about her say that right for right
 hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night
duchess of york so many miseries have crazed my voice
 that my woewearied tongue is mute and dumb
 edward plantagenet why art thou dead
queen margaret plantagenet doth quit plantagenet
 edward for edward pays a dying debt
queen elizabeth wilt thou o god fly from such gentle lambs
 and throw them in the entrails of the wolf
 when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
queen margaret when holy harry died and my sweet son
duchess of york blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost
 woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurp'd
 brief abstract and record of tedious days
 rest thy unrest on england's lawful earth
 sitting down
 unlawfully made drunk with innocents blood
queen elizabeth o that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
 as thou canst yield a melancholy seat
 then would i hide my bones not rest them here
 o who hath any cause to mourn but i
 sitting down by her
queen margaret if ancient sorrow be most reverend
 give mine the benefit of seniory
 and let my woes frown on the upper hand
 if sorrow can admit society
 sitting down with them
 tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine
 i had an edward till a richard kill'd him
 i had a harry till a richard kill'd him
 thou hadst an edward till a richard kill'd him
 thou hadst a richard till a richard killed him
duchess of york i had a richard too and thou didst kill him
 i had a rutland too thou holp'st to kill him
queen margaret thou hadst a clarence too and richard kill'd him
 from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
 a hellhound that doth hunt us all to death
 that dog that had his teeth before his eyes
 to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
 that foul defacer of god's handiwork
 that excellent grand tyrant of the earth
 that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
 thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
 o upright just and truedisposing god
 how do i thank thee that this carnal cur
 preys on the issue of his mother's body
 and makes her pewfellow with others moan
duchess of york o harry's wife triumph not in my woes
 god witness with me i have wept for thine
queen margaret bear with me i am hungry for revenge
 and now i cloy me with beholding it
 thy edward he is dead that stabb'd my edward
 thy other edward dead to quit my edward
 young york he is but boot because both they
 match not the high perfection of my loss
 thy clarence he is dead that kill'd my edward
 and the beholders of this tragic play
 the adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey
 untimely smother'd in their dusky graves
 richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer
 only reserved their factor to buy souls
 and send them thither but at hand at hand
 ensues his piteous and unpitied end
 earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
 to have him suddenly convey'd away
 cancel his bond of life dear god i prey
 that i may live to say the dog is dead
queen elizabeth o thou didst prophesy the time would come
 that i should wish for thee to help me curse
 that bottled spider that foul bunchback'd toad
queen margaret i call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune
 i call'd thee then poor shadow painted queen
 the presentation of but what i was
 the flattering index of a direful pageant
 one heaved ahigh to be hurl'd down below
 a mother only mock'd with two sweet babes
 a dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble
 a sign of dignity a garish flag
 to be the aim of every dangerous shot
 a queen in jest only to fill the scene
 where is thy husband now where be thy brothers
 where are thy children wherein dost thou joy
 who sues to thee and cries god save the queen'
 where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee
 where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee
 decline all this and see what now thou art
 for happy wife a most distressed widow
 for joyful mother one that wails the name
 for queen a very caitiff crown'd with care
 for one being sued to one that humbly sues
 for one that scorn'd at me now scorn'd of me
 for one being fear'd of all now fearing one
 for one commanding all obey'd of none
 thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about
 and left thee but a very prey to time
 having no more but thought of what thou wert
 to torture thee the more being what thou art
 thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
 usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
 now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke
 from which even here i slip my weary neck
 and leave the burthen of it all on thee
 farewell york's wife and queen of sad mischance
 these english woes will make me smile in france
queen elizabeth o thou well skill'd in curses stay awhile
 and teach me how to curse mine enemies
queen margaret forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days
 compare dead happiness with living woe
 think that thy babes were fairer than they were
 and he that slew them fouler than he is
 bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse
 revolving this will teach thee how to curse
queen elizabeth my words are dull o quicken them with thine
queen margaret thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
 exit
duchess of york why should calamity be full of words
queen elizabeth windy attorneys to their client woes
 airy succeeders of intestate joys
 poor breathing orators of miseries
 let them have scope though what they do impart
 help not all yet do they ease the heart
duchess of york if so then be not tonguetied go with me
 and in the breath of bitter words let's smother
 my damned son which thy two sweet sons smother'd
 i hear his drum be copious in exclaims
 enter king richard iii marching with drums and trumpets
king richard iii who intercepts my expedition
duchess of york o she that might have intercepted thee
 by strangling thee in her accursed womb
 from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
queen elizabeth hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown
 where should be graven if that right were right
 the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown
 and the dire death of my two sons and brothers
 tell me thou villain slave where are my children
duchess of york thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence
 and little ned plantagenet his son
queen elizabeth where is kind hastings rivers vaughan grey
king richard iii a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums
 let not the heavens hear these telltale women
 rail on the lord's enointed strike i say
 flourish alarums
 either be patient and entreat me fair
 or with the clamorous report of war
 thus will i drown your exclamations
duchess of york art thou my son
king richard iii ay i thank god my father and yourself
duchess of york then patiently hear my impatience
king richard iii madam i have a touch of your condition
 which cannot brook the accent of reproof
duchess of york o let me speak
king richard iii do then but i'll not hear
duchess of york i will be mild and gentle in my speech
king richard iii and brief good mother for i am in haste
duchess of york art thou so hasty i have stay'd for thee
 god knows in anguish pain and agony
king richard iii and came i not at last to comfort you
duchess of york no by the holy rood thou know'st it well
 thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell
 a grievous burthen was thy birth to me
 tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
 thy schooldays frightful desperate wild and furious
 thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
 thy age confirm'd proud subdued bloody
 treacherous
 more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred
 what comfortable hour canst thou name
 that ever graced me in thy company
king richard iii faith none but humphrey hour that call'd
 your grace
 to breakfast once forth of my company
 if i be so disgracious in your sight
 let me march on and not offend your grace
 strike the drum
duchess of york i prithee hear me speak
king richard iii you speak too bitterly
duchess of york hear me a word
 for i shall never speak to thee again
king richard iii so
duchess of york either thou wilt die by god's just ordinance
 ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
 or i with grief and extreme age shall perish
 and never look upon thy face again
 therefore take with thee my most heavy curse
 which in the day of battle tire thee more
 than all the complete armour that thou wear'st
 my prayers on the adverse party fight
 and there the little souls of edward's children
 whisper the spirits of thine enemies
 and promise them success and victory
 bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
 shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
 exit
queen elizabeth though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse
 abides in me i say amen to all
king richard iii stay madam i must speak a word with you
queen elizabeth i have no more sons of the royal blood
 for thee to murder for my daughters richard
 they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
 and therefore level not to hit their lives
king richard iii you have a daughter call'd elizabeth
 virtuous and fair royal and gracious
queen elizabeth and must she die for this o let her live
 and i'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty
 slander myself as false to edward's bed
 throw over her the veil of infamy
 so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter
 i will confess she was not edward's daughter
king richard iii wrong not her birth she is of royal blood
queen elizabeth to save her life i'll say she is not so
king richard iii her life is only safest in her birth
queen elizabeth and only in that safety died her brothers
king richard iii lo at their births good stars were opposite
queen elizabeth no to their lives bad friends were contrary
king richard iii all unavoided is the doom of destiny
queen elizabeth true when avoided grace makes destiny
 my babes were destined to a fairer death
 if grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life
king richard iii you speak as if that i had slain my cousins
queen elizabeth cousins indeed and by their uncle cozen'd
 of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
 whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts
 thy head all indirectly gave direction
 no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
 till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart
 to revel in the entrails of my lambs
 but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame
 my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
 till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes
 and i in such a desperate bay of death
 like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
 rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
king richard iii madam so thrive i in my enterprise
 and dangerous success of bloody wars
 as i intend more good to you and yours
 than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd
queen elizabeth what good is cover'd with the face of heaven
 to be discover'd that can do me good
king richard iii the advancement of your children gentle lady
queen elizabeth up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
king richard iii no to the dignity and height of honour
 the high imperial type of this earth's glory
queen elizabeth flatter my sorrows with report of it
 tell me what state what dignity what honour
 canst thou demise to any child of mine
king richard iii even all i have yea and myself and all
 will i withal endow a child of thine
 so in the lethe of thy angry soul
 thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
 which thou supposest i have done to thee
queen elizabeth be brief lest that be process of thy kindness
 last longer telling than thy kindness date
king richard iii then know that from my soul i love thy daughter
queen elizabeth my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul
king richard iii what do you think
queen elizabeth that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
 so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers
 and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it
king richard iii be not so hasty to confound my meaning
 i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter
 and mean to make her queen of england
queen elizabeth say then who dost thou mean shall be her king
king richard iii even he that makes her queen who should be else
queen elizabeth what thou
king richard iii i even i what think you of it madam
queen elizabeth how canst thou woo her
king richard iii that would i learn of you
 as one that are best acquainted with her humour
queen elizabeth and wilt thou learn of me
king richard iii madam with all my heart
queen elizabeth send to her by the man that slew her brothers
 a pair of bleedinghearts thereon engrave
 edward and york then haply she will weep
 therefore present to heras sometime margaret
 did to thy father steep'd in rutland's blood
 a handkerchief which say to her did drain
 the purple sap from her sweet brother's body
 and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith
 if this inducement force her not to love
 send her a story of thy noble acts
 tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence
 her uncle rivers yea and for her sake
 madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
king richard iii come come you mock me this is not the way
 to win our daughter
queen elizabeth there is no other way
 unless thou couldst put on some other shape
 and not be richard that hath done all this
king richard iii say that i did all this for love of her
queen elizabeth nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee
 having bought love with such a bloody spoil
king richard iii look what is done cannot be now amended
 men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
 which after hours give leisure to repent
 if i did take the kingdom from your sons
 to make amends ill give it to your daughter
 if i have kill'd the issue of your womb
 to quicken your increase i will beget
 mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
 a grandam's name is little less in love
 than is the doting title of a mother
 they are as children but one step below
 even of your mettle of your very blood
 of an one pain save for a night of groans
 endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow
 your children were vexation to your youth
 but mine shall be a comfort to your age
 the loss you have is but a son being king
 and by that loss your daughter is made queen
 i cannot make you what amends i would
 therefore accept such kindness as i can
 dorset your son that with a fearful soul
 leads discontented steps in foreign soil
 this fair alliance quickly shall call home
 to high promotions and great dignity
 the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
 familiarly shall call thy dorset brother
 again shall you be mother to a king
 and all the ruins of distressful times
 repair'd with double riches of content
 what we have many goodly days to see
 the liquid drops of tears that you have shed
 shall come again transform'd to orient pearl
 advantaging their loan with interest
 of ten times double gain of happiness
 go then my mother to thy daughter go
 make bold her bashful years with your experience
 prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
 put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
 of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess
 with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
 and when this arm of mine hath chastised
 the petty rebel dullbrain'd buckingham
 bound with triumphant garlands will i come
 and lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed
 to whom i will retail my conquest won
 and she shall be sole victress caesar's caesar
queen elizabeth what were i best to say her father's brother
 would be her lord or shall i say her uncle
 or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
 under what title shall i woo for thee
 that god the law my honour and her love
 can make seem pleasing to her tender years
king richard iii infer fair england's peace by this alliance
queen elizabeth which she shall purchase with still lasting war
king richard iii say that the king which may command entreats
queen elizabeth that at her hands which the king's king forbids
king richard iii say she shall be a high and mighty queen
queen elizabeth to wail the tide as her mother doth
king richard iii say i will love her everlastingly
queen elizabeth but how long shall that title ever last
king richard iii sweetly in force unto her fair life's end
queen elizabeth but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last
king richard iii so long as heaven and nature lengthens it
queen elizabeth so long as hell and richard likes of it
king richard iii say i her sovereign am her subject love
queen elizabeth but she your subject loathes such sovereignty
king richard iii be eloquent in my behalf to her
queen elizabeth an honest tale speeds best being plainly told
king richard iii then in plain terms tell her my loving tale
queen elizabeth plain and not honest is too harsh a style
king richard iii your reasons are too shallow and too quick
queen elizabeth o no my reasons are too deep and dead
 too deep and dead poor infants in their grave
king richard iii harp not on that string madam that is past
queen elizabeth harp on it still shall i till heartstrings break
king richard iii now by my george my garter and my crown
queen elizabeth profaned dishonour'd and the third usurp'd
king richard iii i swear
queen elizabeth by nothing for this is no oath
 the george profaned hath lost his holy honour
 the garter blemish'd pawn'd his knightly virtue
 the crown usurp'd disgraced his kingly glory
 if something thou wilt swear to be believed
 swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd
king richard iii now by the world
queen elizabeth tis full of thy foul wrongs
king richard iii my father's death
queen elizabeth thy life hath that dishonour'd
king richard iii then by myself
queen elizabeth thyself thyself misusest
king richard iii why then by god
queen elizabeth god's wrong is most of all
 if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him
 the unity the king thy brother made
 had not been broken nor my brother slain
 if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him
 the imperial metal circling now thy brow
 had graced the tender temples of my child
 and both the princes had been breathing here
 which now two tender playfellows to dust
 thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms
 what canst thou swear by now
king richard iii the time to come
queen elizabeth that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast
 for i myself have many tears to wash
 hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee
 the children live whose parents thou hast
 slaughter'd
 ungovern'd youth to wail it in their age
 the parents live whose children thou hast butcher'd
 old wither'd plants to wail it with their age
 swear not by time to come for that thou hast
 misused ere used by time misused o'erpast
king richard iii as i intend to prosper and repent
 so thrive i in my dangerous attempt
 of hostile arms myself myself confound
 heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
 day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
 be opposite all planets of good luck
 to my proceedings if with pure heart's love
 immaculate devotion holy thoughts
 i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
 in her consists my happiness and thine
 without her follows to this land and me
 to thee herself and many a christian soul
 death desolation ruin and decay
 it cannot be avoided but by this
 it will not be avoided but by this
 therefore good motheri must can you so
 be the attorney of my love to her
 plead what i will be not what i have been
 not my deserts but what i will deserve
 urge the necessity and state of times
 and be not peevishfond in great designs
queen elizabeth shall i be tempted of the devil thus
king richard iii ay if the devil tempt thee to do good
queen elizabeth shall i forget myself to be myself
king richard iii ay if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself
queen elizabeth but thou didst kill my children
king richard iii but in your daughter's womb i bury them
 where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
 selves of themselves to your recomforture
queen elizabeth shall i go win my daughter to thy will
king richard iii and be a happy mother by the deed
queen elizabeth i go write to me very shortly
 and you shall understand from me her mind
king richard iii bear her my true love's kiss and so farewell

 near to the town of leicester as we learn
 from tamworth thither is but one day's march
 in god's name cheerly on courageous friends
 to reap the harvest of perpetual peace
 by this one bloody trial of sharp war
oxford every man's conscience is a thousand swords
 to fight against that bloody homicide
herbert i doubt not but his friends will fly to us

 which in his greatest need will shrink from him

 cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh
 what do i fear myself there's none else by
 richard loves richard that is i am i
 is there a murderer here no yes i am
 then fly what from myself great reason why
 lest i revenge what myself upon myself
 alack i love myself wherefore for any good
 that i myself have done unto myself
 o no alas i rather hate myself
 for hateful deeds committed by myself
 i am a villain yet i lie i am not
 fool of thyself speak well fool do not flatter
 my conscience hath a thousand several tongues
 and every tongue brings in a several tale
 and every tale condemns me for a villain
 perjury perjury in the high'st degree
 murder stem murder in the direst degree
 all several sins all used in each degree
 throng to the bar crying all guilty guilty
 i shall despair there is no creature loves me
 and if i die no soul shall pity me
 nay wherefore should they since that i myself
 find in myself no pity to myself
 methought the souls of all that i had murder'd
 came to my tent and every one did threat
 tomorrow's vengeance on the head of richard

lords good morrow richmond
richmond cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen
 that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here
lords how have you slept my lord
richmond the sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams
 that ever enter'd in a drowsy head
 have i since your departure had my lords
 methought their souls whose bodies richard murder'd
 came to my tent and cried on victory
 i promise you my soul is very jocund
 in the remembrance of so fair a dream
 how far into the morning is it lords
lords upon the stroke of four
richmond why then tis time to arm and give direction
 his oration to his soldiers
 more than i have said loving countrymen
 the leisure and enforcement of the time
 forbids to dwell upon yet remember this
 god and our good cause fight upon our side
 the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
 like highrear'd bulwarks stand before our faces
 richard except those whom we fight against
 had rather have us win than him they follow
 for what is he they follow truly gentlemen
 a bloody tyrant and a homicide
 one raised in blood and one in blood establish'd
 one that made means to come by what he hath
 and slaughter'd those that were the means to help him
 abase foul stone made precious by the foil
 of england's chair where he is falsely set
 one that hath ever been god's enemy
 then if you fight against god's enemy
 god will in justice ward you as his soldiers
 if you do sweat to put a tyrant down
 you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
 if you do fight against your country's foes
 your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire
 if you do fight in safeguard of your wives
 your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
 if you do free your children from the sword
 your children's children quit it in your age
 then in the name of god and all these rights
 advance your standards draw your willing swords
 for me the ransom of my bold attempt
 shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face
 but if i thrive the gain of my attempt
 the least of you shall share his part thereof
 sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully

 if not to heaven then hand in hand to hell
 his oration to his army
 what shall i say more than i have inferr'd
 remember whom you are to cope withal
 a sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways
 a scum of bretons and base lackey peasants
 whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth
 to desperate ventures and assured destruction
 you sleeping safe they bring to you unrest
 you having lands and blest with beauteous wives
 they would restrain the one distain the other
 and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
 long kept in bretagne at our mother's cost
 a milksop one that never in his life
 felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
 let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again
 lash hence these overweening rags of france
 these famish'd beggars weary of their lives
 who but for dreaming on this fond exploit
 for want of means poor rats had hang'd themselves
 if we be conquer'd let men conquer us
 and not these bastard bretons whom our fathers
 have in their own land beaten bobb'd and thump'd
 and in record left them the heirs of shame
 shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives
 ravish our daughters

 what traitor hears me and says not amen
 england hath long been mad and scarr'd herself
 the brother blindly shed the brother's blood
 the father rashly slaughter'd his own son
 the son compell'd been butcher to the sire
 all this divided york and lancaster
 divided in their dire division
 o now let richmond and elizabeth
 the true succeeders of each royal house
 by god's fair ordinance conjoin together
 and let their heirs god if thy will be so
 enrich the time to come with smoothfaced peace
 with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
 abate the edge of traitors gracious lord
 that would reduce these bloody days again
 and make poor england weep in streams of blood
 let them not live to taste this land's increase
 that would with treason wound this fair land's peace
 now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again
 that she may long live here god say amen
