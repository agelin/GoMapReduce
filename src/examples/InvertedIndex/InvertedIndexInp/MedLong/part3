 fell from their boughs and left me open bare
 for every storm that blows i to bear this
 that never knew but better is some burden
 thy nature did commence in sufferance time
 hath made thee hard in't why shouldst thou hate men
 they never flatter'd thee what hast thou given
 if thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag
 must be thy subject who in spite put stuff
 to some she beggar and compounded thee
 poor rogue hereditary hence be gone
 if thou hadst not been born the worst of men
 thou hadst been a knave and flatterer
apemantus art thou proud yet
timon ay that i am not thee
apemantus i that i was
 no prodigal
timon i that i am one now
 were all the wealth i have shut up in thee
 i'ld give thee leave to hang it get thee gone
 that the whole life of athens were in this
 thus would i eat it
 eating a root
apemantus here i will mend thy feast
 offering him a root
timon first mend my company take away thyself
apemantus so i shall mend mine own by the lack of thine
timon tis not well mended so it is but botch'd
 if not i would it were
apemantus what wouldst thou have to athens
timon thee thither in a whirlwind if thou wilt
 tell them there i have gold look so i have
apemantus here is no use for gold
timon the best and truest
 for here it sleeps and does no hired harm
apemantus where liest o nights timon
timon under that's above me
 where feed'st thou o days apemantus
apemantus where my stomach finds meat or rather where i eat
 it
timon would poison were obedient and knew my mind
apemantus where wouldst thou send it
timon to sauce thy dishes
apemantus the middle of humanity thou never knewest but the
 extremity of both ends when thou wast in thy gilt
 and thy perfume they mocked thee for too much
 curiosity in thy rags thou knowest none but art
 despised for the contrary there's a medlar for
 thee eat it
timon on what i hate i feed not
apemantus dost hate a medlar
timon ay though it look like thee
apemantus an thou hadst hated meddlers sooner thou shouldst
 have loved thyself better now what man didst thou
 ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means
timon who without those means thou talkest of didst thou
 ever know beloved
apemantus myself
timon i understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a
 dog
apemantus what things in the world canst thou nearest compare
 to thy flatterers
timon women nearest but men men are the things
 themselves what wouldst thou do with the world
 apemantus if it lay in thy power
apemantus give it the beasts to be rid of the men
timon wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
 men and remain a beast with the beasts
apemantus ay timon
timon a beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t'
 attain to if thou wert the lion the fox would
 beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would
 eat three if thou wert the fox the lion would
 suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by
 the ass if thou wert the ass thy dulness would
 torment thee and still thou livedst but as a
 breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy
 greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst
 hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the
 unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and
 make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert
 thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse
 wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the
 leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert german to
 the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
 thy life all thy safety were remotion and thy
 defence absence what beast couldst thou be that
 were not subject to a beast and what a beast art
 thou already that seest not thy loss in
 transformation
apemantus if thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou
 mightst have hit upon it here the commonwealth of
 athens is become a forest of beasts
timon how has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city
apemantus yonder comes a poet and a painter the plague of
 company light upon thee i will fear to catch it
 and give way when i know not what else to do i'll
 see thee again
timon when there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be
 welcome i had rather be a beggar's dog than apemantus
apemantus thou art the cap of all the fools alive
timon would thou wert clean enough to spit upon
apemantus a plague on thee thou art too bad to curse
timon all villains that do stand by thee are pure
apemantus there is no leprosy but what thou speak'st
timon if i name thee
 i'll beat thee but i should infect my hands
apemantus i would my tongue could rot them off
timon away thou issue of a mangy dog
 choler does kill me that thou art alive
 i swound to see thee
apemantus would thou wouldst burst
timon away
 thou tedious rogue i am sorry i shall lose
 a stone by thee
 throws a stone at him
apemantus beast
timon slave
apemantus toad
timon rogue rogue rogue
 i am sick of this false world and will love nought
 but even the mere necessities upon t
 then timon presently prepare thy grave
 lie where the light foam the sea may beat
 thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph
 that death in me at others lives may laugh
 to the gold
 o thou sweet kingkiller and dear divorce
 twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler
 of hymen's purest bed thou valiant mars
 thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer
 whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
 that lies on dian's lap thou visible god
 that solder'st close impossibilities
 and makest them kiss that speak'st with
 every tongue
 to every purpose o thou touch of hearts
 think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue
 set them into confounding odds that beasts
 may have the world in empire
apemantus would twere so
 but not till i am dead i'll say thou'st gold
 thou wilt be throng'd to shortly
timon throng'd to
apemantus ay
timon thy back i prithee
apemantus live and love thy misery
timon long live so and so die
 exit apemantus

 enter banditti
first bandit where should he have this gold it is some poor
 fragment some slender sort of his remainder the
 mere want of gold and the fallingfrom of his
 friends drove him into this melancholy
second bandit it is noised he hath a mass of treasure
third bandit let us make the assay upon him if he care not
 for't he will supply us easily if he covetously
 reserve it how shall's get it
second bandit true for he bears it not about him tis hid
first bandit is not this he
banditti where
second bandit tis his description
third bandit he i know him
banditti save thee timon
timon now thieves
banditti soldiers not thieves
timon both too and women's sons
banditti we are not thieves but men that much do want
timon your greatest want is you want much of meat
 why should you want behold the earth hath roots
 within this mile break forth a hundred springs
 the oaks bear mast the briers scarlet hips
 the bounteous housewife nature on each bush
 lays her full mess before you want why want
first bandit we cannot live on grass on berries water
 as beasts and birds and fishes
timon nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes
 you must eat men yet thanks i must you con
 that you are thieves profess'd that you work not
 in holier shapes for there is boundless theft
 in limited professions rascal thieves
 here's gold go suck the subtle blood o the grape
 till the high fever seethe your blood to froth
 and so scape hanging trust not the physician
 his antidotes are poison and he slays
 moe than you rob take wealth and lives together
 do villany do since you protest to do't
 like workmen i'll example you with thievery
 the sun's a thief and with his great attraction
 robs the vast sea the moon's an arrant thief
 and her pale fire she snatches from the sun
 the sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves
 the moon into salt tears the earth's a thief
 that feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
 from general excrement each thing's a thief
 the laws your curb and whip in their rough power
 have uncheque'd theft love not yourselves away
 rob one another there's more gold cut throats
 all that you meet are thieves to athens go
 break open shops nothing can you steal
 but thieves do lose it steal no less for this
 i give you and gold confound you howsoe'er amen
third bandit has almost charmed me from my profession by
 persuading me to it
first bandit tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
 us not to have us thrive in our mystery
second bandit i'll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade
first bandit let us first see peace in athens there is no time
 so miserable but a man may be true
 exeunt banditti
 enter flavius
flavius o you gods
 is yond despised and ruinous man my lord
 full of decay and failing o monument
 and wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd
 what an alteration of honour
 has desperate want made
 what viler thing upon the earth than friends
 who can bring noblest minds to basest ends
 how rarely does it meet with this time's guise
 when man was wish'd to love his enemies
 grant i may ever love and rather woo
 those that would mischief me than those that do
 has caught me in his eye i will present
 my honest grief unto him and as my lord
 still serve him with my life my dearest master
timon away what art thou
flavius have you forgot me sir
timon why dost ask that i have forgot all men
 then if thou grant'st thou'rt a man i have forgot thee
flavius an honest poor servant of yours
timon then i know thee not
 i never had honest man about me i all
 i kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains
flavius the gods are witness
 ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
 for his undone lord than mine eyes for you
timon what dost thou weep come nearer then i
 love thee
 because thou art a woman and disclaim'st
 flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
 but thorough lust and laughter pity's sleeping
 strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping
flavius i beg of you to know me good my lord
 to accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
 to entertain me as your steward still
timon had i a steward
 so true so just and now so comfortable
 it almost turns my dangerous nature mild
 let me behold thy face surely this man
 was born of woman
 forgive my general and exceptless rashness
 you perpetualsober gods i do proclaim
 one honest manmistake me notbut one
 no more i prayand he's a steward
 how fain would i have hated all mankind
 and thou redeem'st thyself but all save thee
 i fell with curses
 methinks thou art more honest now than wise
 for by oppressing and betraying me
 thou mightst have sooner got another service
 for many so arrive at second masters
 upon their first lord's neck but tell me true
 for i must ever doubt though ne'er so sure
 is not thy kindness subtle covetous
 if not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts
 expecting in return twenty for one
flavius no my most worthy master in whose breast
 doubt and suspect alas are placed too late
 you should have fear'd false times when you did feast
 suspect still comes where an estate is least
 that which i show heaven knows is merely love
 duty and zeal to your unmatched mind
 care of your food and living and believe it
 my most honour'd lord
 for any benefit that points to me
 either in hope or present i'ld exchange
 for this one wish that you had power and wealth
 to requite me by making rich yourself
timon look thee tis so thou singly honest man
 here take the gods out of my misery
 have sent thee treasure go live rich and happy
 but thus condition'd thou shalt build from men
 hate all curse all show charity to none
 but let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone
 ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs
 what thou deny'st to men let prisons swallow em
 debts wither em to nothing be men like
 blasted woods
 and may diseases lick up their false bloods
 and so farewell and thrive
flavius o let me stay
 and comfort you my master
timon if thou hatest curses
 stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free
 ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee
 exit flavius timon retires to his cave
 timon of athens
act v
scene i the woods before timon's cave
 enter poet and painter timon watching
 them from his cave
painter as i took note of the place it cannot be far where
 he abides
poet what's to be thought of him does the rumour hold
 for true that he's so full of gold
painter certain alcibiades reports it phrynia and
 timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor
 straggling soldiers with great quantity tis said
 he gave unto his steward a mighty sum
poet then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends
painter nothing else you shall see him a palm in athens
 again and flourish with the highest therefore
 tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this
 supposed distress of his it will show honestly in
 us and is very likely to load our purposes with
 what they travail for if it be a just true report
 that goes of his having
poet what have you now to present unto him
painter nothing at this time but my visitation only i will
 promise him an excellent piece
poet i must serve him so too tell him of an intent
 that's coming toward him
painter good as the best promising is the very air o the
 time it opens the eyes of expectation
 performance is ever the duller for his act and
 but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the
 deed of saying is quite out of use to promise is
 most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind
 of will or testament which argues a great sickness
 in his judgment that makes it
 timon comes from his cave behind
timon aside excellent workman thou canst not paint a
 man so bad as is thyself
poet i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for
 him it must be a personating of himself a satire
 against the softness of prosperity with a discovery
 of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency
timon aside must thou needs stand for a villain in
 thine own work wilt thou whip thine own faults in
 other men do so i have gold for thee
poet nay let's seek him
 then do we sin against our own estate
 when we may profit meet and come too late
painter true
 when the day serves before blackcorner'd night
 find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light come
timon aside i'll meet you at the turn what a
 god's gold
 that he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
 than where swine feed
 tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam
 settlest admired reverence in a slave
 to thee be worship and thy saints for aye
 be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey
 fit i meet them
 coming forward
poet hail worthy timon
painter our late noble master
timon have i once lived to see two honest men
poet sir
 having often of your open bounty tasted
 hearing you were retired your friends fall'n off
 whose thankless natureso abhorred spirits
 not all the whips of heaven are large enough
 what to you
 whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence
 to their whole being i am rapt and cannot cover
 the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
 with any size of words
timon let it go naked men may see't the better
 you that are honest by being what you are
 make them best seen and known
painter he and myself
 have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts
 and sweetly felt it
timon ay you are honest men
painter we are hither come to offer you our service
timon most honest men why how shall i requite you
 can you eat roots and drink cold water no
both what we can do we'll do to do you service
timon ye're honest men ye've heard that i have gold
 i am sure you have speak truth ye're honest men
painter so it is said my noble lord but therefore
 came not my friend nor i
timon good honest men thou draw'st a counterfeit
 best in all athens thou'rt indeed the best
 thou counterfeit'st most lively
painter so so my lord
timon e'en so sir as i say and for thy fiction
 why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
 that thou art even natural in thine art
 but for all this my honestnatured friends
 i must needs say you have a little fault
 marry tis not monstrous in you neither wish i
 you take much pains to mend
both beseech your honour
 to make it known to us
timon you'll take it ill
both most thankfully my lord
timon will you indeed
both doubt it not worthy lord
timon there's never a one of you but trusts a knave
 that mightily deceives you
both do we my lord
timon ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble
 know his gross patchery love him feed him
 keep in your bosom yet remain assured
 that he's a madeup villain
painter i know none such my lord
poet nor i
timon look you i love you well i'll give you gold
 rid me these villains from your companies
 hang them or stab them drown them in a draught
 confound them by some course and come to me
 i'll give you gold enough
both name them my lord let's know them
timon you that way and you this but two in company
 each man apart all single and alone
 yet an archvillain keeps him company
 if where thou art two villains shall not be
 come not near him if thou wouldst not reside
 but where one villain is then him abandon
 hence pack there's gold you came for gold ye slaves
 to painter
 you have work'd for me there's payment for you hence
 to poet
 you are an alchemist make gold of that
 out rascal dogs
 beats them out and then retires to his cave
 enter flavius and two senators
flavius it is in vain that you would speak with timon
 for he is set so only to himself
 that nothing but himself which looks like man
 is friendly with him
first senator bring us to his cave
 it is our part and promise to the athenians
 to speak with timon
second senator at all times alike
 men are not still the same twas time and griefs
 that framed him thus time with his fairer hand
 offering the fortunes of his former days
 the former man may make him bring us to him
 and chance it as it may
flavius here is his cave
 peace and content be here lord timon timon
 look out and speak to friends the athenians
 by two of their most reverend senate greet thee
 speak to them noble timon
 timon comes from his cave
timon thou sun that comfort'st burn speak and
 be hang'd
 for each true word a blister and each false
 be as cauterizing to the root o the tongue
 consuming it with speaking
first senator worthy timon
timon of none but such as you and you of timon
first senator the senators of athens greet thee timon
timon i thank them and would send them back the plague
 could i but catch it for them
first senator o forget
 what we are sorry for ourselves in thee
 the senators with one consent of love
 entreat thee back to athens who have thought
 on special dignities which vacant lie
 for thy best use and wearing
second senator they confess
 toward thee forgetfulness too general gross
 which now the public body which doth seldom
 play the recanter feeling in itself
 a lack of timon's aid hath sense withal
 of its own fail restraining aid to timon
 and send forth us to make their sorrow'd render
 together with a recompense more fruitful
 than their offence can weigh down by the dram
 ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
 as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
 and write in thee the figures of their love
 ever to read them thine
timon you witch me in it
 surprise me to the very brink of tears
 lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes
 and i'll beweep these comforts worthy senators
first senator therefore so please thee to return with us
 and of our athens thine and ours to take
 the captainship thou shalt be met with thanks
 allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
 live with authority so soon we shall drive back
 of alcibiades the approaches wild
 who like a boar too savage doth root up
 his country's peace
second senator and shakes his threatening sword
 against the walls of athens
first senator therefore timon
timon well sir i will therefore i will sir thus
 if alcibiades kill my countrymen
 let alcibiades know this of timon
 that timon cares not but if be sack fair athens
 and take our goodly aged men by the beards
 giving our holy virgins to the stain
 of contumelious beastly madbrain'd war
 then let him know and tell him timon speaks it
 in pity of our aged and our youth
 i cannot choose but tell him that i care not
 and let him take't at worst for their knives care not
 while you have throats to answer for myself
 there's not a whittle in the unruly camp
 but i do prize it at my love before
 the reverend'st throat in athens so i leave you
 to the protection of the prosperous gods
 as thieves to keepers
flavius stay not all's in vain
timon why i was writing of my epitaph
 it will be seen tomorrow my long sickness
 of health and living now begins to mend
 and nothing brings me all things go live still
 be alcibiades your plague you his
 and last so long enough
first senator we speak in vain
timon but yet i love my country and am not
 one that rejoices in the common wreck
 as common bruit doth put it
first senator that's well spoke
timon commend me to my loving countrymen
first senator these words become your lips as they pass
 thorough them
second senator and enter in our ears like great triumphers
 in their applauding gates
timon commend me to them
 and tell them that to ease them of their griefs
 their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses
 their pangs of love with other incident throes
 that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
 in life's uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them
 i'll teach them to prevent wild alcibiades wrath
first senator i like this well he will return again
timon i have a tree which grows here in my close
 that mine own use invites me to cut down
 and shortly must i fell it tell my friends
 tell athens in the sequence of degree
 from high to low throughout that whoso please
 to stop affliction let him take his haste
 come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe
 and hang himself i pray you do my greeting
flavius trouble him no further thus you still shall find him
timon come not to me again but say to athens
 timon hath made his everlasting mansion
 upon the beached verge of the salt flood
 who once a day with his embossed froth
 the turbulent surge shall cover thither come
 and let my gravestone be your oracle
 lips let sour words go by and language end
 what is amiss plague and infection mend
 graves only be men's works and death their gain
 sun hide thy beams timon hath done his reign
 retires to his cave
first senator his discontents are unremoveably
 coupled to nature
second senator our hope in him is dead let us return
 and strain what other means is left unto us
 in our dear peril
first senator it requires swift foot
 exeunt
 timon of athens
act v
scene ii before the walls of athens
 enter two senators and a messenger
first senator thou hast painfully discover'd are his files
 as full as thy report
messenger have spoke the least
 besides his expedition promises
 present approach
second senator we stand much hazard if they bring not timon
messenger i met a courier one mine ancient friend
 whom though in general part we were opposed
 yet our old love made a particular force
 and made us speak like friends this man was riding
 from alcibiades to timon's cave
 with letters of entreaty which imported
 his fellowship i the cause against your city
 in part for his sake moved
first senator here come our brothers
 enter the senators from timon
third senator no talk of timon nothing of him expect
 the enemies drum is heard and fearful scouring
 doth choke the air with dust in and prepare
 ours is the fall i fear our foes the snare

 enter a soldier seeking timon
soldier by all description this should be the place
 who's here speak ho no answer what is this
 timon is dead who hath outstretch'd his span
 some beast rear'd this there does not live a man
 dead sure and this his grave what's on this tomb
 i cannot read the character i'll take with wax
 our captain hath in every figure skill
 an aged interpreter though young in days

 exit
 timon of athens
act v
scene iv before the walls of athens
 trumpets sound enter alcibiades with his powers
alcibiades sound to this coward and lascivious town
 our terrible approach
 a parley sounded
 enter senators on the walls
 till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
 with all licentious measure making your wills
 the scope of justice till now myself and such
 as slept within the shadow of your power
 have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
 our sufferance vainly now the time is flush
 when crouching marrow in the bearer strong
 cries of itself no more now breathless wrong
 shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease
 and pursy insolence shall break his wind
 with fear and horrid flight
first senator noble and young
 when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit
 ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear
 we sent to thee to give thy rages balm
 to wipe out our ingratitude with loves
 above their quantity
second senator so did we woo
 transformed timon to our city's love
 by humble message and by promised means
 we were not all unkind nor all deserve
 the common stroke of war
first senator these walls of ours
 were not erected by their hands from whom
 you have received your griefs nor are they such
 that these great towers trophies and schools
 should fall
 for private faults in them
second senator nor are they living
 who were the motives that you first went out
 shame that they wanted cunning in excess
 hath broke their hearts march noble lord
 into our city with thy banners spread
 by decimation and a tithed death
 if thy revenges hunger for that food
 which nature loathestake thou the destined tenth
 and by the hazard of the spotted die
 let die the spotted
first senator all have not offended
 for those that were it is not square to take
 on those that are revenges crimes like lands
 are not inherited then dear countryman
 bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage
 spare thy athenian cradle and those kin
 which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
 with those that have offended like a shepherd
 approach the fold and cull the infected forth
 but kill not all together
second senator what thou wilt
 thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
 than hew to't with thy sword
first senator set but thy foot
 against our rampired gates and they shall ope
 so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
 to say thou'lt enter friendly
second senator throw thy glove
 or any token of thine honour else
 that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
 and not as our confusion all thy powers
 shall make their harbour in our town till we
 have seal'd thy full desire
alcibiades then there's my glove
 descend and open your uncharged ports
 those enemies of timon's and mine own
 whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
 fall and no more and to atone your fears
 with my more noble meaning not a man
 shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
 of regular justice in your city's bounds
 but shall be render'd to your public laws
 at heaviest answer
both tis most nobly spoken
alcibiades descend and keep your words
 the senators descend and open the gates
 enter soldier
soldier my noble general timon is dead
 entomb'd upon the very hem o the sea
 and on his gravestone this insculpture which
 with wax i brought away whose soft impression
 interprets for my poor ignorance
alcibiades reads the epitaph here lies a
 wretched corse of wretched soul bereft
 seek not my name a plague consume you wicked
 caitiffs left
 here lie i timon who alive all living men did hate
 pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay
 not here thy gait'
 these well express in thee thy latter spirits
 though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs
 scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
 droplets which
 from niggard nature fall yet rich conceit
 taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye
 on thy low grave on faults forgiven dead
 is noble timon of whose memory
 hereafter more bring me into your city
 and i will use the olive with my sword
 make war breed peace make peace stint war make each
 prescribe to other as each other's leech

 plead your deserts in peace and humbleness
saturninus how fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts
bassianus marcus andronicus so i do ally
 in thy uprightness and integrity
 and so i love and honour thee and thine
 thy noble brother titus and his sons
 and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all
 gracious lavinia rome's rich ornament
 that i will here dismiss my loving friends
 and to my fortunes and the people's favor
 commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd
 exeunt the followers of bassianus
saturninus friends that have been thus forward in my right
 i thank you all and here dismiss you all
 and to the love and favor of my country
 commit myself my person and the cause
 exeunt the followers of saturninus
 rome be as just and gracious unto me
 as i am confident and kind to thee
 open the gates and let me in
bassianus tribunes and me a poor competitor
 flourish saturninus and bassianus go up into the capitol
 enter a captain
captain romans make way the good andronicus
 patron of virtue rome's best champion
 successful in the battles that he fights
 with honour and with fortune is return'd
 from where he circumscribed with his sword
 and brought to yoke the enemies of rome
 drums and trumpets sounded enter martius and
 mutius after them two men bearing a coffin
 covered with black then lucius and quintus after
 them titus andronicus and then tamora with
 alarbus demetrius chiron aaron and other goths
 prisoners soldiers and people following the
 bearers set down the coffin and titus speaks
titus andronicus hail rome victorious in thy mourning weeds
 lo as the bark that hath discharged her fraught
 returns with precious jading to the bay
 from whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage
 cometh andronicus bound with laurel boughs
 to resalute his country with his tears
 tears of true joy for his return to rome
 thou great defender of this capitol
 stand gracious to the rites that we intend
 romans of five and twenty valiant sons
 half of the number that king priam had
 behold the poor remains alive and dead
 these that survive let rome reward with love
 these that i bring unto their latest home
 with burial amongst their ancestors
 here goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword
 titus unkind and careless of thine own
 why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet
 to hover on the dreadful shore of styx
 make way to lay them by their brethren
 the tomb is opened
 there greet in silence as the dead are wont
 and sleep in peace slain in your country's wars
 o sacred receptacle of my joys
 sweet cell of virtue and nobility
 how many sons of mine hast thou in store
 that thou wilt never render to me more
lucius give us the proudest prisoner of the goths
 that we may hew his limbs and on a pile
 ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
 before this earthy prison of their bones
 that so the shadows be not unappeased
 nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth
titus andronicus i give him you the noblest that survives
 the eldest son of this distressed queen
tamora stay roman brethren gracious conqueror
 victorious titus rue the tears i shed
 a mother's tears in passion for her son
 and if thy sons were ever dear to thee
 o think my son to be as dear to me
 sufficeth not that we are brought to rome
 to beautify thy triumphs and return
 captive to thee and to thy roman yoke
 but must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets
 for valiant doings in their country's cause
 o if to fight for king and commonweal
 were piety in thine it is in these
 andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood
 wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods
 draw near them then in being merciful
 sweet mercy is nobility's true badge
 thrice noble titus spare my firstborn son
titus andronicus patient yourself madam and pardon me
 these are their brethren whom you goths beheld
 alive and dead and for their brethren slain
 religiously they ask a sacrifice
 to this your son is mark'd and die he must
 to appease their groaning shadows that are gone
lucius away with him and make a fire straight
 and with our swords upon a pile of wood
 let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed
 exeunt lucius quintus martius and mutius with alarbus
tamora o cruel irreligious piety
chiron was ever scythia half so barbarous
demetrius oppose not scythia to ambitious rome
 alarbus goes to rest and we survive
 to tremble under titus threatening looks
 then madam stand resolved but hope withal
 the selfsame gods that arm'd the queen of troy
 with opportunity of sharp revenge
 upon the thracian tyrant in his tent
 may favor tamora the queen of goths
 when goths were goths and tamora was queen
 to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes
 reenter lucius quintus martius and mutius with
 their swords bloody
lucius see lord and father how we have perform'd
 our roman rites alarbus limbs are lopp'd
 and entrails feed the sacrificing fire
 whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky
 remaineth nought but to inter our brethren
 and with loud larums welcome them to rome
titus andronicus let it be so and let andronicus
 make this his latest farewell to their souls
 trumpets sounded and the coffin laid in the tomb
 in peace and honour rest you here my sons
 rome's readiest champions repose you here in rest
 secure from worldly chances and mishaps
 here lurks no treason here no envy swells
 here grow no damned grudges here are no storms
 no noise but silence and eternal sleep
 in peace and honour rest you here my sons
 enter lavinia
lavinia in peace and honour live lord titus long
 my noble lord and father live in fame
 lo at this tomb my tributary tears
 i render for my brethren's obsequies
 and at thy feet i kneel with tears of joy
 shed on the earth for thy return to rome
 o bless me here with thy victorious hand

 and led my country's strength successfully

titus andronicus tribunes i thank you and this suit i make
 that you create your emperor's eldest son
 lord saturnine whose virtues will i hope

 that word
quintus he that would vouch it in any place but here
titus andronicus what would you bury him in my despite
marcus andronicus no noble titus but entreat of thee
 to pardon mutius and to bury him
titus andronicus marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest
 and with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded
 my foes i do repute you every one

 answer i must and shall do with my life
 only thus much i give your grace to know
 by all the duties that i owe to rome
 this noble gentleman lord titus here

 be won at last
 dissemble all your griefs and discontents
 you are but newly planted in your throne
 lest then the people and patricians too
 upon a just survey take titus part
 and so supplant you for ingratitude
 which rome reputes to be a heinous sin
 yield at entreats and then let me alone
 i'll find a day to massacre them all
 and raze their faction and their family
 the cruel father and his traitorous sons
 to whom i sued for my dear son's life
 and make them know what tis to let a queen
 kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain
 aloud
 come come sweet emperor come andronicus
 take up this good old man and cheer the heart
 that dies in tempest of thy angry frown
saturninus rise titus rise my empress hath prevail'd

scene i rome before the palace
 enter aaron
aaron now climbeth tamora olympus top
 safe out of fortune's shot and sits aloft
 secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash
 advanced above pale envy's threatening reach
 as when the golden sun salutes the morn
 and having gilt the ocean with his beams
 gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach
 and overlooks the highestpeering hills
 so tamora
 upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
 and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown
 then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
 to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress
 and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
 hast prisoner held fetter'd in amorous chains
 and faster bound to aaron's charming eyes
 than is prometheus tied to caucasus
 away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts
 i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold
 to wait upon this newmade empress
 to wait said i to wanton with this queen
 this goddess this semiramis this nymph
 this siren that will charm rome's saturnine
 and see his shipwreck and his commonweal's
 holloa what storm is this
 enter demetrius and chiron braving
demetrius chiron thy years want wit thy wit wants edge
 and manners to intrude where i am graced
 and may for aught thou know'st affected be
chiron demetrius thou dost overween in all
 and so in this to bear me down with braves
 tis not the difference of a year or two
 makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate
 i am as able and as fit as thou
 to serve and to deserve my mistress grace
 and that my sword upon thee shall approve
 and plead my passions for lavinia's love
aaron aside clubs clubs these lovers will not keep
 the peace
demetrius why boy although our mother unadvised
 gave you a dancingrapier by your side
 are you so desperate grown to threat your friends
 go to have your lath glued within your sheath
 till you know better how to handle it
chiron meanwhile sir with the little skill i have
 full well shalt thou perceive how much i dare
demetrius ay boy grow ye so brave
 they draw
aaron coming forward why how now lords
 so near the emperor's palace dare you draw
 and maintain such a quarrel openly
 full well i wot the ground of all this grudge
 i would not for a million of gold
 the cause were known to them it most concerns
 nor would your noble mother for much more
 be so dishonour'd in the court of rome
 for shame put up
demetrius not i till i have sheathed
 my rapier in his bosom and withal
 thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
 that he hath breathed in my dishonour here
chiron for that i am prepared and full resolved
 foulspoken coward that thunder'st with thy tongue
 and with thy weapon nothing darest perform
aaron away i say
 now by the gods that warlike goths adore
 this petty brabble will undo us all
 why lords and think you not how dangerous
 it is to jet upon a prince's right
 what is lavinia then become so loose
 or bassianus so degenerate
 that for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
 without controlment justice or revenge
 young lords beware and should the empress know
 this discord's ground the music would not please
chiron i care not i knew she and all the world
 i love lavinia more than all the world
demetrius youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice
 lavinia is thine elder brother's hope
aaron why are ye mad or know ye not in rome
 how furious and impatient they be
 and cannot brook competitors in love
 i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths
 by this device
chiron aaron a thousand deaths
 would i propose to achieve her whom i love
aaron to achieve her how
demetrius why makest thou it so strange
 she is a woman therefore may be woo'd
 she is a woman therefore may be won
 she is lavinia therefore must be loved
 what man more water glideth by the mill
 than wots the miller of and easy it is
 of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know
 though bassianus be the emperor's brother
 better than he have worn vulcan's badge
aaron aside ay and as good as saturninus may
demetrius then why should he despair that knows to court it
 with words fair looks and liberality
 what hast not thou full often struck a doe
 and borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose
aaron why then it seems some certain snatch or so
 would serve your turns
chiron ay so the turn were served
demetrius aaron thou hast hit it
aaron would you had hit it too
 then should not we be tired with this ado
 why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools
 to square for this would it offend you then
 that both should speed
chiron faith not me
demetrius nor me so i were one
aaron for shame be friends and join for that you jar
 tis policy and stratagem must do
 that you affect and so must you resolve
 that what you cannot as you would achieve
 you must perforce accomplish as you may
 take this of me lucrece was not more chaste
 than this lavinia bassianus love
 a speedier course than lingering languishment
 must we pursue and i have found the path
 my lords a solemn hunting is in hand
 there will the lovely roman ladies troop
 the forest walks are wide and spacious
 and many unfrequented plots there are
 fitted by kind for rape and villany
 single you thither then this dainty doe
 and strike her home by force if not by words
 this way or not at all stand you in hope
 come come our empress with her sacred wit
 to villany and vengeance consecrate
 will we acquaint with all that we intend
 and she shall file our engines with advice
 that will not suffer you to square yourselves
 but to your wishes height advance you both
 the emperor's court is like the house of fame
 the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears
 the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull
 there speak and strike brave boys and take
 your turns
 there serve your lusts shadow'd from heaven's eye
 and revel in lavinia's treasury
chiron thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice

 to cool this heat a charm to calm these fits

 the fields are fragrant and the woods are green

 enter aaron with a bag of gold
aaron he that had wit would think that i had none
 to bury so much gold under a tree
 and never after to inherit it
 let him that thinks of me so abjectly
 know that this gold must coin a stratagem
 which cunningly effected will beget
 a very excellent piece of villany
 and so repose sweet gold for their unrest
 hides the gold
 that have their alms out of the empress chest
 enter tamora
tamora my lovely aaron wherefore look'st thou sad
 when every thing doth make a gleeful boast
 the birds chant melody on every bush
 the snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun
 the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
 and make a chequer'd shadow on the ground
 under their sweet shade aaron let us sit
 and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds
 replying shrilly to the welltuned horns
 as if a double hunt were heard at once
 let us sit down and mark their yelping noise
 and after conflict such as was supposed
 the wandering prince and dido once enjoy'd
 when with a happy storm they were surprised
 and curtain'd with a counselkeeping cave
 we may each wreathed in the other's arms
 our pastimes done possess a golden slumber
 whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
 be unto us as is a nurse's song
 of lullaby to bring her babe asleep
aaron madam though venus govern your desires
 saturn is dominator over mine
 what signifies my deadlystanding eye
 my silence and my cloudy melancholy
 my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
 even as an adder when she doth unroll
 to do some fatal execution
 no madam these are no venereal signs
 vengeance is in my heart death in my hand
 blood and revenge are hammering in my head
 hark tamora the empress of my soul
 which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee
 this is the day of doom for bassianus
 his philomel must lose her tongue today
 thy sons make pillage of her chastity
 and wash their hands in bassianus blood
 seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee
 and give the king this fatal plotted scroll
 now question me no more we are espied
 here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
 which dreads not yet their lives destruction
tamora ah my sweet moor sweeter to me than life
aaron no more great empress bassianus comes
 be cross with him and i'll go fetch thy sons
 to back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be
 exit
 enter bassianus and lavinia
bassianus who have we here rome's royal empress
 unfurnish'd of her wellbeseeming troop
 or is it dian habited like her
 who hath abandoned her holy groves
 to see the general hunting in this forest
tamora saucy controller of our private steps
 had i the power that some say dian had
 thy temples should be planted presently
 with horns as was actaeon's and the hounds
 should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs
 unmannerly intruder as thou art
lavinia under your patience gentle empress
 tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning
 and to be doubted that your moor and you
 are singled forth to try experiments
 jove shield your husband from his hounds today
 tis pity they should take him for a stag
bassianus believe me queen your swarth cimmerian
 doth make your honour of his body's hue
 spotted detested and abominable
 why are you sequester'd from all your train
 dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed
 and wander'd hither to an obscure plot
 accompanied but with a barbarous moor
 if foul desire had not conducted you
lavinia and being intercepted in your sport
 great reason that my noble lord be rated
 for sauciness i pray you let us hence
 and let her joy her ravencolour'd love
 this valley fits the purpose passing well
bassianus the king my brother shall have note of this
lavinia ay for these slips have made him noted long
 good king to be so mightily abused
tamora why have i patience to endure all this
 enter demetrius and chiron
demetrius how now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
 why doth your highness look so pale and wan
tamora have i not reason think you to look pale
 these two have ticed me hither to this place
 a barren detested vale you see it is
 the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
 o'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe
 here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
 unless the nightly owl or fatal raven
 and when they show'd me this abhorred pit
 they told me here at dead time of the night
 a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes
 ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins
 would make such fearful and confused cries
 as any mortal body hearing it
 should straight fall mad or else die suddenly
 no sooner had they told this hellish tale
 but straight they told me they would bind me here
 unto the body of a dismal yew
 and leave me to this miserable death
 and then they call'd me foul adulteress
 lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms
 that ever ear did hear to such effect
 and had you not by wondrous fortune come
 this vengeance on me had they executed
 revenge it as you love your mother's life
 or be ye not henceforth call'd my children
demetrius this is a witness that i am thy son
 stabs bassianus
chiron and this for me struck home to show my strength
 also stabs bassianus who dies
lavinia ay come semiramis nay barbarous tamora
 for no name fits thy nature but thy own
tamora give me thy poniard you shall know my boys
 your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong
demetrius stay madam here is more belongs to her
 first thrash the corn then after burn the straw
 this minion stood upon her chastity
 upon her nuptial vow her loyalty
 and with that painted hope braves your mightiness
 and shall she carry this unto her grave
chiron an if she do i would i were an eunuch
 drag hence her husband to some secret hole
 and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust
tamora but when ye have the honey ye desire
 let not this wasp outlive us both to sting
chiron i warrant you madam we will make that sure
 come mistress now perforce we will enjoy
 that nicepreserved honesty of yours
lavinia o tamora thou bear'st a woman's face
tamora i will not hear her speak away with her
lavinia sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word
demetrius listen fair madam let it be your glory
 to see her tears but be your heart to them
 as unrelenting flint to drops of rain
lavinia when did the tiger's young ones teach the dam
 o do not learn her wrath she taught it thee
 the milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble
 even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
 yet every mother breeds not sons alike
 to chiron
 do thou entreat her show a woman pity
chiron what wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard
lavinia tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark
 yet have i heardo could i find it now
 the lion moved with pity did endure
 to have his princely paws pared all away
 some say that ravens foster forlorn children
 the whilst their own birds famish in their nests
 o be to me though thy hard heart say no
 nothing so kind but something pitiful
tamora i know not what it means away with her
lavinia o let me teach thee for my father's sake
 that gave thee life when well he might have
 slain thee
 be not obdurate open thy deaf ears
tamora hadst thou in person ne'er offended me
 even for his sake am i pitiless
 remember boys i pour'd forth tears in vain
 to save your brother from the sacrifice
 but fierce andronicus would not relent
 therefore away with her and use her as you will
 the worse to her the better loved of me
lavinia o tamora be call'd a gentle queen
 and with thine own hands kill me in this place
 for tis not life that i have begg'd so long
 poor i was slain when bassianus died
tamora what begg'st thou then fond woman let me go
lavinia tis present death i beg and one thing more
 that womanhood denies my tongue to tell
 o keep me from their worse than killing lust
 and tumble me into some loathsome pit
 where never man's eye may behold my body
 do this and be a charitable murderer
tamora so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee
 no let them satisfy their lust on thee
demetrius away for thou hast stay'd us here too long
lavinia no grace no womanhood ah beastly creature
 the blot and enemy to our general name
 confusion fall
chiron nay then i'll stop your mouth bring thou her husband
 this is the hole where aaron bid us hide him
 demetrius throws the body of bassianus into the
 pit then exeunt demetrius and chiron dragging
 off lavinia
tamora farewell my sons see that you make her sure
 ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
 till all the andronici be made away
 now will i hence to seek my lovely moor
 and let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r
 exit
 reenter aaron with quintus and martius
aaron come on my lords the better foot before
 straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit
 where i espied the panther fast asleep
quintus my sight is very dull whate'er it bodes
martius and mine i promise you were't not for shame
 well could i leave our sport to sleep awhile
 falls into the pit
quintus what art thou fall'n what subtle hole is this
 whose mouth is cover'd with rudegrowing briers
 upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood
 as fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers
 a very fatal place it seems to me
 speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall
martius o brother with the dismall'st object hurt
 that ever eye with sight made heart lament
aaron aside now will i fetch the king to find them here
 that he thereby may give a likely guess
 how these were they that made away his brother
 exit
martius why dost not comfort me and help me out
 from this unhallowed and bloodstained hole
quintus i am surprised with an uncouth fear
 a chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints
 my heart suspects more than mine eye can see
martius to prove thou hast a truedivining heart
 aaron and thou look down into this den
 and see a fearful sight of blood and death
quintus aaron is gone and my compassionate heart
 will not permit mine eyes once to behold
 the thing whereat it trembles by surmise
 o tell me how it is for ne'er till now
 was i a child to fear i know not what
martius lord bassianus lies embrewed here
 all on a heap like to a slaughter'd lamb
 in this detested dark blooddrinking pit
quintus if it be dark how dost thou know tis he
martius upon his bloody finger he doth wear
 a precious ring that lightens all the hole
 which like a taper in some monument
 doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks
 and shows the ragged entrails of the pit
 so pale did shine the moon on pyramus
 when he by night lay bathed in maiden blood
 o brother help me with thy fainting hand
 if fear hath made thee faint as me it hath
 out of this fell devouring receptacle
 as hateful as cocytus misty mouth
quintus reach me thy hand that i may help thee out
 or wanting strength to do thee so much good
 i may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
 of this deep pit poor bassianus grave
 i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink
martius nor i no strength to climb without thy help
quintus thy hand once more i will not loose again
 till thou art here aloft or i below
 thou canst not come to me i come to thee
 falls in
 enter saturninus with aaron
saturninus along with me i'll see what hole is here
 and what he is that now is leap'd into it
 say who art thou that lately didst descend
 into this gaping hollow of the earth
martius the unhappy son of old andronicus
 brought hither in a most unlucky hour
 to find thy brother bassianus dead
saturninus my brother dead i know thou dost but jest
 he and his lady both are at the lodge
 upon the north side of this pleasant chase
 tis not an hour since i left him there
martius we know not where you left him all alive
 but out alas here have we found him dead
 reenter tamora with attendants titus
 andronicus and lucius
tamora where is my lord the king
saturninus here tamora though grieved with killing grief
tamora where is thy brother bassianus
saturninus now to the bottom dost thou search my wound
 poor bassianus here lies murdered
tamora then all too late i bring this fatal writ
 the complot of this timeless tragedy
 and wonder greatly that man's face can fold
 in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny
 she giveth saturninus a letter
saturninus reads an if we miss to meet him handsomely
 sweet huntsman bassianus tis we mean
 do thou so much as dig the grave for him
 thou know'st our meaning look for thy reward
 among the nettles at the eldertree
 which overshades the mouth of that same pit
 where we decreed to bury bassianus
 do this and purchase us thy lasting friends'
 o tamora was ever heard the like
 this is the pit and this the eldertree
 look sirs if you can find the huntsman out
 that should have murdered bassianus here
aaron my gracious lord here is the bag of gold
saturninus to titus two of thy whelps fell curs of
 bloody kind
 have here bereft my brother of his life
 sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison
 there let them bide until we have devised
 some neverheardof torturing pain for them
tamora what are they in this pit o wondrous thing
 how easily murder is discovered
titus andronicus high emperor upon my feeble knee
 i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed
 that this fell fault of my accursed sons
 accursed if the fault be proved in them
saturninus if it be proved you see it is apparent
 who found this letter tamora was it you
tamora andronicus himself did take it up
titus andronicus i did my lord yet let me be their bail
 for by my father's reverend tomb i vow
 they shall be ready at your highness will
 to answer their suspicion with their lives
saturninus thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me
 some bring the murder'd body some the murderers
 let them not speak a word the guilt is plain
 for by my soul were there worse end than death
 that end upon them should be executed
tamora andronicus i will entreat the king
 fear not thy sons they shall do well enough
titus andronicus come lucius come stay not to talk with them
 exeunt

act ii
scene iv another part of the forest
 enter demetrius and chiron with lavinia ravished
 her hands cut off and her tongue cut out
demetrius so now go tell an if thy tongue can speak
 who twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee
chiron write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so
 an if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe
demetrius see how with signs and tokens she can scrowl
chiron go home call for sweet water wash thy hands
demetrius she hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash
 and so let's leave her to her silent walks
chiron an twere my case i should go hang myself
demetrius if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord
 exeunt demetrius and chiron
 enter marcus
marcus who is this my niece that flies away so fast
 cousin a word where is your husband
 if i do dream would all my wealth would wake me
 if i do wake some planet strike me down
 that i may slumber in eternal sleep
 speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands
 have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
 of her two branches those sweet ornaments
 whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in
 and might not gain so great a happiness
 as have thy love why dost not speak to me
 alas a crimson river of warm blood
 like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind
 doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips
 coming and going with thy honey breath
 but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee
 and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
 ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame
 and notwithstanding all this loss of blood
 as from a conduit with three issuing spouts
 yet do thy cheeks look red as titan's face
 blushing to be encountered with a cloud
 shall i speak for thee shall i say tis so
 o that i knew thy heart and knew the beast
 that i might rail at him to ease my mind
 sorrow concealed like an oven stopp'd
 doth burn the heart to cinders where it is
 fair philomela she but lost her tongue
 and in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind
 but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee
 a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met
 and he hath cut those pretty fingers off
 that could have better sew'd than philomel
 o had the monster seen those lily hands
 tremble like aspenleaves upon a lute
 and make the silken strings delight to kiss them
 he would not then have touch'd them for his life
 or had he heard the heavenly harmony
 which that sweet tongue hath made
 he would have dropp'd his knife and fell asleep
 as cerberus at the thracian poet's feet
 come let us go and make thy father blind
 for such a sight will blind a father's eye
 one hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads
 what will whole months of tears thy father's eyes
 do not draw back for we will mourn with thee
 o could our mourning ease thy misery
 exeunt
 titus andronicus
act iii
scene i rome a street
 enter judges senators and tribunes with martius
 and quintus bound passing on to the place of
 execution titus going before pleading
titus andronicus hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay
 for pity of mine age whose youth was spent
 in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept
 for all my blood in rome's great quarrel shed
 for all the frosty nights that i have watch'd
 and for these bitter tears which now you see
 filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks
 be pitiful to my condemned sons
 whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought
 for two and twenty sons i never wept
 because they died in honour's lofty bed
 lieth down the judges &c pass by him and exeunt
 for these these tribunes in the dust i write
 my heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears
 let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite
 my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush
 o earth i will befriend thee more with rain
 that shall distil from these two ancient urns
 than youthful april shall with all his showers
 in summer's drought i'll drop upon thee still
 in winter with warm tears i'll melt the snow
 and keep eternal springtime on thy face
 so thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood
 enter lucius with his sword drawn
 o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men
 unbind my sons reverse the doom of death
 and let me say that never wept before
 my tears are now prevailing orators
lucius o noble father you lament in vain
 the tribunes hear you not no man is by
 and you recount your sorrows to a stone
titus andronicus ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead
 grave tribunes once more i entreat of you
lucius my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak
titus andronicus why tis no matter man if they did hear
 they would not mark me or if they did mark
 they would not pity me yet plead i must
 and bootless unto them 
 therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones
 who though they cannot answer my distress
 yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes
 for that they will not intercept my tale
 when i do weep they humbly at my feet
 receive my tears and seem to weep with me
 and were they but attired in grave weeds
 rome could afford no tribune like to these
 a stone is soft as waxtribunes more hard than stones
 a stone is silent and offendeth not
 and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death
 rises
 but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn
lucius to rescue my two brothers from their death
 for which attempt the judges have pronounced
 my everlasting doom of banishment
titus andronicus o happy man they have befriended thee
 why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive
 that rome is but a wilderness of tigers
 tigers must prey and rome affords no prey
 but me and mine how happy art thou then
 from these devourers to be banished
 but who comes with our brother marcus here
 enter marcus and lavinia
marcus andronicus titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep
 or if not so thy noble heart to break
 i bring consuming sorrow to thine age
titus andronicus will it consume me let me see it then
marcus andronicus this was thy daughter
titus andronicus why marcus so she is
lucius ay me this object kills me
titus andronicus fainthearted boy arise and look upon her
 speak lavinia what accursed hand
 hath made thee handless in thy father's sight
 what fool hath added water to the sea
 or brought a faggot to brightburning troy
 my grief was at the height before thou camest
 and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds
 give me a sword i'll chop off my hands too
 for they have fought for rome and all in vain
 and they have nursed this woe in feeding life
 in bootless prayer have they been held up
 and they have served me to effectless use
 now all the service i require of them
 is that the one will help to cut the other
 tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands
 for hands to do rome service are but vain
lucius speak gentle sister who hath martyr'd thee
marcus andronicus o that delightful engine of her thoughts
 that blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence
 is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
 where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
 sweet varied notes enchanting every ear
lucius o say thou for her who hath done this deed
marcus andronicus o thus i found her straying in the park
 seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
 that hath received some unrecuring wound
titus andronicus it was my deer and he that wounded her
 hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead
 for now i stand as one upon a rock
 environed with a wilderness of sea
 who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave
 expecting ever when some envious surge
 will in his brinish bowels swallow him
 this way to death my wretched sons are gone
 here stands my other son a banished man
 and here my brother weeping at my woes
 but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
 is dear lavinia dearer than my soul
 had i but seen thy picture in this plight
 it would have madded me what shall i do
 now i behold thy lively body so
 thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears
 nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee
 thy husband he is dead and for his death
 thy brothers are condemn'd and dead by this
 look marcus ah son lucius look on her
 when i did name her brothers then fresh tears
 stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew
 upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd
marcus andronicus perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband
 perchance because she knows them innocent
titus andronicus if they did kill thy husband then be joyful
 because the law hath ta'en revenge on them
 no no they would not do so foul a deed
 witness the sorrow that their sister makes
 gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips
 or make some sign how i may do thee ease
 shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius
 and thou and i sit round about some fountain
 looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
 how they are stain'd as meadows yet not dry
 with miry slime left on them by a flood
 and in the fountain shall we gaze so long
 till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
 and made a brinepit with our bitter tears
 or shall we cut away our hands like thine
 or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
 pass the remainder of our hateful days
 what shall we do let us that have our tongues
 plot some deuce of further misery
 to make us wonder'd at in time to come
lucius sweet father cease your tears for at your grief
 see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps
marcus andronicus patience dear niece good titus dry thine eyes
titus andronicus ah marcus marcus brother well i wot
 thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
 for thou poor man hast drown'd it with thine own
lucius ah my lavinia i will wipe thy cheeks
titus andronicus mark marcus mark i understand her signs
 had she a tongue to speak now would she say
 that to her brother which i said to thee
 his napkin with his true tears all bewet
 can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks
 o what a sympathy of woe is this
 as far from help as limbo is from bliss
 enter aaron
aaron titus andronicus my lord the emperor
 sends thee this wordthat if thou love thy sons
 let marcus lucius or thyself old titus
 or any one of you chop off your hand
 and send it to the king he for the same
 will send thee hither both thy sons alive
 and that shall be the ransom for their fault
titus andronicus o gracious emperor o gentle aaron
 did ever raven sing so like a lark
 that gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise
 with all my heart i'll send the emperor my hand
 good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off
lucius stay father for that noble hand of thine
 that hath thrown down so many enemies
 shall not be sent my hand will serve the turn
 my youth can better spare my blood than you
 and therefore mine shall save my brothers lives
marcus andronicus which of your hands hath not defended rome
 and rear'd aloft the bloody battleaxe
 writing destruction on the enemy's castle
 o none of both but are of high desert
 my hand hath been but idle let it serve
 to ransom my two nephews from their death
 then have i kept it to a worthy end
aaron nay come agree whose hand shall go along
 for fear they die before their pardon come
marcus andronicus my hand shall go
lucius by heaven it shall not go
titus andronicus sirs strive no more such wither'd herbs as these
 are meet for plucking up and therefore mine
lucius sweet father if i shall be thought thy son
 let me redeem my brothers both from death
marcus andronicus and for our father's sake and mother's care
 now let me show a brother's love to thee
titus andronicus agree between you i will spare my hand
lucius then i'll go fetch an axe
marcus andronicus but i will use the axe
 exeunt lucius and marcus
titus andronicus come hither aaron i'll deceive them both
 lend me thy hand and i will give thee mine
aaron aside if that be call'd deceit i will be honest
 and never whilst i live deceive men so
 but i'll deceive you in another sort
 and that you'll say ere half an hour pass
 cuts off titus's hand
 reenter lucius and marcus
titus andronicus now stay your strife what shall be is dispatch'd
 good aaron give his majesty my hand
 tell him it was a hand that warded him
 from thousand dangers bid him bury it
 more hath it merited that let it have
 as for my sons say i account of them
 as jewels purchased at an easy price
 and yet dear too because i bought mine own
aaron i go andronicus and for thy hand
 look by and by to have thy sons with thee
 aside
 their heads i mean o how this villany
 doth fat me with the very thoughts of it
 let fools do good and fair men call for grace
 aaron will have his soul black like his face
 exit
titus andronicus o here i lift this one hand up to heaven
 and bow this feeble ruin to the earth
 if any power pities wretched tears
 to that i call
 to lavinia
 what wilt thou kneel with me
 do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers
 or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
 and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds
 when they do hug him in their melting bosoms
marcus andronicus o brother speak with possibilities
 and do not break into these deep extremes
titus andronicus is not my sorrow deep having no bottom
 then be my passions bottomless with them
marcus andronicus but yet let reason govern thy lament
titus andronicus if there were reason for these miseries
 then into limits could i bind my woes
 when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow
 if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad
 threatening the welkin with his bigswoln face
 and wilt thou have a reason for this coil
 i am the sea hark how her sighs do blow
 she is the weeping welkin i the earth
 then must my sea be moved with her sighs
 then must my earth with her continual tears
 become a deluge overflow'd and drown'd
 for why my bowels cannot hide her woes
 but like a drunkard must i vomit them
 then give me leave for losers will have leave
 to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues
 enter a messenger with two heads and a hand
messenger worthy andronicus ill art thou repaid
 for that good hand thou sent'st the emperor
 here are the heads of thy two noble sons
 and here's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back
 thy griefs their sports thy resolution mock'd
 that woe is me to think upon thy woes
 more than remembrance of my father's death
 exit
marcus andronicus now let hot aetna cool in sicily
 and be my heart an everburning hell
 these miseries are more than may be borne
 to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal
 but sorrow flouted at is double death
lucius ah that this sight should make so deep a wound
 and yet detested life not shrink thereat
 that ever death should let life bear his name
 where life hath no more interest but to breathe
 lavinia kisses titus
marcus andronicus alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless
 as frozen water to a starved snake
titus andronicus when will this fearful slumber have an end
marcus andronicus now farewell flattery die andronicus
 thou dost not slumber see thy two sons heads
 thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here
 thy other banish'd son with this dear sight
 struck pale and bloodless and thy brother i
 even like a stony image cold and numb
 ah now no more will i control thy griefs
 rend off thy silver hair thy other hand
 gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight
 the closing up of our most wretched eyes
 now is a time to storm why art thou still
titus andronicus ha ha ha
marcus andronicus why dost thou laugh it fits not with this hour
titus andronicus why i have not another tear to shed
 besides this sorrow is an enemy
 and would usurp upon my watery eyes
 and make them blind with tributary tears
 then which way shall i find revenge's cave
 for these two heads do seem to speak to me
 and threat me i shall never come to bliss
 till all these mischiefs be return'd again
 even in their throats that have committed them
 come let me see what task i have to do
 you heavy people circle me about
 that i may turn me to each one of you
 and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs
 the vow is made come brother take a head
 and in this hand the other i will bear
 lavinia thou shalt be employ'd these arms
 bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth
 as for thee boy go get thee from my sight
 thou art an exile and thou must not stay
 hie to the goths and raise an army there
 and if you love me as i think you do
 let's kiss and part for we have much to do
 exeunt titus marcus and lavinia
lucius farewell andronicus my noble father
 the wofull'st man that ever lived in rome
 farewell proud rome till lucius come again
 he leaves his pledges dearer than his life
 farewell lavinia my noble sister
 o would thou wert as thou tofore hast been
 but now nor lucius nor lavinia lives
 but in oblivion and hateful griefs
 if lucius live he will requite your wrongs
 and make proud saturnine and his empress
 beg at the gates like tarquin and his queen
 now will i to the goths and raise a power
 to be revenged on rome and saturnine

act iii
scene ii a room in titus's house a banquet set out
 enter titus marcus lavinia and young lucius a boy
titus andronicus so so now sit and look you eat no more
 than will preserve just so much strength in us
 as will revenge these bitter woes of ours
 marcus unknit that sorrowwreathen knot
 thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands
 and cannot passionate our tenfold grief
 with folded arms this poor right hand of mine
 is left to tyrannize upon my breast
 who when my heart all mad with misery
 beats in this hollow prison of my flesh
 then thus i thump it down
 to lavinia
 thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs
 when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating
 thou canst not strike it thus to make it still
 wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans
 or get some little knife between thy teeth
 and just against thy heart make thou a hole
 that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
 may run into that sink and soaking in
 drown the lamenting fool in seasalt tears
marcus andronicus fie brother fie teach her not thus to lay
 such violent hands upon her tender life
titus andronicus how now has sorrow made thee dote already
 why marcus no man should be mad but i
 what violent hands can she lay on her life
 ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands
 to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o'er
 how troy was burnt and he made miserable
 o handle not the theme to talk of hands
 lest we remember still that we have none
 fie fie how franticly i square my talk
 as if we should forget we had no hands
 if marcus did not name the word of hands
 come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this
 here is no drink hark marcus what she says
 i can interpret all her martyr'd signs
 she says she drinks no other drink but tears
 brew'd with her sorrow mesh'd upon her cheeks
 speechless complainer i will learn thy thought
 in thy dumb action will i be as perfect
 as begging hermits in their holy prayers
 thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven
 nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign
 but i of these will wrest an alphabet
 and by still practise learn to know thy meaning
young lucius good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments
 make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale
marcus andronicus alas the tender boy in passion moved
 doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness
titus andronicus peace tender sapling thou art made of tears
 and tears will quickly melt thy life away
 marcus strikes the dish with a knife
 what dost thou strike at marcus with thy knife
marcus andronicus at that that i have kill'd my lord a fly
titus andronicus out on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart
 mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny
 a deed of death done on the innocent
 becomes not titus brother get thee gone
 i see thou art not for my company
marcus andronicus alas my lord i have but kill'd a fly
titus andronicus but how if that fly had a father and mother
 how would he hang his slender gilded wings
 and buzz lamenting doings in the air
 poor harmless fly
 that with his pretty buzzing melody
 came here to make us merry and thou hast
 kill'd him
marcus andronicus pardon me sir it was a black illfavor'd fly
 like to the empress moor therefore i kill'd him
titus andronicus o o o
 then pardon me for reprehending thee
 for thou hast done a charitable deed
 give me thy knife i will insult on him
 flattering myself as if it were the moor
 come hither purposely to poison me
 there's for thyself and that's for tamora
 ah sirrah
 yet i think we are not brought so low
 but that between us we can kill a fly
 that comes in likeness of a coalblack moor
marcus andronicus alas poor man grief has so wrought on him
 he takes false shadows for true substances
titus andronicus come take away lavinia go with me
 i'll to thy closet and go read with thee
 sad stories chanced in the times of old
 come boy and go with me thy sight is young
 and thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle

act iv
scene i rome titus's garden
 enter young lucius and lavinia running after him
 and the boy flies from her with books under his
 arm then enter titus and marcus
young lucius help grandsire help my aunt lavinia
 follows me every where i know not why
 good uncle marcus see how swift she comes
 alas sweet aunt i know not what you mean
marcus andronicus stand by me lucius do not fear thine aunt
titus andronicus she loves thee boy too well to do thee harm
young lucius ay when my father was in rome she did
marcus andronicus what means my niece lavinia by these signs
titus andronicus fear her not lucius somewhat doth she mean
 see lucius see how much she makes of thee
 somewhither would she have thee go with her
 ah boy cornelia never with more care
 read to her sons than she hath read to thee
 sweet poetry and tully's orator
marcus andronicus canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus
young lucius my lord i know not i nor can i guess
 unless some fit or frenzy do possess her
 for i have heard my grandsire say full oft
 extremity of griefs would make men mad
 and i have read that hecuba of troy
 ran mad through sorrow that made me to fear
 although my lord i know my noble aunt
 loves me as dear as e'er my mother did
 and would not but in fury fright my youth
 which made me down to throw my books and fly
 causeless perhaps but pardon me sweet aunt
 and madam if my uncle marcus go
 i will most willingly attend your ladyship
marcus andronicus lucius i will
 lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which
 lucius has let fall
titus andronicus how now lavinia marcus what means this
 some book there is that she desires to see
 which is it girl of these open them boy
 but thou art deeper read and better skill'd
 come and take choice of all my library
 and so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens
 reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed
 why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus
marcus andronicus i think she means that there was more than one
 confederate in the fact ay more there was
 or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge
titus andronicus lucius what book is that she tosseth so
young lucius grandsire tis ovid's metamorphoses
 my mother gave it me
marcus andronicus for love of her that's gone
 perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest
titus andronicus soft see how busily she turns the leaves
 helping her
 what would she find lavinia shall i read
 this is the tragic tale of philomel
 and treats of tereus treason and his rape
 and rape i fear was root of thine annoy
marcus andronicus see brother see note how she quotes the leaves
titus andronicus lavinia wert thou thus surprised sweet girl
 ravish'd and wrong'd as philomela was
 forced in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods see see
 ay such a place there is where we did hunt
 o had we never never hunted there
 pattern'd by that the poet here describes
 by nature made for murders and for rapes
marcus andronicus o why should nature build so foul a den
 unless the gods delight in tragedies
titus andronicus give signs sweet girl for here are none
 but friends
 what roman lord it was durst do the deed
 or slunk not saturnine as tarquin erst
 that left the camp to sin in lucrece bed
marcus andronicus sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me
 apollo pallas jove or mercury
 inspire me that i may this treason find
 my lord look here look here lavinia
 this sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst
 this after me when i have writ my name
 without the help of any hand at all
 he writes his name with his staff and guides it
 with feet and mouth
 cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift
 write thou good niece and here display at last
 what god will have discover'd for revenge
 heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain
 that we may know the traitors and the truth
 she takes the staff in her mouth and guides it
 with her stumps and writes
titus andronicus o do ye read my lord what she hath writ
 stuprum chiron demetrius'
marcus andronicus what what the lustful sons of tamora
 performers of this heinous bloody deed
titus andronicus magni dominator poli
 tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides
marcus andronicus o calm thee gentle lord although i know
 there is enough written upon this earth
 to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
 and arm the minds of infants to exclaims
 my lord kneel down with me lavinia kneel
 and kneel sweet boy the roman hector's hope
 and swear with me as with the woful fere
 and father of that chaste dishonour'd dame
 lord junius brutus sware for lucrece rape
 that we will prosecute by good advice
 mortal revenge upon these traitorous goths
 and see their blood or die with this reproach
titus andronicus tis sure enough an you knew how
 but if you hunt these bearwhelps then beware
 the dam will wake and if she wind you once
 she's with the lion deeply still in league
 and lulls him whilst she playeth on her back
 and when he sleeps will she do what she list
 you are a young huntsman marcus let it alone
 and come i will go get a leaf of brass
 and with a gad of steel will write these words
 and lay it by the angry northern wind
 will blow these sands like sibyl's leaves abroad
 and where's your lesson then boy what say you
young lucius i say my lord that if i were a man
 their mother's bedchamber should not be safe
 for these bad bondmen to the yoke of rome
marcus andronicus ay that's my boy thy father hath full oft
 for his ungrateful country done the like
young lucius and uncle so will i an if i live
titus andronicus come go with me into mine armoury
 lucius i'll fit thee and withal my boy
 shalt carry from me to the empress sons
 presents that i intend to send them both
 come come thou'lt do thy message wilt thou not
young lucius ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire
titus andronicus no boy not so i'll teach thee another course
 lavinia come marcus look to my house
 lucius and i'll go brave it at the court
 ay marry will we sir and we'll be waited on
 exeunt titus lavinia and young lucius
marcus andronicus o heavens can you hear a good man groan
 and not relent or not compassion him
 marcus attend him in his ecstasy
 that hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
 than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield
 but yet so just that he will not revenge
 revenge ye heavens for old andronicus

act iv
scene ii the same a room in the palace
 enter from one side aaron demetrius and
 chiron from the other side young lucius and an
 attendant with a bundle of weapons and verses
 writ upon them
chiron demetrius here's the son of lucius
 he hath some message to deliver us
aaron ay some mad message from his mad grandfather
young lucius my lords with all the humbleness i may
 i greet your honours from andronicus
 aside
 and pray the roman gods confound you both
demetrius gramercy lovely lucius what's the news
young lucius aside that you are both decipher'd that's the news
 for villains mark'd with rapemay it please you
 my grandsire well advised hath sent by me
 the goodliest weapons of his armoury
 to gratify your honourable youth
 the hope of rome for so he bade me say
 and so i do and with his gifts present
 your lordships that whenever you have need
 you may be armed and appointed well
 and so i leave you both
 aside
 like bloody villains
 exeunt young lucius and attendant
demetrius what's here a scroll and written round about
 let's see
 reads
 integer vitae scelerisque purus
 non eget mauri jaculis nec arcu'
chiron o tis a verse in horace i know it well
 i read it in the grammar long ago
aaron ay just a verse in horace right you have it
 aside
 now what a thing it is to be an ass
 here's no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt
 and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines
 that wound beyond their feeling to the quick
 but were our witty empress well afoot
 she would applaud andronicus conceit
 but let her rest in her unrest awhile
 and now young lords was't not a happy star
 led us to rome strangers and more than so
 captives to be advanced to this height
 it did me good before the palace gate
 to brave the tribune in his brother's hearing
demetrius but me more good to see so great a lord
 basely insinuate and send us gifts
aaron had he not reason lord demetrius
 did you not use his daughter very friendly
demetrius i would we had a thousand roman dames
 at such a bay by turn to serve our lust
chiron a charitable wish and full of love
aaron here lacks but your mother for to say amen
chiron and that would she for twenty thousand more
demetrius come let us go and pray to all the gods
 for our beloved mother in her pains
aaron aside pray to the devils the gods have given us over
 trumpets sound within
demetrius why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus
chiron belike for joy the emperor hath a son
demetrius soft who comes here
 enter a nurse with a blackamoor child in her arms
nurse good morrow lords
 o tell me did you see aaron the moor
aaron well more or less or ne'er a whit at all
 here aaron is and what with aaron now
nurse o gentle aaron we are all undone
 now help or woe betide thee evermore
aaron why what a caterwauling dost thou keep
 what dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms
nurse o that which i would hide from heaven's eye
 our empress shame and stately rome's disgrace
 she is deliver'd lords she is deliver'd
aaron to whom
nurse i mean she is brought abed
aaron well god give her good rest what hath he sent her
nurse a devil
aaron why then she is the devil's dam a joyful issue
nurse a joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue
 here is the babe as loathsome as a toad
 amongst the fairest breeders of our clime
 the empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal
 and bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point
aaron zounds ye whore is black so base a hue
 sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure
demetrius villain what hast thou done
aaron that which thou canst not undo
chiron thou hast undone our mother
aaron villain i have done thy mother
demetrius and therein hellish dog thou hast undone
 woe to her chance and damn'd her loathed choice
 accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend
chiron it shall not live
aaron it shall not die
nurse aaron it must the mother wills it so
aaron what must it nurse then let no man but i
 do execution on my flesh and blood
demetrius i'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point
 nurse give it me my sword shall soon dispatch it
aaron sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up
 takes the child from the nurse and draws
 stay murderous villains will you kill your brother
 now by the burning tapers of the sky
 that shone so brightly when this boy was got
 he dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
 that touches this my firstborn son and heir
 i tell you younglings not enceladus
 with all his threatening band of typhon's brood
 nor great alcides nor the god of war
 shall seize this prey out of his father's hands
 what what ye sanguine shallowhearted boys
 ye whitelimed walls ye alehouse painted signs
 coalblack is better than another hue
 in that it scorns to bear another hue
 for all the water in the ocean
 can never turn the swan's black legs to white
 although she lave them hourly in the flood
 tell the empress from me i am of age
 to keep mine own excuse it how she can
demetrius wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus
aaron my mistress is my mistress this myself
 the vigour and the picture of my youth
 this before all the world do i prefer
 this maugre all the world will i keep safe
 or some of you shall smoke for it in rome
demetrius by this our mother is forever shamed
chiron rome will despise her for this foul escape
nurse the emperor in his rage will doom her death
chiron i blush to think upon this ignomy
aaron why there's the privilege your beauty bears
 fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing
 the close enacts and counsels of the heart
 here's a young lad framed of another leer
 look how the black slave smiles upon the father
 as who should say old lad i am thine own'
 he is your brother lords sensibly fed
 of that selfblood that first gave life to you
 and from that womb where you imprison'd were
 he is enfranchised and come to light
 nay he is your brother by the surer side
 although my seal be stamped in his face
nurse aaron what shall i say unto the empress
demetrius advise thee aaron what is to be done
 and we will all subscribe to thy advice
 save thou the child so we may all be safe
aaron then sit we down and let us all consult
 my son and i will have the wind of you
 keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety
 they sit
demetrius how many women saw this child of his
aaron why so brave lords when we join in league
 i am a lamb but if you brave the moor
 the chafed boar the mountain lioness
 the ocean swells not so as aaron storms
 but say again how many saw the child
nurse cornelia the midwife and myself
 and no one else but the deliver'd empress
aaron the empress the midwife and yourself
 two may keep counsel when the third's away
 go to the empress tell her this i said
 he kills the nurse
 weke weke so cries a pig prepared to the spit
demetrius what mean'st thou aaron wherefore didst thou this
aaron o lord sir tis a deed of policy
 shall she live to betray this guilt of ours
 a longtongued babbling gossip no lords no
 and now be it known to you my full intent
 not far one muli lives my countryman
 his wife but yesternight was brought to bed
 his child is like to her fair as you are
 go pack with him and give the mother gold
 and tell them both the circumstance of all
 and how by this their child shall be advanced
 and be received for the emperor's heir
 and substituted in the place of mine
 to calm this tempest whirling in the court
 and let the emperor dandle him for his own
 hark ye lords ye see i have given her physic
 pointing to the nurse
 and you must needs bestow her funeral
 the fields are near and you are gallant grooms
 this done see that you take no longer days
 but send the midwife presently to me
 the midwife and the nurse well made away
 then let the ladies tattle what they please
chiron aaron i see thou wilt not trust the air
 with secrets
demetrius for this care of tamora
 herself and hers are highly bound to thee
 exeunt demetrius and chiron bearing off the
 nurse's body
aaron now to the goths as swift as swallow flies
 there to dispose this treasure in mine arms
 and secretly to greet the empress friends
 come on you thick lipp'd slave i'll bear you hence
 for it is you that puts us to our shifts
 i'll make you feed on berries and on roots
 and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat
 and cabin in a cave and bring you up
 to be a warrior and command a camp

act iv
scene iii the same a public place
 enter titus bearing arrows with letters at the
 ends of them with him marcus young lucius
 publius sempronius caius and other gentlemen
 with bows
titus andronicus come marcus come kinsmen this is the way
 sir boy now let me see your archery
 look ye draw home enough and tis there straight
 terras astraea reliquit
 be you remember'd marcus she's gone she's fled
 sirs take you to your tools you cousins shall
 go sound the ocean and cast your nets
 happily you may catch her in the sea
 yet there's as little justice as at land
 no publius and sempronius you must do it
 tis you must dig with mattock and with spade
 and pierce the inmost centre of the earth
 then when you come to pluto's region
 i pray you deliver him this petition
 tell him it is for justice and for aid
 and that it comes from old andronicus
 shaken with sorrows in ungrateful rome
 ah rome well well i made thee miserable
 what time i threw the people's suffrages
 on him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me
 go get you gone and pray be careful all
 and leave you not a manofwar unsearch'd
 this wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence
 and kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice
marcus andronicus o publius is not this a heavy case
 to see thy noble uncle thus distract
publius therefore my lord it highly us concerns
 by day and night to attend him carefully
 and feed his humour kindly as we may
 till time beget some careful remedy
marcus andronicus kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy
 join with the goths and with revengeful war
 take wreak on rome for this ingratitude
 and vengeance on the traitor saturnine
titus andronicus publius how now how now my masters
 what have you met with her
publius no my good lord but pluto sends you word
 if you will have revenge from hell you shall
 marry for justice she is so employ'd
 he thinks with jove in heaven or somewhere else
 so that perforce you must needs stay a time
titus andronicus he doth me wrong to feed me with delays
 i'll dive into the burning lake below
 and pull her out of acheron by the heels
 marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we
 no bigboned men framed of the cyclops size
 but metal marcus steel to the very back
 yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear
 and sith there's no justice in earth nor hell
 we will solicit heaven and move the gods
 to send down justice for to wreak our wrongs
 come to this gear you are a good archer marcus
 he gives them the arrows
 ad jovem that's for you here ad apollinem'
 ad martem that's for myself
 here boy to pallas here to mercury
 to saturn caius not to saturnine
 you were as good to shoot against the wind
 to it boy marcus loose when i bid
 of my word i have written to effect
 there's not a god left unsolicited
marcus andronicus kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court
 we will afflict the emperor in his pride
titus andronicus now masters draw
 they shoot
 o well said lucius
 good boy in virgo's lap give it pallas
marcus andronicus my lord i aim a mile beyond the moon
 your letter is with jupiter by this
titus andronicus ha ha
 publius publius what hast thou done
 see see thou hast shot off one of taurus horns
marcus andronicus this was the sport my lord when publius shot
 the bull being gall'd gave aries such a knock
 that down fell both the ram's horns in the court
 and who should find them but the empress villain
 she laugh'd and told the moor he should not choose
 but give them to his master for a present
titus andronicus why there it goes god give his lordship joy
 enter a clown with a basket and two pigeons in
 it

titus andronicus why villain art not thou the carrier
clown ay of my pigeons sir nothing else
titus andronicus why didst thou not come from heaven
clown from heaven alas sir i never came there god
 forbid i should be so bold to press to heaven in my
 young days why i am going with my pigeons to the
 tribunal plebs to take up a matter of brawl
 betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men
marcus andronicus why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for
 your oration and let him deliver the pigeons to
 the emperor from you
titus andronicus tell me can you deliver an oration to the emperor

act iv
scene iv the same before the palace
 enter saturninus tamora demetrius chiron
 lords and others saturninus with the arrows in
 his hand that titus shot
saturninus why lords what wrongs are these was ever seen
 an emperor in rome thus overborne
 troubled confronted thus and for the extent
 of egal justice used in such contempt
 my lords you know as know the mightful gods
 however these disturbers of our peace
 buz in the people's ears there nought hath pass'd
 but even with law against the willful sons
 of old andronicus and what an if
 his sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits
 shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks
 his fits his frenzy and his bitterness
 and now he writes to heaven for his redress
 see here's to jove and this to mercury
 this to apollo this to the god of war
 sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome
 what's this but libelling against the senate
 and blazoning our injustice every where
 a goodly humour is it not my lords
 as who would say in rome no justice were
 but if i live his feigned ecstasies
 shall be no shelter to these outrages
 but he and his shall know that justice lives
 in saturninus health whom if she sleep
 he'll so awake as she in fury shall
 cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives
tamora my gracious lord my lovely saturnine
 lord of my life commander of my thoughts
 calm thee and bear the faults of titus age
 the effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
 whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart
 and rather comfort his distressed plight
 than prosecute the meanest or the best
 for these contempts
 aside
 why thus it shall become
 highwitted tamora to gloze with all
 but titus i have touched thee to the quick
 thy lifeblood out if aaron now be wise
 then is all safe the anchor's in the port
 enter clown
 how now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us
clown yea forsooth an your mistership be emperial
tamora empress i am but yonder sits the emperor
clown tis he god and saint stephen give you good den
 i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here
 saturninus reads the letter
saturninus go take him away and hang him presently
clown how much money must i have
tamora come sirrah you must be hanged
clown hanged by'r lady then i have brought up a neck to
 a fair end
 exit guarded
saturninus despiteful and intolerable wrongs
 shall i endure this monstrous villany
 i know from whence this same device proceeds
 may this be borneas if his traitorous sons
 that died by law for murder of our brother
 have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully
 go drag the villain hither by the hair
 nor age nor honour shall shape privilege
 for this proud mock i'll be thy slaughterman
 sly frantic wretch that holp'st to make me great
 in hope thyself should govern rome and me
 enter aemilius
 what news with thee aemilius
aemilius arm arm my lordrome never had more cause
 the goths have gather'd head and with a power
 highresolved men bent to the spoil
 they hither march amain under conduct
 of lucius son to old andronicus
 who threats in course of this revenge to do
 as much as ever coriolanus did
saturninus is warlike lucius general of the goths
 these tidings nip me and i hang the head
 as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms
 ay now begin our sorrows to approach
 tis he the common people love so much
 myself hath often overheard them say
 when i have walked like a private man
 that lucius banishment was wrongfully
 and they have wish'd that lucius were their emperor
tamora why should you fear is not your city strong
saturninus ay but the citizens favor lucius
 and will revolt from me to succor him
tamora king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
 is the sun dimm'd that gnats do fly in it
 the eagle suffers little birds to sing
 and is not careful what they mean thereby
 knowing that with the shadow of his wings
 he can at pleasure stint their melody
 even so mayst thou the giddy men of rome
 then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor
 i will enchant the old andronicus
 with words more sweet and yet more dangerous
 than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep
 when as the one is wounded with the bait
 the other rotted with delicious feed
saturninus but he will not entreat his son for us
tamora if tamora entreat him then he will
 for i can smooth and fill his aged ear
 with golden promises that were his heart
 almost impregnable his old ears deaf
 yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue
 to aemilius
 go thou before be our ambassador
 say that the emperor requests a parley
 of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting
 even at his father's house the old andronicus
saturninus aemilius do this message honourably
 and if he stand on hostage for his safety
 bid him demand what pledge will please him best
aemilius your bidding shall i do effectually
 exit
tamora now will i to that old andronicus
 and temper him with all the art i have
 to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths
 and now sweet emperor be blithe again
 and bury all thy fear in my devices
saturninus then go successantly and plead to him
 exeunt
 titus andronicus
act v
scene i plains near rome
 enter lucius with an army of goths with drum and colours
lucius approved warriors and my faithful friends
 i have received letters from great rome
 which signify what hate they bear their emperor
 and how desirous of our sight they are
 therefore great lords be as your titles witness
 imperious and impatient of your wrongs
 and wherein rome hath done you any scath
 let him make treble satisfaction
first goth brave slip sprung from the great andronicus
 whose name was once our terror now our comfort
 whose high exploits and honourable deeds
 ingrateful rome requites with foul contempt
 be bold in us we'll follow where thou lead'st
 like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
 led by their master to the flowered fields
 and be avenged on cursed tamora
all the goths and as he saith so say we all with him
lucius i humbly thank him and i thank you all
 but who comes here led by a lusty goth
 enter a goth leading aaron with his child in his arms
second goth renowned lucius from our troops i stray'd
 to gaze upon a ruinous monastery
 and as i earnestly did fix mine eye
 upon the wasted building suddenly
 i heard a child cry underneath a wall
 i made unto the noise when soon i heard
 the crying babe controll'd with this discourse
 peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam
 did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
 had nature lent thee but thy mother's look
 villain thou mightst have been an emperor
 but where the bull and cow are both milkwhite
 they never do beget a coalblack calf
 peace villain peace'even thus he rates
 the babe
 for i must bear thee to a trusty goth
 who when he knows thou art the empress babe
 will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake'
 with this my weapon drawn i rush'd upon him
 surprised him suddenly and brought him hither
 to use as you think needful of the man
lucius o worthy goth this is the incarnate devil
 that robb'd andronicus of his good hand
 this is the pearl that pleased your empress eye
 and here's the base fruit of his burning lust
 say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey
 this growing image of thy fiendlike face
 why dost not speak what deaf not a word
 a halter soldiers hang him on this tree
 and by his side his fruit of bastardy
aaron touch not the boy he is of royal blood
lucius too like the sire for ever being good
 first hang the child that he may see it sprawl
 a sight to vex the father's soul withal
 get me a ladder
 a ladder brought which aaron is made to ascend
aaron lucius save the child
 and bear it from me to the empress
 if thou do this i'll show thee wondrous things
 that highly may advantage thee to hear
 if thou wilt not befall what may befall
 i'll speak no more but vengeance rot you all'
lucius say on an if it please me which thou speak'st
 thy child shall live and i will see it nourish'd
aaron an if it please thee why assure thee lucius
 twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak
 for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres
 acts of black night abominable deeds
 complots of mischief treason villanies
 ruthful to hear yet piteously perform'd
 and this shall all be buried by my death
 unless thou swear to me my child shall live
lucius tell on thy mind i say thy child shall live
aaron swear that he shall and then i will begin
lucius who should i swear by thou believest no god
 that granted how canst thou believe an oath
aaron what if i do not as indeed i do not
 yet for i know thou art religious
 and hast a thing within thee called conscience
 with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
 which i have seen thee careful to observe
 therefore i urge thy oath for that i know
 an idiot holds his bauble for a god
 and keeps the oath which by that god he swears
 to that i'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow
 by that same god what god soe'er it be
 that thou adorest and hast in reverence
 to save my boy to nourish and bring him up
 or else i will discover nought to thee
lucius even by my god i swear to thee i will
aaron first know thou i begot him on the empress
lucius o most insatiate and luxurious woman
aaron tut lucius this was but a deed of charity
 to that which thou shalt hear of me anon
 twas her two sons that murder'd bassianus
 they cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
 and cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st
lucius o detestable villain call'st thou that trimming
aaron why she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd and twas
 trim sport for them that had the doing of it
lucius o barbarous beastly villains like thyself
aaron indeed i was their tutor to instruct them
 that codding spirit had they from their mother
 as sure a card as ever won the set
 that bloody mind i think they learn'd of me
 as true a dog as ever fought at head
 well let my deeds be witness of my worth
 i train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
 where the dead corpse of bassianus lay
 i wrote the letter that thy father found
 and hid the gold within the letter mention'd
 confederate with the queen and her two sons
 and what not done that thou hast cause to rue
 wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it
 i play'd the cheater for thy father's hand
 and when i had it drew myself apart
 and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
 i pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
 when for his hand he had his two sons heads
 beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily
 that both mine eyes were rainy like to his 
 and when i told the empress of this sport
 she swooned almost at my pleasing tale
 and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses
first goth what canst thou say all this and never blush
aaron ay like a black dog as the saying is
lucius art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds
aaron ay that i had not done a thousand more
 even now i curse the dayand yet i think
 few come within the compass of my curse
 wherein i did not some notorious ill
 as kill a man or else devise his death
 ravish a maid or plot the way to do it
 accuse some innocent and forswear myself
 set deadly enmity between two friends
 make poor men's cattle break their necks
 set fire on barns and haystacks in the night
 and bid the owners quench them with their tears
 oft have i digg'd up dead men from their graves
 and set them upright at their dear friends doors
 even when their sorrows almost were forgot
 and on their skins as on the bark of trees
 have with my knife carved in roman letters
 let not your sorrow die though i am dead'
 tut i have done a thousand dreadful things
 as willingly as one would kill a fly
 and nothing grieves me heartily indeed
 but that i cannot do ten thousand more
lucius bring down the devil for he must not die
 so sweet a death as hanging presently
aaron if there be devils would i were a devil
 to live and burn in everlasting fire
 so i might have your company in hell
 but to torment you with my bitter tongue
lucius sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more
 enter a goth
third goth my lord there is a messenger from rome
 desires to be admitted to your presence
lucius let him come near
 enter aemilius
 welcome aemilius what's the news from rome
aemilius lord lucius and you princes of the goths
 the roman emperor greets you all by me
 and for he understands you are in arms
 he craves a parley at your father's house
 willing you to demand your hostages
 and they shall be immediately deliver'd
first goth what says our general
lucius aemilius let the emperor give his pledges
 unto my father and my uncle marcus
 and we will come march away

 titus andronicus
act v
scene ii rome before titus's house
 enter tamora demetrius and chiron disguised
tamora thus in this strange and sad habiliment
 i will encounter with andronicus
 and say i am revenge sent from below
 to join with him and right his heinous wrongs
 knock at his study where they say he keeps
 to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge
 tell him revenge is come to join with him
 and work confusion on his enemies
 they knock
 enter titus above
titus andronicus who doth molest my contemplation
 is it your trick to make me ope the door
 that so my sad decrees may fly away
 and all my study be to no effect
 you are deceived for what i mean to do
 see here in bloody lines i have set down
 and what is written shall be executed
tamora titus i am come to talk with thee
titus andronicus no not a word how can i grace my talk
 wanting a hand to give it action
 thou hast the odds of me therefore no more
tamora if thou didst know me thou wouldest talk with me
titus andronicus i am not mad i know thee well enough
 witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines
 witness these trenches made by grief and care
 witness the tiring day and heavy night
 witness all sorrow that i know thee well
 for our proud empress mighty tamora
 is not thy coming for my other hand
tamora know thou sad man i am not tamora
 she is thy enemy and i thy friend
 i am revenge sent from the infernal kingdom
 to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
 by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes
 come down and welcome me to this world's light
 confer with me of murder and of death
 there's not a hollow cave or lurkingplace
 no vast obscurity or misty vale
 where bloody murder or detested rape
 can couch for fear but i will find them out
 and in their ears tell them my dreadful name
 revenge which makes the foul offender quake
titus andronicus art thou revenge and art thou sent to me
 to be a torment to mine enemies
tamora i am therefore come down and welcome me
titus andronicus do me some service ere i come to thee
 lo by thy side where rape and murder stands
 now give me some surance that thou art revenge
 stab them or tear them on thy chariotwheels
 and then i'll come and be thy waggoner
 and whirl along with thee about the globe
 provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet
 to hale thy vengeful waggon swift away
 and find out murderers in their guilty caves
 and when thy car is loaden with their heads
 i will dismount and by the waggonwheel
 trot like a servile footman all day long
 even from hyperion's rising in the east
 until his very downfall in the sea
 and day by day i'll do this heavy task
 so thou destroy rapine and murder there
tamora these are my ministers and come with me
titus andronicus are these thy ministers what are they call'd
tamora rapine and murder therefore called so
 cause they take vengeance of such kind of men
titus andronicus good lord how like the empress sons they are
 and you the empress but we worldly men
 have miserable mad mistaking eyes
 o sweet revenge now do i come to thee
 and if one arm's embracement will content thee
 i will embrace thee in it by and by
 exit above
tamora this closing with him fits his lunacy
 whate'er i forge to feed his brainsick fits
 do you uphold and maintain in your speeches
 for now he firmly takes me for revenge
 and being credulous in this mad thought
 i'll make him send for lucius his son
 and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure
 i'll find some cunning practise out of hand
 to scatter and disperse the giddy goths
 or at the least make them his enemies
 see here he comes and i must ply my theme
 enter titus below
titus andronicus long have i been forlorn and all for thee
 welcome dread fury to my woful house
 rapine and murder you are welcome too
 how like the empress and her sons you are
 well are you fitted had you but a moor
 could not all hell afford you such a devil
 for well i wot the empress never wags
 but in her company there is a moor
 and would you represent our queen aright
 it were convenient you had such a devil
 but welcome as you are what shall we do
tamora what wouldst thou have us do andronicus
demetrius show me a murderer i'll deal with him
chiron show me a villain that hath done a rape
 and i am sent to be revenged on him
tamora show me a thousand that have done thee wrong
 and i will be revenged on them all
titus andronicus look round about the wicked streets of rome
 and when thou find'st a man that's like thyself
 good murder stab him he's a murderer
 go thou with him and when it is thy hap
 to find another that is like to thee
 good rapine stab him he's a ravisher
 go thou with them and in the emperor's court
 there is a queen attended by a moor
 well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion
 for up and down she doth resemble thee
 i pray thee do on them some violent death
 they have been violent to me and mine
tamora well hast thou lesson'd us this shall we do
 but would it please thee good andronicus
 to send for lucius thy thricevaliant son
 who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths
 and bid him come and banquet at thy house
 when he is here even at thy solemn feast
 i will bring in the empress and her sons
 the emperor himself and all thy foes
 and at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel
 and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart
 what says andronicus to this device
titus andronicus marcus my brother tis sad titus calls
 enter marcus
 go gentle marcus to thy nephew lucius
 thou shalt inquire him out among the goths
 bid him repair to me and bring with him
 some of the chiefest princes of the goths

 feast at my house and he shall feast with them
 this do thou for my love and so let him
 as he regards his aged father's life
marcus andronicus this will i do and soon return again
 exit
tamora now will i hence about thy business
 and take my ministers along with me
titus andronicus nay nay let rape and murder stay with me
 or else i'll call my brother back again
 and cleave to no revenge but lucius
tamora aside to her sons what say you boys will you
 bide with him
 whiles i go tell my lord the emperor
 how i have govern'd our determined jest
 yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair
 and tarry with him till i turn again
titus andronicus aside i know them all though they suppose me mad
 and will o'erreach them in their own devices

 o villains chiron and demetrius
 here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud
 this goodly summer with your winter mix'd
 you kill'd her husband and for that vile fault
 two of her brothers were condemn'd to death
 my hand cut off and made a merry jest
 both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear
 than hands or tongue her spotless chastity
 inhuman traitors you constrain'd and forced
 what would you say if i should let you speak
 villains for shame you could not beg for grace
 hark wretches how i mean to martyr you
 this one hand yet is left to cut your throats
 whilst that lavinia tween her stumps doth hold
 the basin that receives your guilty blood
 you know your mother means to feast with me
 and calls herself revenge and thinks me mad
 hark villains i will grind your bones to dust
 and with your blood and it i'll make a paste
 and of the paste a coffin i will rear
 and make two pasties of your shameful heads
 and bid that strumpet your unhallow'd dam
 like to the earth swallow her own increase
 this is the feast that i have bid her to
 and this the banquet she shall surfeit on
 for worse than philomel you used my daughter
 and worse than progne i will be revenged
 and now prepare your throats lavinia come

 receive the blood and when that they are dead
 let me go grind their bones to powder small
 and with this hateful liquor temper it
 and in that paste let their vile heads be baked

 more stern and bloody than the centaurs feast
 so now bring them in for i'll play the cook
 and see them ready gainst their mother comes

 till he be brought unto the empress face
 for testimony of her foul proceedings
 and see the ambush of our friends be strong
 i fear the emperor means no good to us

saturninus why art thou thus attired andronicus
titus andronicus because i would be sure to have all well
 to entertain your highness and your empress
tamora we are beholding to you good andronicus
titus andronicus an if your highness knew my heart you were
 my lord the emperor resolve me this
 was it well done of rash virginius
 to slay his daughter with his own right hand
 because she was enforced stain'd and deflower'd
saturninus it was andronicus
titus andronicus your reason mighty lord
saturninus because the girl should not survive her shame
 and by her presence still renew his sorrows
titus andronicus a reason mighty strong and effectual
 a pattern precedent and lively warrant
 for me most wretched to perform the like
 die die lavinia and thy shame with thee
 kills lavinia
 and with thy shame thy father's sorrow die
saturninus what hast thou done unnatural and unkind
titus andronicus kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind
 i am as woful as virginius was
 and have a thousand times more cause than he
 to do this outrage and it now is done
saturninus what was she ravish'd tell who did the deed
titus andronicus will't please you eat will't please your
 highness feed
tamora why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus
titus andronicus not i twas chiron and demetrius
 they ravish'd her and cut away her tongue
 and they twas they that did her all this wrong
saturninus go fetch them hither to us presently
titus andronicus why there they are both baked in that pie
 whereof their mother daintily hath fed
 eating the flesh that she herself hath bred

 kills tamora
saturninus die frantic wretch for this accursed deed
 kills titus
lucius can the son's eye behold his father bleed
 there's meed for meed death for a deadly deed
 kills saturninus a great tumult lucius marcus
 and others go up into the balcony
marcus andronicus you sadfaced men people and sons of rome
 by uproar sever'd like a flight of fowl
 scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts
 o let me teach you how to knit again
 this scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf
 these broken limbs again into one body
 lest rome herself be bane unto herself
 and she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to
 like a forlorn and desperate castaway
 do shameful execution on herself
 but if my frosty signs and chaps of age
 grave witnesses of true experience
 cannot induce you to attend my words
 to lucius
 speak rome's dear friend as erst our ancestor
 when with his solemn tongue he did discourse
 to lovesick dido's sad attending ear
 the story of that baleful burning night
 when subtle greeks surprised king priam's troy
 tell us what sinon hath bewitch'd our ears
 or who hath brought the fatal engine in
 that gives our troy our rome the civil wound
 my heart is not compact of flint nor steel
 nor can i utter all our bitter grief
 but floods of tears will drown my oratory
 and break my utterance even in the time
 when it should move you to attend me most
 lending your kind commiseration
 here is a captain let him tell the tale
 your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak
lucius then noble auditory be it known to you
 that cursed chiron and demetrius
 were they that murdered our emperor's brother
 and they it were that ravished our sister
 for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded
 our father's tears despised and basely cozen'd
 of that true hand that fought rome's quarrel out
 and sent her enemies unto the grave
 lastly myself unkindly banished
 the gates shut on me and turn'd weeping out
 to beg relief among rome's enemies
 who drown'd their enmity in my true tears
 and oped their arms to embrace me as a friend
 i am the turned forth be it known to you
 that have preserved her welfare in my blood
 and from her bosom took the enemy's point
 sheathing the steel in my adventurous body
 alas you know i am no vaunter i
 my scars can witness dumb although they are
 that my report is just and full of truth
 but soft methinks i do digress too much
 citing my worthless praise o pardon me
 for when no friends are by men praise themselves
marcus andronicus now is my turn to speak behold this child
 pointing to the child in the arms of an attendant
 of this was tamora delivered
 the issue of an irreligious moor
 chief architect and plotter of these woes
 the villain is alive in titus house
 and as he is to witness this is true
 now judge what cause had titus to revenge
 these wrongs unspeakable past patience
 or more than any living man could bear
 now you have heard the truth what say you romans
 have we done aught amissshow us wherein
 and from the place where you behold us now
 the poor remainder of andronici
 will hand in hand all headlong cast us down
 and on the ragged stones beat forth our brains
 and make a mutual closure of our house
 speak romans speak and if you say we shall
 lo hand in hand lucius and i will fall
aemilius come come thou reverend man of rome
 and bring our emperor gently in thy hand
 lucius our emperor for well i know
 the common voice do cry it shall be so
all lucius all hail rome's royal emperor
marcus andronicus go go into old titus sorrowful house
 to attendants
 and hither hale that misbelieving moor
 to be adjudged some direful slaughtering death
 as punishment for his most wicked life
 exeunt attendants
 lucius marcus and the others descend
all lucius all hail rome's gracious governor
lucius thanks gentle romans may i govern so
 to heal rome's harms and wipe away her woe
 but gentle people give me aim awhile
 for nature puts me to a heavy task
 stand all aloof but uncle draw you near
 to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk
 o take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips
 kissing titus
 these sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstain'd face
 the last true duties of thy noble son
marcus andronicus tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss
 thy brother marcus tenders on thy lips
 o were the sum of these that i should pay
 countless and infinite yet would i pay them
lucius come hither boy come come and learn of us
 to melt in showers thy grandsire loved thee well
 many a time he danced thee on his knee
 sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow
 many a matter hath he told to thee
 meet and agreeing with thine infancy
 in that respect then like a loving child
 shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring
 because kind nature doth require it so
 friends should associate friends in grief and woe
 bid him farewell commit him to the grave
 do him that kindness and take leave of him
young lucius o grandsire grandsire even with all my heart
 would i were dead so you did live again
 o lord i cannot speak to him for weeping
 my tears will choke me if i ope my mouth
 reenter attendants with aaron
aemilius you sad andronici have done with woes
 give sentence on this execrable wretch
 that hath been breeder of these dire events
lucius set him breastdeep in earth and famish him
 there let him stand and rave and cry for food
 if any one relieves or pities him
 for the offence he dies this is our doom
 some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth
aaron o why should wrath be mute and fury dumb
 i am no baby i that with base prayers
 i should repent the evils i have done
 ten thousand worse than ever yet i did
 would i perform if i might have my will
 if one good deed in all my life i did
 i do repent it from my very soul
lucius some loving friends convey the emperor hence
 and give him burial in his father's grave
 my father and lavinia shall forthwith
 be closed in our household's monument
 as for that heinous tiger tamora
 no funeral rite nor man m mourning weeds
 no mournful bell shall ring her burial
 but throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey
 her life was beastlike and devoid of pity
 and being so shall have like want of pity
 see justice done on aaron that damn'd moor
 by whom our heavy haps had their beginning
 then afterwards to order well the state
 that like events may ne'er it ruinate
 exeunt
 a lover's complaint
from off a hill whose concave womb reworded
a plaintful story from a sistering vale
my spirits to attend this double voice accorded
and down i laid to list the sadtuned tale
ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
tearing of papers breaking rings atwain
storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain
upon her head a platted hive of straw
which fortified her visage from the sun
whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
the carcass of beauty spent and done
time had not scythed all that youth begun
nor youth all quit but spite of heaven's fell rage
some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age
oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
which on it had conceited characters
laundering the silken figures in the brine
that season'd woe had pelleted in tears
and often reading what contents it bears
as often shrieking undistinguish'd woe
in clamours of all size both high and low
sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride
as they did battery to the spheres intend
sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
to the orbed earth sometimes they do extend
their view right on anon their gazes lend
to every place at once and nowhere fix'd
the mind and sight distractedly commix'd
her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
for some untuck'd descended her sheaved hat
hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
some in her threaden fillet still did bide
and true to bondage would not break from thence
though slackly braided in loose negligence
a thousand favours from a maund she drew
of amber crystal and of beaded jet
which one by one she in a river threw
upon whose weeping margent she was set
like usury applying wet to wet
or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
where want cries some but where excess begs all
of folded schedules had she many a one
which she perused sigh'd tore and gave the flood
crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone
bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood
with sleided silk feat and affectedly
enswathed and seal'd to curious secrecy
these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
and often kiss'd and often gan to tear
cried o false blood thou register of lies
what unapproved witness dost thou bear
ink would have seem'd more black and damned here'
this said in top of rage the lines she rents
big discontent so breaking their contents
a reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
of court of city and had let go by
the swiftest hours observed as they flew
towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
and privileged by age desires to know
in brief the grounds and motives of her woe
so slides he down upon his grained bat
and comelydistant sits he by her side
when he again desires her being sat
her grievance with his hearing to divide
if that from him there may be aught applied
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
'tis promised in the charity of age
'father she says though in me you behold
the injury of many a blasting hour
let it not tell your judgment i am old
not age but sorrow over me hath power
i might as yet have been a spreading flower
fresh to myself if i had selfapplied
love to myself and to no love beside
'but woe is me too early i attended
a youthful suitit was to gain my grace
of one by nature's outwards so commended
that maidens eyes stuck over all his face
love lack'd a dwelling and made him her place
and when in his fair parts she did abide
she was new lodged and newly deified
'his browny locks did hang in crooked curls
and every light occasion of the wind
upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
what's sweet to do to do will aptly find
each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
for on his visage was in little drawn
what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn
'small show of man was yet upon his chin
his phoenix down began but to appear
like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
whose bare outbragg'd the web it seem'd to wear
yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear
and nice affections wavering stood in doubt
if best were as it was or best without
'his qualities were beauteous as his form
for maidentongued he was and thereof free
yet if men moved him was he such a storm
as oft twixt may and april is to see
when winds breathe sweet untidy though they be
his rudeness so with his authorized youth
did livery falseness in a pride of truth
'well could he ride and often men would say
'that horse his mettle from his rider takes
proud of subjection noble by the sway
what rounds what bounds what course what stop
he makes'
and controversy hence a question takes
whether the horse by him became his deed
or he his manage by the welldoing steed
'but quickly on this side the verdict went
his real habitude gave life and grace
to appertainings and to ornament
accomplish'd in himself not in his case
all aids themselves made fairer by their place
came for additions yet their purposed trim
pieced not his grace but were all graced by him
'so on the tip of his subduing tongue
all kinds of arguments and question deep
all replication prompt and reason strong
for his advantage still did wake and sleep
to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep
he had the dialect and different skill
catching all passions in his craft of will
'that he did in the general bosom reign
of young of old and sexes both enchanted
to dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
in personal duty following where he haunted
consents bewitch'd ere he desire have granted
and dialogued for him what he would say
ask'd their own wills and made their wills obey
'many there were that did his picture get
to serve their eyes and in it put their mind
like fools that in th imagination set
the goodly objects which abroad they find
of lands and mansions theirs in thought assign'd
and labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them
'so many have that never touch'd his hand
sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart
my woeful self that did in freedom stand
and was my own feesimple not in part
what with his art in youth and youth in art
threw my affections in his charmed power
reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower
'yet did i not as some my equals did
demand of him nor being desired yielded
finding myself in honour so forbid
with safest distance i mine honour shielded
experience for me many bulwarks builded
of proofs newbleeding which remain'd the foil
of this false jewel and his amorous spoil
'but ah who ever shunn'd by precedent
the destined ill she must herself assay
or forced examples gainst her own content
to put the bypast perils in her way
counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
for when we rage advice is often seen
by blunting us to make our wits more keen
'nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
that we must curb it upon others proof
to be forbod the sweets that seem so good
for fear of harms that preach in our behoof
o appetite from judgment stand aloof
the one a palate hath that needs will taste
though reason weep and cry it is thy last'
'for further i could say this man's untrue'
and knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
heard where his plants in others orchards grew
saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
thought characters and words merely but art
and bastards of his foul adulterate heart
'and long upon these terms i held my city
till thus he gan besiege me gentle maid
have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
and be not of my holy vows afraid
that's to ye sworn to none was ever said
for feasts of love i have been call'd unto
till now did ne'er invite nor never woo
''all my offences that abroad you see
are errors of the blood none of the mind
love made them not with acture they may be
where neither party is nor true nor kind
they sought their shame that so their shame did find
and so much less of shame in me remains
by how much of me their reproach contains
''among the many that mine eyes have seen
not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd
or my affection put to the smallest teen
or any of my leisures ever charm'd
harm have i done to them but ne'er was harm'd
kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free
and reign'd commanding in his monarchy
''look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me
of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
of grief and blushes aptly understood
in bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood
effects of terror and dear modesty
encamp'd in hearts but fighting outwardly
''and lo behold these talents of their hair
with twisted metal amorously impleach'd
i have received from many a several fair
their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd
with the annexions of fair gems enrich'd
and deepbrain'd sonnets that did amplify
each stone's dear nature worth and quality
''the diamondwhy twas beautiful and hard
whereto his invised properties did tend
the deepgreen emerald in whose fresh regard
weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
the heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend
with objects manifold each several stone
with wit well blazon'd smiled or made some moan
''lo all these trophies of affections hot
of pensived and subdued desires the tender
nature hath charged me that i hoard them not
but yield them up where i myself must render
that is to you my origin and ender
for these of force must your oblations be
since i their altar you enpatron me
''o then advance of yours that phraseless hand
whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise
take all these similes to your own command
hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise
what me your minister for you obeys
works under you and to your audit comes
their distract parcels in combined sums
''lo this device was sent me from a nun
or sister sanctified of holiest note
which late her noble suit in court did shun
whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
for she was sought by spirits of richest coat
but kept cold distance and did thence remove
to spend her living in eternal love
''but o my sweet what labour is't to leave
the thing we have not mastering what not strives
playing the place which did no form receive
playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
she that her fame so to herself contrives
the scars of battle scapeth by the flight
and makes her absence valiant not her might
''o pardon me in that my boast is true
the accident which brought me to her eye
upon the moment did her force subdue
and now she would the caged cloister fly
religious love put out religion's eye
not to be tempted would she be immured
and now to tempt all liberty procured
''how mighty then you are o hear me tell
the broken bosoms that to me belong
have emptied all their fountains in my well
and mine i pour your ocean all among
i strong o'er them and you o'er me being strong
must for your victory us all congest
as compound love to physic your cold breast
''my parts had power to charm a sacred nun
who disciplined ay dieted in grace
believed her eyes when they to assail begun
all vows and consecrations giving place
o most potential love vow bond nor space
in thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
for thou art all and all things else are thine
''when thou impressest what are precepts worth
of stale example when thou wilt inflame
how coldly those impediments stand forth
of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame
love's arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense
'gainst shame
and sweetens in the suffering pangs it bears
the aloes of all forces shocks and fears
''now all these hearts that do on mine depend
feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine
and supplicant their sighs to you extend
to leave the battery that you make gainst mine
lending soft audience to my sweet design
and credent soul to that strongbonded oath
that shall prefer and undertake my troth'
'this said his watery eyes he did dismount
whose sights till then were levell'd on my face
each cheek a river running from a fount
with brinish current downward flow'd apace
o how the channel to the stream gave grace
who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
that flame through water which their hue encloses
'o father what a hell of witchcraft lies
in the small orb of one particular tear
but with the inundation of the eyes
what rocky heart to water will not wear
what breast so cold that is not warmed here
o cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
both fire from hence and chill extincture hath
'for lo his passion but an art of craft
even there resolved my reason into tears
there my white stole of chastity i daff'd
shook off my sober guards and civil fears
appear to him as he to me appears
all melting though our drops this difference bore
his poison'd me and mine did him restore
'in him a plenitude of subtle matter
applied to cautels all strange forms receives
of burning blushes or of weeping water
or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves
in either's aptness as it best deceives
to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows
'that not a heart which in his level came
could scape the hail of his allhurting aim
showing fair nature is both kind and tame
and veil'd in them did win whom he would maim
against the thing he sought he would exclaim
when he most burn'd in heartwish'd luxury
he preach'd pure maid and praised cold chastity
'thus merely with the garment of a grace
the naked and concealed fiend he cover'd
that th unexperient gave the tempter place
which like a cherubin above them hover'd
who young and simple would not be so lover'd
ay me i fell and yet do question make
what i should do again for such a sake
'o that infected moisture of his eye
o that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd
o that forced thunder from his heart did fly
o that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd
o all that borrow'd motion seeming owed
would yet again betray the forebetray'd
and new pervert a reconciled maid'

 the rape of lucrece
 the argument
lucius tarquinius for his excessive pride surnamed superbus
after he had caused his own fatherinlaw servius tullius to be
cruelly murdered and contrary to the roman laws and customs
not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages had
possessed himself of the kingdom went accompanied with his sons
and other noblemen of rome to besiege ardea during which siege
the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of
sextus tarquinius the king's son in their discourses after
supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife among
whom collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife
lucretia in that pleasant humour they posted to rome and
intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of
that which every one had before avouched only collatinus finds
his wife though it were late in the night spinning amongst her
maids the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling or
in several disports whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus
the victory and his wife the fame at that time sextus
tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece beauty yet smothering
his passions for the present departed with the rest back to the
camp from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself and
was according to his estate royally entertained and lodged by
lucrece at collatium the same night he treacherously stealeth
into her chamber violently ravished her and early in the
morning speedeth away lucrece in this lamentable plight
hastily dispatcheth messengers one to rome for her father
another to the camp for collatine they came the one
accompanied with junius brutus the other with publius valerius
and finding lucrece attired in mourning habit demanded the cause
of her sorrow she first taking an oath of them for her
revenge revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing and
withal suddenly stabbed herself which done with one consent
they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
tarquins and bearing the dead body to rome brutus acquainted
the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a
bitter invective against the tyranny of the king wherewith the
people were so moved that with one consent and a general
acclamation the tarquins were all exiled and the state
government changed from kings to consuls
 the rape of lucrece
from the besieged ardea all in post
borne by the trustless wings of false desire
lustbreathed tarquin leaves the roman host
and to collatium bears the lightless fire
which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire
and girdle with embracing flames the waist
of collatine's fair love lucrece the chaste
haply that name of chaste unhappily set
this bateless edge on his keen appetite
when collatine unwisely did not let
to praise the clear unmatched red and white
which triumph'd in that sky of his delight
where mortal stars as bright as heaven's beauties
with pure aspects did him peculiar duties
for he the night before in tarquin's tent
unlock'd the treasure of his happy state
what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
in the possession of his beauteous mate
reckoning his fortune at such highproud rate
that kings might be espoused to more fame
but king nor peer to such a peerless dame
o happiness enjoy'd but of a few
and if possess'd as soon decay'd and done
as is the morning's silvermelting dew
against the golden splendor of the sun
an expired date cancell'd ere well begun
honour and beauty in the owner's arms
are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms
beauty itself doth of itself persuade
the eyes of men without an orator
what needeth then apologies be made
to set forth that which is so singular
or why is collatine the publisher
of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
from thievish ears because it is his own
perchance his boast of lucrece sovereignty
suggested this proud issue of a king
for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be
perchance that envy of so rich a thing
braving compare disdainfully did sting
his highpitch'd thoughts that meaner men should vaunt
that golden hap which their superiors want
but some untimely thought did instigate
his alltootimeless speed if none of those
his honour his affairs his friends his state
neglected all with swift intent he goes
to quench the coal which in his liver glows
o rash false heat wrapp'd in repentant cold
thy hasty spring still blasts and ne'er grows old
when at collatium this false lord arrived
well was he welcomed by the roman dame
within whose face beauty and virtue strived
which of them both should underprop her fame
when virtue bragg'd beauty would blush for shame
when beauty boasted blushes in despite
virtue would stain that o'er with silver white
but beauty in that white intituled
from venus doves doth challenge that fair field
then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red
which virtue gave the golden age to gild
their silver cheeks and call'd it then their shield
teaching them thus to use it in the fight
when shame assail'd the red should fence the white
this heraldry in lucrece face was seen
argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
of either's colour was the other queen
proving from world's minority their right
yet their ambition makes them still to fight
the sovereignty of either being so great
that oft they interchange each other's seat
their silent war of lilies and of roses
which tarquin view'd in her fair face's field
in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses
where lest between them both it should be kill'd
the coward captive vanquished doth yield
to those two armies that would let him go
rather than triumph in so false a foe
now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue
the niggard prodigal that praised her so
in that high task hath done her beauty wrong
which far exceeds his barren skill to show
therefore that praise which collatine doth owe
enchanted tarquin answers with surmise
in silent wonder of stillgazing eyes
this earthly saint adored by this devil
little suspecteth the false worshipper
for unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil
birds never limed no secret bushes fear
so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
and reverend welcome to her princely guest
whose inward ill no outward harm express'd
for that he colour'd with his high estate
hiding base sin in plaits of majesty
that nothing in him seem'd inordinate
save something too much wonder of his eye
which having all all could not satisfy
but poorly rich so wanteth in his store
that cloy'd with much he pineth still for more
but she that never coped with stranger eyes
could pick no meaning from their parling looks
nor read the subtleshining secrecies
writ in the glassy margents of such books
she touch'd no unknown baits nor fear'd no hooks
nor could she moralize his wanton sight
more than his eyes were open'd to the light
he stories to her ears her husband's fame
won in the fields of fruitful italy
and decks with praises collatine's high name
made glorious by his manly chivalry
with bruised arms and wreaths of victory
her joy with heavedup hand she doth express
and wordless so greets heaven for his success
far from the purpose of his coming hither
he makes excuses for his being there
no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
till sable night mother of dread and fear
upon the world dim darkness doth display
and in her vaulty prison stows the day
for then is tarquin brought unto his bed
intending weariness with heavy spright
for after supper long he questioned
with modest lucrece and wore out the night
now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight
and every one to rest themselves betake
save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake
as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving
the sundry dangers of his will's obtaining
yet ever to obtain his will resolving
though weakbuilt hopes persuade him to abstaining
despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining
and when great treasure is the meed proposed
though death be adjunct there's no death supposed
those that much covet are with gain so fond
for what they have not that which they possess
they scatter and unloose it from their bond
and so by hoping more they have but less
or gaining more the profit of excess
is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain
that they prove bankrupt in this poorrich gain
the aim of all is but to nurse the life
with honour wealth and ease in waning age
and in this aim there is such thwarting strife
that one for all or all for one we gage
as life for honour in fell battle's rage
honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost
the death of all and all together lost
so that in venturing ill we leave to be
the things we are for that which we expect
and this ambitious foul infirmity
in having much torments us with defect
of that we have so then we do neglect
the thing we have and all for want of wit
make something nothing by augmenting it
such hazard now must doting tarquin make
pawning his honour to obtain his lust
and for himself himself be must forsake
then where is truth if there be no selftrust
when shall he think to find a stranger just
when he himself himself confounds betrays
to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days
now stole upon the time the dead of night
when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes
no comfortable star did lend his light
no noise but owls and wolves deathboding cries
now serves the season that they may surprise
the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still
while lust and murder wake to stain and kill
and now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed
throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm
is madly toss'd between desire and dread
th one sweetly flatters th other feareth harm
but honest fear bewitch'd with lust's foul charm
doth too too oft betake him to retire
beaten away by brainsick rude desire
his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth
that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly
whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth
which must be lodestar to his lustful eye
and to the flame thus speaks advisedly
'as from this cold flint i enforced this fire
so lucrece must i force to my desire'
here pale with fear he doth premeditate
the dangers of his loathsome enterprise
and in his inward mind he doth debate
what following sorrow may on this arise
then looking scornfully he doth despise
his naked armour of stillslaughter'd lust
and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust
'fair torch burn out thy light and lend it not
to darken her whose light excelleth thine
and die unhallow'd thoughts before you blot
with your uncleanness that which is divine
offer pure incense to so pure a shrine
let fair humanity abhor the deed
that spots and stains love's modest snowwhite weed
'o shame to knighthood and to shining arms
o foul dishonour to my household's grave
o impious act including all foul harms
a martial man to be soft fancy's slave
true valour still a true respect should have
then my digression is so vile so base
that it will live engraven in my face
'yea though i die the scandal will survive
and be an eyesore in my golden coat
some loathsome dash the herald will contrive
to cipher me how fondly i did dote
that my posterity shamed with the note
shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin
to wish that i their father had not bin
'what win i if i gain the thing i seek
a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy
who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week
or sells eternity to get a toy
for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy
or what fond beggar but to touch the crown
would with the sceptre straight be strucken down
'if collatinus dream of my intent
will he not wake and in a desperate rage
post hither this vile purpose to prevent
this siege that hath engirt his marriage
this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage
this dying virtue this surviving shame
whose crime will bear an everduring blame
'o what excuse can my invention make
when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed
will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake
mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed
the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed
and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly
but cowardlike with trembling terror die
'had collatinus kill'd my son or sire
or lain in ambush to betray my life
or were he not my dear friend this desire
might have excuse to work upon his wife
as in revenge or quittal of such strife
but as he is my kinsman my dear friend
the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end
'shameful it is ay if the fact be known
hateful it is there is no hate in loving
i'll beg her love but she is own
the worst is but denial and reproving
my will is strong past reason's weak removing
who fears a sentence or an old man's saw
shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe'
thus graceless holds he disputation
'tween frozen conscience and hotburning will
and with good thoughts make dispensation
urging the worser sense for vantage still
which in a moment doth confound and kill
all pure effects and doth so far proceed
that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed
quoth he she took me kindly by the hand
and gazed for tidings in my eager eyes
fearing some hard news from the warlike band
where her beloved collatinus lies
o how her fear did make her colour rise
first red as roses that on lawn we lay
then white as lawn the roses took away
'and how her hand in my hand being lock'd
forced it to tremble with her loyal fear
which struck her sad and then it faster rock'd
until her husband's welfare she did hear
whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer
that had narcissus seen her as she stood
selflove had never drown'd him in the flood
'why hunt i then for colour or excuses
all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth
poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses
love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth
affection is my captain and he leadeth
and when his gaudy banner is display'd
the coward fights and will not be dismay'd
'then childish fear avaunt debating die
respect and reason wait on wrinkled age
my heart shall never countermand mine eye
sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage
my part is youth and beats these from the stage
desire my pilot is beauty my prize
then who fears sinking where such treasure lies'
as corn o'ergrown by weeds so heedful fear
is almost choked by unresisted lust
away he steals with open listening ear
full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust
both which as servitors to the unjust
so cross him with their opposite persuasion
that now he vows a league and now invasion
within his thought her heavenly image sits
and in the selfsame seat sits collatine
that eye which looks on her confounds his wits
that eye which him beholds as more divine
unto a view so false will not incline
but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart
which once corrupted takes the worser part
and therein heartens up his servile powers
who flatter'd by their leader's jocund show
stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours
and as their captain so their pride doth grow
paying more slavish tribute than they owe
by reprobate desire thus madly led
the roman lord marcheth to lucrece bed
the locks between her chamber and his will
each one by him enforced retires his ward
but as they open they all rate his ill
which drives the creeping thief to some regard
the threshold grates the door to have him heard
nightwandering weasels shriek to see him there
they fright him yet he still pursues his fear
as each unwilling portal yields him way
through little vents and crannies of the place
the wind wars with his torch to make him stay
and blows the smoke of it into his face
extinguishing his conduct in this case
but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch
puffs forth another wind that fires the torch
and being lighted by the light he spies
lucretia's glove wherein her needle sticks
he takes it from the rushes where it lies
and griping it the needle his finger pricks
as who should say this glove to wanton tricks
is not inured return again in haste
thou see'st our mistress ornaments are chaste'
but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him
he in the worst sense construes their denial
the doors the wind the glove that did delay him
he takes for accidental things of trial
or as those bars which stop the hourly dial
who with a lingering slay his course doth let
till every minute pays the hour his debt
'so so quoth he these lets attend the time
like little frosts that sometime threat the spring
to add a more rejoicing to the prime
and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing
pain pays the income of each precious thing
huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands
the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands'
now is he come unto the chamberdoor
that shuts him from the heaven of his thought
which with a yielding latch and with no more
hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought
so from himself impiety hath wrought
that for his prey to pray he doth begin
as if the heavens should countenance his sin
but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer
having solicited th eternal power
that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
and they would stand auspicious to the hour
even there he starts quoth he i must deflower
the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact
how can they then assist me in the act
'then love and fortune be my gods my guide
my will is back'd with resolution
thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried
the blackest sin is clear'd with absolution
against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution
the eye of heaven is out and misty night
covers the shame that follows sweet delight'
this said his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch
and with his knee the door he opens wide
the dove sleeps fast that this nightowl will catch
thus treason works ere traitors be espied
who sees the lurking serpent steps aside
but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing
lies at the mercy of his mortal sting
into the chamber wickedly he stalks
and gazeth on her yet unstained bed
the curtains being close about he walks
rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head
by their high treason is his heart misled
which gives the watchword to his hand full soon
to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon
look as the fair and fierypointed sun
rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight
even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun
to wink being blinded with a greater light
whether it is that she reflects so bright
that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed
but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed
o had they in that darksome prison died
then had they seen the period of their ill
then collatine again by lucrece side
in his clear bed might have reposed still
but they must ope this blessed league to kill
and holythoughted lucrece to their sight
must sell her joy her life her world's delight
her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss
who therefore angry seems to part in sunder
swelling on either side to want his bliss
between whose hills her head entombed is
where like a virtuous monument she lies
to be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes
without the bed her other fair hand was
on the green coverlet whose perfect white
show'd like an april daisy on the grass
with pearly sweat resembling dew of night
her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light
and canopied in darkness sweetly lay
till they might open to adorn the day
her hair like golden threads play'd with her breath
o modest wantons wanton modesty
showing life's triumph in the map of death
and death's dim look in life's mortality
each in her sleep themselves so beautify
as if between them twain there were no strife
but that life lived in death and death in life
her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue
a pair of maiden worlds unconquered
save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew
and him by oath they truly honoured
these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred
who like a foul ursurper went about
from this fair throne to heave the owner out
what could he see but mightily he noted
what did he note but strongly he desired
what he beheld on that he firmly doted
and in his will his wilful eye he tired
with more than admiration he admired
her azure veins her alabaster skin
her coral lips her snowwhite dimpled chin
as the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey
sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied
so o'er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay
his rage of lust by gazing qualified
slack'd not suppress'd for standing by her side
his eye which late this mutiny restrains
unto a greater uproar tempts his veins
and they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting
obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting
in bloody death and ravishment delighting
nor children's tears nor mothers groans respecting
swell in their pride the onset still expecting
anon his beating heart alarum striking
gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking
his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye
his eye commends the leading to his hand
his hand as proud of such a dignity
smoking with pride march'd on to make his stand
on her bare breast the heart of all her land
whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale
left there round turrets destitute and pale
they mustering to the quiet cabinet
where their dear governess and lady lies
do tell her she is dreadfully beset
and fright her with confusion of their cries
she much amazed breaks ope her lock'dup eyes
who peeping forth this tumult to behold
are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd
imagine her as one in dead of night
from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking
that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite
whose grim aspect sets every joint ashaking
what terror or tis but she in worser taking
from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view
the sight which makes supposed terror true
wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears
like to a newkill'd bird she trembling lies
she dares not look yet winking there appears
quickshifting antics ugly in her eyes
such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries
who angry that the eyes fly from their lights
in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights
his hand that yet remains upon her breast
rude ram to batter such an ivory wall
may feel her heartpoor citizendistress'd
wounding itself to death rise up and fall
beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal
this moves in him more rage and lesser pity
to make the breach and enter this sweet city
first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin
to sound a parley to his heartless foe
who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin
the reason of this rash alarm to know
which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show
but she with vehement prayers urgeth still
under what colour he commits this ill
thus he replies the colour in thy face
that even for anger makes the lily pale
and the red rose blush at her own disgrace
shall plead for me and tell my loving tale
under that colour am i come to scale
thy neverconquer'd fort the fault is thine
for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine
'thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide
thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night
where thou with patience must my will abide
my will that marks thee for my earth's delight
which i to conquer sought with all my might
but as reproof and reason beat it dead
by thy bright beauty was it newly bred
'i see what crosses my attempt will bring
i know what thorns the growing rose defends
i think the honey guarded with a sting
all this beforehand counsel comprehends
but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends
only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty
and dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty
'i have debated even in my soul
what wrong what shame what sorrow i shall breed
but nothing can affection's course control
or stop the headlong fury of his speed
i know repentant tears ensue the deed
reproach disdain and deadly enmity
yet strive i to embrace mine infamy'
this said he shakes aloft his roman blade
which like a falcon towering in the skies
coucheth the fowl below with his wings shade
whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies
so under his insulting falchion lies
harmless lucretia marking what he tells
with trembling fear as fowl hear falcon's bells
'lucrece quoth he'this night i must enjoy thee
if thou deny then force must work my way
for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee
that done some worthless slave of thine i'll slay
to kill thine honour with thy life's decay
and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him
swearing i slew him seeing thee embrace him
'so thy surviving husband shall remain
the scornful mark of every open eye
thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain
thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy
and thou the author of their obloquy
shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
and sung by children in succeeding times
'but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend
the fault unknown is as a thought unacted
a little harm done to a great good end
for lawful policy remains enacted
the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
in a pure compound being so applied
his venom in effect is purified
'then for thy husband and thy children's sake
tender my suit bequeath not to their lot
the shame that from them no device can take
the blemish that will never be forgot
worse than a slavish wipe or birthhour's blot
for marks descried in men's nativity
are nature's faults not their own infamy'
here with a cockatrice deadkilling eye
he rouseth up himself and makes a pause
while she the picture of pure piety
like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws
pleads in a wilderness where are no laws
to the rough beast that knows no gentle right
nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
but when a blackfaced cloud the world doth threat
in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding
from earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get
which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding
hindering their present fall by this dividing
so his unhallow'd haste her words delays
and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays
yet foul nightwaking cat he doth but dally
while in his holdfast foot the weak mouse panteth
her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly
a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth
his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth
no penetrable entrance to her plaining
tears harden lust though marble wear with raining
her pitypleading eyes are sadly fix'd
in the remorseless wrinkles of his face
her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd
which to her oratory adds more grace
she puts the period often from his place
and midst the sentence so her accent breaks
that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks
she conjures him by high almighty jove
by knighthood gentry and sweet friendship's oath
by her untimely tears her husband's love
by holy human law and common troth
by heaven and earth and all the power of both
that to his borrow'd bed he make retire
and stoop to honour not to foul desire
quoth she reward not hospitality
with such black payment as thou hast pretended
mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee
mar not the thing that cannot be amended
end thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended
he is no woodman that doth bend his bow
to strike a poor unseasonable doe
'my husband is thy friend for his sake spare me
thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me
myself a weakling do not then ensnare me
thou look'st not like deceit do not deceive me
my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee
if ever man were moved with woman moans
be moved with my tears my sighs my groans
'all which together like a troubled ocean
beat at thy rocky and wreckthreatening heart
to soften it with their continual motion
for stones dissolved to water do convert
o if no harder than a stone thou art
melt at my tears and be compassionate
soft pity enters at an iron gate
'in tarquin's likeness i did entertain thee
hast thou put on his shape to do him shame
to all the host of heaven i complain me
thou wrong'st his honour wound'st his princely name
thou art not what thou seem'st and if the same
thou seem'st not what thou art a god a king
for kings like gods should govern everything
'how will thy shame be seeded in thine age
when thus thy vices bud before thy spring
if in thy hope thou darest do such outrage
what darest thou not when once thou art a king
o be remember'd no outrageous thing
from vassal actors can be wiped away
then kings misdeeds cannot be hid in clay
'this deed will make thee only loved for fear
but happy monarchs still are fear'd for love
with foul offenders thou perforce must bear
when they in thee the like offences prove
if but for fear of this thy will remove
for princes are the glass the school the book
where subjects eyes do learn do read do look
'and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn
must he in thee read lectures of such shame
wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
authority for sin warrant for blame
to privilege dishonour in thy name
thou black'st reproach against longliving laud
and makest fair reputation but a bawd
'hast thou command by him that gave it thee
from a pure heart command thy rebel will
draw not thy sword to guard iniquity
for it was lent thee all that brood to kill
thy princely office how canst thou fulfil
when pattern'd by thy fault foul sin may say
he learn'd to sin and thou didst teach the way
'think but how vile a spectacle it were
to view thy present trespass in another
men's faults do seldom to themselves appear
their own transgressions partially they smother
this guilt would seem deathworthy in thy brother
o how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
that from their own misdeeds askance their eyes
'to thee to thee my heavedup hands appeal
not to seducing lust thy rash relier
i sue for exiled majesty's repeal
let him return and flattering thoughts retire
his true respect will prison false desire
and wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne
that thou shalt see thy state and pity mine'
'have done quoth he my uncontrolled tide
turns not but swells the higher by this let
small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide
and with the wind in greater fury fret
the petty streams that pay a daily debt
to their salt sovereign with their fresh falls haste
add to his flow but alter not his taste'
'thou art quoth she a sea a sovereign king
and lo there falls into thy boundless flood
black lust dishonour shame misgoverning
who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood
if all these pretty ills shall change thy good
thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed
and not the puddle in thy sea dispersed
'so shall these slaves be king and thou their slave
thou nobly base they basely dignified
thou their fair life and they thy fouler grave
thou loathed in their shame they in thy pride
the lesser thing should not the greater hide
the cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot
but low shrubs wither at the cedar's root
'so let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state'
no more quoth he by heaven i will not hear thee
yield to my love if not enforced hate
instead of love's coy touch shall rudely tear thee
that done despitefully i mean to bear thee
unto the base bed of some rascal groom
to be thy partner in this shameful doom'
this said he sets his foot upon the light
for light and lust are deadly enemies
shame folded up in blind concealing night
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
the wolf hath seized his prey the poor lamb cries
till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
entombs her outcry in her lips sweet fold
for with the nightly linen that she wears
he pens her piteous clamours in her head
cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed
o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed
the spots whereof could weeping purify
her tears should drop on them perpetually
but she hath lost a dearer thing than life
and he hath won what he would lose again
this forced league doth force a further strife
this momentary joy breeds months of pain
this hot desire converts to cold disdain
pure chastity is rifled of her store
and lust the thief far poorer than before
look as the fullfed hound or gorged hawk
unapt for tender smell or speedy flight
make slow pursuit or altogether balk
the prey wherein by nature they delight
so surfeittaking tarquin fares this night
his taste delicious in digestion souring
devours his will that lived by foul devouring
o deeper sin than bottomless conceit
can comprehend in still imagination
drunken desire must vomit his receipt
ere he can see his own abomination
while lust is in his pride no exclamation
can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
till like a jade selfwill himself doth tire
and then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek
with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace
feeble desire all recreant poor and meek
like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case
the flesh being proud desire doth fight with grace
for there it revels and when that decays
the guilty rebel for remission prays
so fares it with this faultful lord of rome
who this accomplishment so hotly chased
for now against himself he sounds this doom
that through the length of times he stands disgraced
besides his soul's fair temple is defaced
to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares
to ask the spotted princess how she fares
she says her subjects with foul insurrection
have batter'd down her consecrated wall
and by their mortal fault brought in subjection
her immortality and made her thrall
to living death and pain perpetual
which in her prescience she controlled still
but her foresight could not forestall their will
even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth
a captive victor that hath lost in gain
bearing away the wound that nothing healeth
the scar that will despite of cure remain
leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain
she bears the load of lust he left behind
and he the burden of a guilty mind
he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence
she like a wearied lamb lies panting there
he scowls and hates himself for his offence
she desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear
he faintly flies sneaking with guilty fear
she stays exclaiming on the direful night
he runs and chides his vanish'd loathed delight
he thence departs a heavy convertite
she there remains a hopeless castaway
he in his speed looks for the morning light
she prays she never may behold the day
'for day quoth she nights scapes doth open lay
and my true eyes have never practised how
to cloak offences with a cunning brow
'they think not but that every eye can see
the same disgrace which they themselves behold
and therefore would they still in darkness be
to have their unseen sin remain untold
for they their guilt with weeping will unfold
and grave like water that doth eat in steel
upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel'
here she exclaims against repose and rest
and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind
she wakes her heart by beating on her breast
and bids it leap from thence where it may find
some purer chest to close so pure a mind
frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
against the unseen secrecy of night
'o comfortkilling night image of hell
dim register and notary of shame
black stage for tragedies and murders fell
vast sinconcealing chaos nurse of blame
blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame
grim cave of death whispering conspirator
with closetongued treason and the ravisher
'o hateful vaporous and foggy night
since thou art guilty of my cureless crime
muster thy mists to meet the eastern light
make war against proportion'd course of time
or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
his wonted height yet ere he go to bed
knit poisonous clouds about his golden head
'with rotten damps ravish the morning air
let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick
the life of purity the supreme fair
ere he arrive his weary noontide prick
and let thy misty vapours march so thick
that in their smoky ranks his smother'd light
may set at noon and make perpetual night
'were tarquin night as he is but night's child
the silvershining queen he would distain
her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled
through night's black bosom should not peep again
so should i have copartners in my pain
and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage
as palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage
'where now i have no one to blush with me
to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine
to mask their brows and hide their infamy
but i alone alone must sit and pine
seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine
mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans
poor wasting monuments of lasting moans
'o night thou furnace of foulreeking smoke
let not the jealous day behold that face
which underneath thy black allhiding cloak
immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace
keep still possession of thy gloomy place
that all the faults which in thy reign are made
may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade
'make me not object to the telltale day
the light will show character'd in my brow
the story of sweet chastity's decay
the impious breach of holy wedlock vow
yea the illiterate that know not how
to cipher what is writ in learned books
will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks
'the nurse to still her child will tell my story
and fright her crying babe with tarquin's name
the orator to deck his oratory
will couple my reproach to tarquin's shame
feastfinding minstrels tuning my defame
will tie the hearers to attend each line
how tarquin wronged me i collatine
'let my good name that senseless reputation
for collatine's dear love be kept unspotted
if that be made a theme for disputation
the branches of another root are rotted
and undeserved reproach to him allotted
that is as clear from this attaint of mine
as i ere this was pure to collatine
'o unseen shame invisible disgrace
o unfelt sore crestwounding private scar
reproach is stamp'd in collatinus face
and tarquin's eye may read the mot afar
how he in peace is wounded not in war
alas how many bear such shameful blows
which not themselves but he that gives them knows
'if collatine thine honour lay in me
from me by strong assault it is bereft
my honour lost and i a dronelike bee
have no perfection of my summer left
but robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft
in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept
and suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept
'yet am i guilty of thy honour's wrack
yet for thy honour did i entertain him
coming from thee i could not put him back
for it had been dishonour to disdain him
besides of weariness he did complain him
and talk'd of virtue o unlook'dfor evil
when virtue is profaned in such a devil
'why should the worm intrude the maiden bud
or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests
or toads infect fair founts with venom mud
or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts
or kings be breakers of their own behests
but no perfection is so absolute
that some impurity doth not pollute
'the aged man that coffersup his gold
is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits
and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold
but like stillpining tantalus he sits
and useless barns the harvest of his wits
having no other pleasure of his gain
but torment that it cannot cure his pain
'so then he hath it when he cannot use it
and leaves it to be master'd by his young
who in their pride do presently abuse it
their father was too weak and they too strong
to hold their cursedblessed fortune long
the sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
even in the moment that we call them ours
'unruly blasts wait on the tender spring
unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers
the adder hisses where the sweet birds sing
what virtue breeds iniquity devours
we have no good that we can say is ours
but illannexed opportunity
or kills his life or else his quality
'o opportunity thy guilt is great
'tis thou that executest the traitor's treason
thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get
whoever plots the sin thou point'st the season
'tis thou that spurn'st at right at law at reason
and in thy shady cell where none may spy him
sits sin to seize the souls that wander by him
'thou makest the vestal violate her oath
thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd
thou smother'st honesty thou murder'st troth
thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd
thou plantest scandal and displacest laud
thou ravisher thou traitor thou false thief
thy honey turns to gall thy joy to grief
'thy secret pleasure turns to open shame
thy private feasting to a public fast
thy smoothing titles to a ragged name
thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste
thy violent vanities can never last
how comes it then vile opportunity
being so bad such numbers seek for thee
'when wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend
and bring him where his suit may be obtain'd
when wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end
or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd
give physic to the sick ease to the pain'd
the poor lame blind halt creep cry out for thee
but they ne'er meet with opportunity
'the patient dies while the physician sleeps
the orphan pines while the oppressor feeds
justice is feasting while the widow weeps
advice is sporting while infection breeds
thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds
wrath envy treason rape and murder's rages
thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages
'when truth and virtue have to do with thee
a thousand crosses keep them from thy aid
they buy thy help but sin ne'er gives a fee
he gratis comes and thou art well appaid
as well to hear as grant what he hath said
my collatine would else have come to me
when tarquin did but he was stay'd by thee
guilty thou art of murder and of theft
guilty of perjury and subornation
guilty of treason forgery and shift
guilty of incest that abomination
an accessary by thine inclination
to all sins past and all that are to come
from the creation to the general doom
'misshapen time copesmate of ugly night
swift subtle post carrier of grisly care
eater of youth false slave to false delight
base watch of woes sin's packhorse virtue's snare
thou nursest all and murder'st all that are
o hear me then injurious shifting time
be guilty of my death since of my crime
'why hath thy servant opportunity
betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose
cancell'd my fortunes and enchained me
to endless date of neverending woes
time's office is to fine the hate of foes
to eat up errors by opinion bred
not spend the dowry of a lawful bed
'time's glory is to calm contending kings
to unmask falsehood and bring truth to light
to stamp the seal of time in aged things
to wake the morn and sentinel the night
to wrong the wronger till he render right
to ruinate proud buildings with thy hours
and smear with dust their glittering golden towers
'to fill with wormholes stately monuments
to feed oblivion with decay of things
to blot old books and alter their contents
to pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings
to dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs
to spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel
and turn the giddy round of fortune's wheel
'to show the beldam daughters of her daughter
to make the child a man the man a child
to slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter
to tame the unicorn and lion wild
to mock the subtle in themselves beguiled
to cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops
and waste huge stones with little water drops
'why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage
unless thou couldst return to make amends
one poor retiring minute in an age
would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends
lending him wit that to bad debtors lends
o this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back
i could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack
'thou ceaseless lackey to eternity
with some mischance cross tarquin in his flight
devise extremes beyond extremity
to make him curse this cursed crimeful night
let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright
and the dire thought of his committed evil
shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil
'disturb his hours of rest with restless trances
afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans
let there bechance him pitiful mischances
to make him moan but pity not his moans
stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones
and let mild women to him lose their mildness
wilder to him than tigers in their wildness
'let him have time to tear his curled hair
let him have time against himself to rave
let him have time of time's help to despair
let him have time to live a loathed slave
let him have time a beggar's orts to crave
and time to see one that by alms doth live
disdain to him disdained scraps to give
'let him have time to see his friends his foes
and merry fools to mock at him resort
let him have time to mark how slow time goes
in time of sorrow and how swift and short
his time of folly and his time of sport
and ever let his unrecalling crime
have time to wail th abusing of his time
'o time thou tutor both to good and bad
teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill
at his own shadow let the thief run mad
himself himself seek every hour to kill
such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill
for who so base would such an office have
as slanderous death'sman to so base a slave
'the baser is he coming from a king
to shame his hope with deeds degenerate
the mightier man the mightier is the thing
that makes him honour'd or begets him hate
for greatest scandal waits on greatest state
the moon being clouded presently is miss'd
but little stars may hide them when they list
'the crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire
and unperceived fly with the filth away
but if the like the snowwhite swan desire
the stain upon his silver down will stay
poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day
gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly
but eagles gazed upon with every eye
'out idle words servants to shallow fools
unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators
busy yourselves in skillcontending schools
debate where leisure serves with dull debaters
to trembling clients be you mediators
for me i force not argument a straw
since that my case is past the help of law
'in vain i rail at opportunity
at time at tarquin and uncheerful night
in vain i cavil with mine infamy
in vain i spurn at my confirm'd despite
this helpless smoke of words doth me no right
the remedy indeed to do me good
is to let forth my fouldefiled blood
'poor hand why quiver'st thou at this decree
honour thyself to rid me of this shame
for if i die my honour lives in thee
but if i live thou livest in my defame
since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame
and wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe
kill both thyself and her for yielding so'
this said from her betumbled couch she starteth
to find some desperate instrument of death
but this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
to make more vent for passage of her breath
which thronging through her lips so vanisheth
as smoke from aetna that in air consumes
or that which from discharged cannon fumes
'in vain quoth she i live and seek in vain
some happy mean to end a hapless life
i fear'd by tarquin's falchion to be slain
yet for the selfsame purpose seek a knife
but when i fear'd i was a loyal wife
so am i now o no that cannot be
of that true type hath tarquin rifled me
'o that is gone for which i sought to live
and therefore now i need not fear to die
to clear this spot by death at least i give
a badge of fame to slander's livery
a dying life to living infamy
poor helpless help the treasure stol'n away
to burn the guiltless casket where it lay
'well well dear collatine thou shalt not know
the stained taste of violated troth
i will not wrong thy true affection so
to flatter thee with an infringed oath
this bastard graff shall never come to growth
he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
that thou art doting father of his fruit
'nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought
nor laugh with his companions at thy state
but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
basely with gold but stol'n from forth thy gate
for me i am the mistress of my fate
and with my trespass never will dispense
till life to death acquit my forced offence
'i will not poison thee with my attaint
nor fold my fault in cleanlycoin'd excuses
my sable ground of sin i will not paint
to hide the truth of this false night's abuses
my tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices
as from a mountainspring that feeds a dale
shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale'
by this lamenting philomel had ended
the welltuned warble of her nightly sorrow
and solemn night with slow sad gait descended
to ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow
lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow
but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see
and therefore still in night would cloister'd be
revealing day through every cranny spies
and seems to point her out where she sits weeping
to whom she sobbing speaks o eye of eyes
why pry'st thou through my window leave thy peeping
mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping
brand not my forehead with thy piercing light
for day hath nought to do what's done by night'
thus cavils she with every thing she sees
true grief is fond and testy as a child
who wayward once his mood with nought agrees
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild
continuance tames the one the other wild
like an unpractised swimmer plunging still
with too much labour drowns for want of skill
so she deepdrenched in a sea of care
holds disputation with each thing she views
and to herself all sorrow doth compare
no object but her passion's strength renews
and as one shifts another straight ensues
sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words
sometime tis mad and too much talk affords
the little birds that tune their morning's joy
make her moans mad with their sweet melody
for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy
sad souls are slain in merry company
grief best is pleased with grief's society
true sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
when with like semblance it is sympathized
'tis double death to drown in ken of shore
he ten times pines that pines beholding food
to see the salve doth make the wound ache more
great grief grieves most at that would do it good
deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood
who being stopp'd the bounding banks o'erflows
grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows
'you mockingbirds quoth she your tunes entomb
within your hollowswelling feather'd breasts
and in my hearing be you mute and dumb
my restless discord loves no stops nor rests
a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests
relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears
distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears
'come philomel that sing'st of ravishment
make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair
as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment
so i at each sad strain will strain a tear
and with deep groans the diapason bear
for burdenwise i'll hum on tarquin still
while thou on tereus descant'st better skill
'and whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part
to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i
to imitate thee well against my heart
will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye
who if it wink shall thereon fall and die
these means as frets upon an instrument
shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment
'and for poor bird thou sing'st not in the day
as shaming any eye should thee behold
some dark deep desert seated from the way
that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold
will we find out and there we will unfold
to creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds
since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds'
as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze
wildly determining which way to fly
or one encompass'd with a winding maze
that cannot tread the way out readily
so with herself is she in mutiny
to live or die which of the twain were better
when life is shamed and death reproach's debtor
'to kill myself quoth she alack what were it
but with my body my poor soul's pollution
they that lose half with greater patience bear it
than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion
that mother tries a merciless conclusion
who having two sweet babes when death takes one
will slay the other and be nurse to none
'my body or my soul which was the dearer
when the one pure the other made divine
whose love of either to myself was nearer
when both were kept for heaven and collatine
ay me the bark peel'd from the lofty pine
his leaves will wither and his sap decay
so must my soul her bark being peel'd away
'her house is sack'd her quiet interrupted
her mansion batter'd by the enemy
her sacred temple spotted spoil'd corrupted
grossly engirt with daring infamy
then let it not be call'd impiety
if in this blemish'd fort i make some hole
through which i may convey this troubled soul
'yet die i will not till my collatine
have heard the cause of my untimely death
that he may vow in that sad hour of mine
revenge on him that made me stop my breath
my stained blood to tarquin i'll bequeath
which by him tainted shall for him be spent
and as his due writ in my testament
'my honour i'll bequeath unto the knife
that wounds my body so dishonoured
'tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life
the one will live the other being dead
so of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred
for in my death i murder shameful scorn
my shame so dead mine honour is newborn
'dear lord of that dear jewel i have lost
what legacy shall i bequeath to thee
my resolution love shall be thy boast
by whose example thou revenged mayest be
how tarquin must be used read it in me
myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe
and for my sake serve thou false tarquin so
'this brief abridgement of my will i make
my soul and body to the skies and ground
my resolution husband do thou take
mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound
my shame be his that did my fame confound
and all my fame that lives disbursed be
to those that live and think no shame of me
'thou collatine shalt oversee this will
how was i overseen that thou shalt see it
my blood shall wash the slander of mine ill
my life's foul deed my life's fair end shall free it
faint not faint heart but stoutly say so be it'
yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee
thou dead both die and both shall victors be'
this plot of death when sadly she had laid
and wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes
with untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid
whose swift obedience to her mistress hies
for fleetwing'd duty with thought's feathers flies
poor lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so
as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow
her mistress she doth give demure goodmorrow
with softslow tongue true mark of modesty
and sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow
for why her face wore sorrow's livery
but durst not ask of her audaciously
why her two suns were cloudeclipsed so
nor why her fair cheeks overwash'd with woe
but as the earth doth weep the sun being set
each flower moisten'd like a melting eye
even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
her circled eyne enforced by sympathy
of those fair suns set in her mistress sky
who in a saltwaved ocean quench their light
which makes the maid weep like the dewy night
a pretty while these pretty creatures stand
like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling
one justly weeps the other takes in hand
no cause but company of her drops spilling
their gentle sex to weep are often willing
grieving themselves to guess at others smarts
and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts
for men have marble women waxen minds
and therefore are they form'd as marble will
the weak oppress'd the impression of strange kinds
is form'd in them by force by fraud or skill
then call them not the authors of their ill
no more than wax shall be accounted evil
wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil
their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain
lays open all the little worms that creep
in men as in a roughgrown grove remain
cavekeeping evils that obscurely sleep
through crystal walls each little mote will peep
though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks
poor women's faces are their own fault's books
no man inveigh against the wither'd flower
but chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd
not that devour'd but that which doth devour
is worthy blame o let it not be hild
poor women's faults that they are so fulfill'd
with men's abuses those proud lords to blame
make weakmade women tenants to their shame
the precedent whereof in lucrece view
assail'd by night with circumstances strong
of present death and shame that might ensue
by that her death to do her husband wrong
such danger to resistance did belong
that dying fear through all her body spread
and who cannot abuse a body dead
by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak
to the poor counterfeit of her complaining
'my girl quoth she on what occasion break
those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are
raining
if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining
know gentle wench it small avails my mood
if tears could help mine own would do me good
'but tell me girl when went'and there she stay'd
till after a deep groan'tarquin from hence'
'madam ere i was up replied the maid
'the more to blame my sluggard negligence
yet with the fault i thus far can dispense
myself was stirring ere the break of day
and ere i rose was tarquin gone away
'but lady if your maid may be so bold
she would request to know your heaviness'
'o peace quoth lucrece if it should be told
the repetition cannot make it less
for more it is than i can well express
and that deep torture may be call'd a hell
when more is felt than one hath power to tell
'go get me hither paper ink and pen
yet save that labour for i have them here
what should i say one of my husband's men
bid thou be ready by and by to bear
a letter to my lord my love my dear
bid him with speed prepare to carry it
the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ'
her maid is gone and she prepares to write
first hovering o'er the paper with her quill
conceit and grief an eager combat fight
what wit sets down is blotted straight with will
this is too curiousgood this blunt and ill
much like a press of people at a door
throng her inventions which shall go before
at last she thus begins thou worthy lord
of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee
health to thy person next vouchsafe t afford
if ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see
some present speed to come and visit me
so i commend me from our house in grief
my woes are tedious though my words are brief'
here folds she up the tenor of her woe
her certain sorrow writ uncertainly
by this short schedule collatine may know
her grief but not her grief's true quality
she dares not thereof make discovery
lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse
besides the life and feeling of her passion
she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her
when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
of her disgrace the better so to clear her
from that suspicion which the world might bear her
to shun this blot she would not blot the letter
with words till action might become them better
to see sad sights moves more than hear them told
for then eye interprets to the ear
the heavy motion that it doth behold
when every part a part of woe doth bear
'tis but a part of sorrow that we hear
deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords
and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words
her letter now is seal'd and on it writ
'at ardea to my lord with more than haste'
the post attends and she delivers it
charging the sourfaced groom to hie as fast
as lagging fowls before the northern blast
speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems
extremity still urgeth such extremes
the homely villain court'sies to her low
and blushing on her with a steadfast eye
receives the scroll without or yea or no
and forth with bashful innocence doth hie
but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
imagine every eye beholds their blame
for lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame
when silly groom god wot it was defect
of spirit life and bold audacity
such harmless creatures have a true respect
to talk in deeds while others saucily
promise more speed but do it leisurely
even so this pattern of the wornout age
pawn'd honest looks but laid no words to gage
his kindled duty kindled her mistrust
that two red fires in both their faces blazed
she thought he blush'd as knowing tarquin's lust
and blushing with him wistly on him gazed
her earnest eye did make him more amazed
the more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish
the more she thought he spied in her some blemish
but long she thinks till he return again
and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone
the weary time she cannot entertain
for now tis stale to sigh to weep and groan
so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan
that she her plaints a little while doth stay
pausing for means to mourn some newer way
at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
of skilful painting made for priam's troy
before the which is drawn the power of greece
for helen's rape the city to destroy
threatening cloudkissing ilion with annoy
which the conceited painter drew so proud
as heaven it seem'd to kiss the turrets bow'd
a thousand lamentable objects there
in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life
many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear
shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife
the red blood reek'd to show the painter's strife
and dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights
like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights
there might you see the labouring pioner
begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust
and from the towers of troy there would appear
the very eyes of men through loopholes thrust
gazing upon the greeks with little lust
such sweet observance in this work was had
that one might see those faroff eyes look sad
in great commanders grace and majesty
you might behold triumphing in their faces
in youth quick bearing and dexterity
pale cowards marching on with trembling paces
which heartless peasants did so well resemble
that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble
in ajax and ulysses o what art
of physiognomy might one behold
the face of either cipher'd either's heart
their face their manners most expressly told
in ajax eyes blunt rage and rigor roll'd
but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent
show'd deep regard and smiling government
there pleading might you see grave nestor stand
as twere encouraging the greeks to fight
making such sober action with his hand
that it beguiled attention charm'd the sight
in speech it seem'd his beard all silver white
wagg'd up and down and from his lips did fly
thin winding breath which purl'd up to the sky
about him were a press of gaping faces
which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice
all jointly listening but with several graces
as if some mermaid did their ears entice
some high some low the painter was so nice
the scalps of many almost hid behind
to jump up higher seem'd to mock the mind
here one man's hand lean'd on another's head
his nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear
here one being throng'd bears back all boll'n and
red
another smother'd seems to pelt and swear
and in their rage such signs of rage they bear
as but for loss of nestor's golden words
it seem'd they would debate with angry swords
for much imaginary work was there
conceit deceitful so compact so kind
that for achilles image stood his spear
griped in an armed hand himself behind
was left unseen save to the eye of mind
a hand a foot a face a leg a head
stood for the whole to be imagined
and from the walls of strongbesieged troy
when their brave hope bold hector march'd to
field
stood many trojan mothers sharing joy
to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield
and to their hope they such odd action yield
that through their light joy seemed to appear
like bright things stain'd a kind of heavy fear
and from the strand of dardan where they fought
to simois reedy banks the red blood ran
whose waves to imitate the battle sought
with swelling ridges and their ranks began
to break upon the galled shore and than
retire again till meeting greater ranks
they join and shoot their foam at simois banks
to this wellpainted piece is lucrece come
to find a face where all distress is stell'd
many she sees where cares have carved some
but none where all distress and dolour dwell'd
till she despairing hecuba beheld
staring on priam's wounds with her old eyes
which bleeding under pyrrhus proud foot lies
in her the painter had anatomized
time's ruin beauty's wreck and grim care's reign
her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised
of what she was no semblance did remain
her blue blood changed to black in every vein
wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed
show'd life imprison'd in a body dead
on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes
and shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes
who nothing wants to answer her but cries
and bitter words to ban her cruel foes
the painter was no god to lend her those
and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong
to give her so much grief and not a tongue
'poor instrument quoth she'without a sound
i'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue
and drop sweet balm in priam's painted wound
and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong
and with my tears quench troy that burns so long
and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
of all the greeks that are thine enemies
'show me the strumpet that began this stir
that with my nails her beauty i may tear
thy heat of lust fond paris did incur
this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear
thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here
and here in troy for trespass of thine eye
the sire the son the dame and daughter die
'why should the private pleasure of some one
become the public plague of many moe
let sin alone committed light alone
upon his head that hath transgressed so
let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe
for one's offence why should so many fall
to plague a private sin in general
'lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies
here manly hector faints here troilus swounds
here friend by friend in bloody channel lies
and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds
and one man's lust these many lives confounds
had doting priam cheque'd his son's desire
troy had been bright with fame and not with fire'
here feelingly she weeps troy's painted woes
for sorrow like a heavyhanging bell
once set on ringing with his own weight goes
then little strength rings out the doleful knell
so lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell
to pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow
she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow
she throws her eyes about the painting round
and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament
at last she sees a wretched image bound
that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent
his face though full of cares yet show'd content
onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes
so mild that patience seem'd to scorn his woes
in him the painter labour'd with his skill
to hide deceit and give the harmless show
an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still
a brow unbent that seem'd to welcome woe
cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
that blushing red no guilty instance gave
nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have
but like a constant and confirmed devil
he entertain'd a show so seeming just
and therein so ensconced his secret evil
that jealousy itself could not mistrust
falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust
into so bright a day such blackfaced storms
or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms
the wellskill'd workman this mild image drew
for perjured sinon whose enchanting story
the credulous old priam after slew
whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
of richbuilt ilion that the skies were sorry
and little stars shot from their fixed places
when their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces
this picture she advisedly perused
and chid the painter for his wondrous skill
saying some shape in sinon's was abused
so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill
and still on him she gazed and gazing still
such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
that she concludes the picture was belied
'it cannot be quoth she'that so much guile'
she would have said can lurk in such a look'
but tarquin's shape came in her mind the while
and from her tongue can lurk from cannot took
'it cannot be she in that sense forsook
and turn'd it thus it cannot be i find
but such a face should bear a wicked mind
'for even as subtle sinon here is painted
so sobersad so weary and so mild
as if with grief or travail he had fainted
to me came tarquin armed so beguiled
with outward honesty but yet defiled
with inward vice as priam him did cherish
so did i tarquin so my troy did perish
'look look how listening priam wets his eyes
to see those borrow'd tears that sinon sheds
priam why art thou old and yet not wise
for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds
his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds
those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity
are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city
'such devils steal effects from lightless hell
for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold
and in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell
these contraries such unity do hold
only to flatter fools and make them bold
so priam's trust false sinon's tears doth flatter
that he finds means to burn his troy with water'
here all enraged such passion her assails
that patience is quite beaten from her breast
she tears the senseless sinon with her nails
comparing him to that unhappy guest
whose deed hath made herself herself detest
at last she smilingly with this gives o'er
'fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore'
thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow
and time doth weary time with her complaining
she looks for night and then she longs for morrow
and both she thinks too long with her remaining
short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining
though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps
and they that watch see time how slow it creeps
which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought
that she with painted images hath spent
being from the feeling of her own grief brought
by deep surmise of others detriment
losing her woes in shows of discontent
it easeth some though none it ever cured
to think their dolour others have endured
but now the mindful messenger come back
brings home his lord and other company
who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black
and round about her tearstained eye
blue circles stream'd like rainbows in the sky
these watergalls in her dim element
foretell new storms to those already spent
which when her sadbeholding husband saw
amazedly in her sad face he stares
her eyes though sod in tears look'd red and raw
her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares
he hath no power to ask her how she fares
both stood like old acquaintance in a trance
met far from home wondering each other's chance
at last he takes her by the bloodless hand
and thus begins what uncouth ill event
hath thee befall'n that thou dost trembling stand
sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent
why art thou thus attired in discontent
unmask dear dear this moody heaviness
and tell thy grief that we may give redress'
three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire
ere once she can discharge one word of woe
at length address'd to answer his desire
she modestly prepares to let them know
her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe
while collatine and his consorted lords
with sad attention long to hear her words
and now this pale swan in her watery nest
begins the sad dirge of her certain ending
'few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best
where no excuse can give the fault amending
in me moe woes than words are now depending
and my laments would be drawn out too long
to tell them all with one poor tired tongue
'then be this all the task it hath to say
dear husband in the interest of thy bed
a stranger came and on that pillow lay
where thou was wont to rest thy weary head
and what wrong else may be imagined
by foul enforcement might be done to me
from that alas thy lucrece is not free
'for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight
with shining falchion in my chamber came
a creeping creature with a flaming light
and softly cried awake thou roman dame
and entertain my love else lasting shame
on thee and thine this night i will inflict
if thou my love's desire do contradict
 for some hardfavour'd groom of thine quoth he
'unless thou yoke thy liking to my will
i'll murder straight and then i'll slaughter thee
and swear i found you where you did fulfil
the loathsome act of lust and so did kill
the lechers in their deed this act will be
my fame and thy perpetual infamy'
'with this i did begin to start and cry
and then against my heart he sets his sword
swearing unless i took all patiently
i should not live to speak another word
so should my shame still rest upon record
and never be forgot in mighty rome
th adulterate death of lucrece and her groom
'mine enemy was strong my poor self weak
and far the weaker with so strong a fear
my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak
no rightful plea might plead for justice there
his scarlet lust came evidence to swear
that my poor beauty had purloin'd his eyes
and when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies
'o teach me how to make mine own excuse
or at the least this refuge let me find
though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse
immaculate and spotless is my mind
that was not forced that never was inclined
to accessary yieldings but still pure
doth in her poison'd closet yet endure'
lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss
with head declined and voice damm'd up with woe
with sad set eyes and wretched arms across
from lips newwaxen pale begins to blow
the grief away that stops his answer so
but wretched as he is he strives in vain
what he breathes out his breath drinks up again
as through an arch the violent roaring tide
outruns the eye that doth behold his haste
yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
back to the strait that forced him on so fast
in rage sent out recall'd in rage being past
even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw
to push grief on and back the same grief draw
which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth
and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh
'dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
another power no flood by raining slaketh
my woe too sensible thy passion maketh
more feelingpainful let it then suffice
to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes
'and for my sake when i might charm thee so
for she that was thy lucrece now attend me
be suddenly revenged on my foe
thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me
from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me
comes all too late yet let the traitor die
for sparing justice feeds iniquity
'but ere i name him you fair lords quoth she
speaking to those that came with collatine
'shall plight your honourable faiths to me
with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine
for tis a meritorious fair design
to chase injustice with revengeful arms
knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms'
at this request with noble disposition
each present lord began to promise aid
as bound in knighthood to her imposition
longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd
but she that yet her sad task hath not said
the protestation stops o speak  quoth she
'how may this forced stain be wiped from me
'what is the quality of mine offence
being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance
may my pure mind with the foul act dispense
my lowdeclined honour to advance
may any terms acquit me from this chance
the poison'd fountain clears itself again
and why not i from this compelled stain'
with this they all at once began to say
her body's stain her mind untainted clears
while with a joyless smile she turns away
the face that map which deep impression bears
of hard misfortune carved in it with tears
'no no quoth she no dame hereafter living
by my excuse shall claim excuse's giving'
here with a sigh as if her heart would break
she throws forth tarquin's name he he she says
but more than he her poor tongue could not speak
till after many accents and delays
untimely breathings sick and short assays
she utters this he he fair lords tis he
that guides this hand to give this wound to me'
even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed
that blow did that it from the deep unrest
of that polluted prison where it breathed
her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly
life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny
stonestill astonish'd with this deadly deed
stood collatine and all his lordly crew
till lucrece father that beholds her bleed
himself on her selfslaughter'd body threw
and from the purple fountain brutus drew
the murderous knife and as it left the place
her blood in poor revenge held it in chase
and bubbling from her breast it doth divide
in two slow rivers that the crimson blood
circles her body in on every side
who like a latesack'd island vastly stood
bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood
some of her blood still pure and red remain'd
and some look'd black and that false tarquin stain'd
about the mourning and congealed face
of that black blood a watery rigol goes
which seems to weep upon the tainted place
and ever since as pitying lucrece woes
corrupted blood some watery token shows
and blood untainted still doth red abide
blushing at that which is so putrified
'daughter dear daughter old lucretius cries
'that life was mine which thou hast here deprived
if in the child the father's image lies
where shall i live now lucrece is unlived
thou wast not to this end from me derived
if children predecease progenitors
we are their offspring and they none of ours
'poor broken glass i often did behold
in thy sweet semblance my old age new born
but now that fresh fair mirror dim and old
shows me a bareboned death by time outworn
o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn
and shivered all the beauty of my glass
that i no more can see what once i was
'o time cease thou thy course and last no longer
if they surcease to be that should survive
shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
and leave the faltering feeble souls alive
the old bees die the young possess their hive
then live sweet lucrece live again and see
thy father die and not thy father thee
by this starts collatine as from a dream
and bids lucretius give his sorrow place
and then in keycold lucrece bleeding stream
he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face
and counterfeits to die with her a space
till manly shame bids him possess his breath
and live to be revenged on her death
the deep vexation of his inward soul
hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue
who mad that sorrow should his use control
or keep him from hearteasing words so long
begins to talk but through his lips do throng
weak words so thick come in his poor heart's aid
that no man could distinguish what he said
yet sometime tarquin was pronounced plain
but through his teeth as if the name he tore
this windy tempest till it blow up rain
held back his sorrow's tide to make it more
at last it rains and busy winds give o'er
then son and father weep with equal strife
who should weep most for daughter or for wife
the one doth call her his the other his
yet neither may possess the claim they lay
the father says she's mine o mine she is'
replies her husband do not take away
my sorrow's interest let no mourner say
he weeps for her for she was only mine
and only must be wail'd by collatine'
'o quoth lucretius i did give that life
which she too early and too late hath spill'd'
'woe woe quoth collatine she was my wife
i owed her and tis mine that she hath kill'd'
'my daughter and my wife with clamours fill'd
the dispersed air who holding lucrece life
answer'd their cries my daughter and my wife'
brutus who pluck'd the knife from lucrece side
seeing such emulation in their woe
began to clothe his wit in state and pride
burying in lucrece wound his folly's show
he with the romans was esteemed so
as sillyjeering idiots are with kings
for sportive words and uttering foolish things
but now he throws that shallow habit by
wherein deep policy did him disguise
and arm'd his longhid wits advisedly
to cheque the tears in collatinus eyes
'thou wronged lord of rome quoth be arise
let my unsounded self supposed a fool
now set thy longexperienced wit to school
'why collatine is woe the cure for woe
do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds
is it revenge to give thyself a blow
for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
such childish humour from weak minds proceeds
thy wretched wife mistook the matter so
to slay herself that should have slain her foe
'courageous roman do not steep thy heart
in such relenting dew of lamentations
but kneel with me and help to bear thy part
to rouse our roman gods with invocations
that they will suffer these abominations
since rome herself in them doth stand disgraced
by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased
'now by the capitol that we adore
and by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd
by heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's
store
by all our country rights in rome maintain'd
and by chaste lucrece soul that late complain'd
her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife
we will revenge the death of this true wife'
this said he struck his hand upon his breast
and kiss'd the fatal knife to end his vow
and to his protestation urged the rest
who wondering at him did his words allow
then jointly to the ground their knees they bow
and that deep vow which brutus made before
he doth again repeat and that they swore
when they had sworn to this advised doom
they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence
to show her bleeding body thorough rome
and so to publish tarquin's foul offence
which being done with speedy diligence
the romans plausibly did give consent
to tarquin's everlasting banishment
 sonnets

our everliving poet wisheth

setting forth
t t
i
from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beauty's rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feed'st thy light'st flame with selfsubstantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
and only herald to the gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl makest waste in niggarding
 pity the world or else this glutton be
 to eat the world's due by the grave and thee
ii
when forty winters shall beseige thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held
then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deepsunken eyes
were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse'
proving his beauty by succession thine
 this were to be new made when thou art old
 and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold
iii
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his selflove to stop posterity
thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shall see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
 but if thou live remember'd not to be
 die single and thine image dies with thee
iv
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thyself thy beauty's legacy
nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thyself alone
thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
 thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee
 which used lives th executor to be
v
those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for neverresting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where
then were not summer's distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beauty's effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
 but flowers distill'd though they with winter meet
 leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
vi
then let not winter's ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distill'd
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
with beauty's treasure ere it be selfkill'd
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
that's for thyself to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thyself were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
 be not selfwill'd for thou art much too fair
 to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir
vii
lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his newappearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climb'd the steepup heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
 so thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
 unlook'd on diest unless thou get a son
viii
music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly
or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of welltuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
 whose speechless song being many seeming one
 sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none'
ix
is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
that thou consumest thyself in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by children's eyes her husband's shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beauty's waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
 no love toward others in that bosom sits
 that on himself such murderous shame commits
x
for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
who for thyself art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lovest is most evident
for thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
that gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thyself at least kindhearted prove
 make thee another self for love of me
 that beauty still may live in thine or thee
xi
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endow'd she gave the more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
 she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
 thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
xii
when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silver'd o'er with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer's green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
 and nothing gainst time's scythe can make defence
 save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
xiii
o that you were yourself but love you are
no longer yours than you yourself here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
yourself again after yourself's decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winter's day
and barren rage of death's eternal cold
 o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
 you had a father let your son say so
xiv
not from the stars do i my judgment pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
 or else of thee this i prognosticate
 thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date
xv
when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and cheque'd even by the selfsame sky
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
 and all in war with time for love of you
 as he takes from you i engraft you new
xvi
but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify yourself in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear your living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live yourself in eyes of men
 to give away yourself keeps yourself still
 and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
xvii
who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were fill'd with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces'
so should my papers yellow'd with their age
be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
 but were some child of yours alive that time
 you should live twice in it and in my rhyme
xviii
shall i compare thee to a summer's day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer's lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimm'd
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growest
 so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
 so long lives this and this gives life to thee
xix
devouring time blunt thou the lion's paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
and do whate'er thou wilt swiftfooted time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beauty's pattern to succeeding men
 yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
 my love shall in my verse ever live young
xx
a woman's face with nature's own hand painted
hast thou the mastermistress of my passion
a woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false women's fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
 but since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure
 mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure
xxi
so is it not with me as with that muse
stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven itself for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems
with april's firstborn flowers and all things rare
that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mother's child though not so bright
as those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air
 let them say more than like of hearsay well
 i will not praise that purpose not to sell
xxii
my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee time's furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for myself but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
 presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
 thou gavest me thine not to give back again
xxiii
as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put besides his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
the perfect ceremony of love's rite
and in mine own love's strength seem to decay
o'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might
o let my books be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more express'd
 o learn to read what silent love hath writ
 to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit
xxiv
mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
thy beauty's form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein tis held
and perspective it is the painter's art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosom's shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
 yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
 they draw but what they see know not the heart
xxv
let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlook'd for joy in that i honour most
great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the sun's eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foil'd
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toil'd
 then happy i that love and am beloved
 where i may not remove nor be removed
xxvi
lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tatter'd loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
 then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
 till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
xxvii
weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear repose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when body's work's expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my soul's imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
 lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
 for thee and for myself no quiet find
xxviii
how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarr'd the benefit of rest
when day's oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppress'd
and each though enemies to either's reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please them thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swartcomplexion'd night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
 and night doth nightly make grief's strength
 seem stronger
xxix
when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possess'd
desiring this man's art and that man's scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate
 for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
 that then i scorn to change my state with kings
xxx
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night
and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe
and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
the sad account of forebemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
 but if the while i think on thee dear friend
 all losses are restored and sorrows end
xxxi
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all love's loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
 their images i loved i view in thee
 and thou all they hast all the all of me
xxxii
if thou survive my wellcontented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more resurvey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
compare them with the bettering of the time
and though they be outstripp'd by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
 but since he died and poets better prove
 theirs for their style i'll read his for his love'
xxxiii
full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendor on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now
 yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
 suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth
xxxiv
why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
the offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offence's cross
 ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
 and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
xxxv
no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
myself corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and gainst myself a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
 that i an accessary needs must be
 to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
xxxvi
let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not love's sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honour me
unless thou take that honour from thy name
 but do not so i love thee in such sort
 as thou being mine mine is thy good report
xxxvii
as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortune's dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
 look what is best that best i wish in thee
 this wish i have then ten times happy me
xxxviii
how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thyself the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thyself dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
 if my slight muse do please these curious days
 the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
xxxix
o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is t but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deservest alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
 and that thou teachest how to make one twain
 by praising him here who doth hence remain
xl
take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
by wilful taste of what thyself refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear love's wrong than hate's known injury
 lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
 kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
xli
those petty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what woman's son
will sourly leave her till she have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear
and chide try beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
 hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
 thine by thy beauty being false to me
xlii
that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my love's gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
 but here's the joy my friend and i are one
 sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
xliii
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadow's form form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
 all days are nights to see till i see thee
 and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
xliv
if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend time's leisure with my moan
 receiving nought by elements so slow
 but heavy tears badges of either's woe
xlv
the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these presentabsent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppress'd with melancholy
until life's composition be recured
by those swift messengers return'd from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
 this told i joy but then no longer glad
 i send them back again and straight grow sad
xlvi
mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to cide this title is impanneled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part
 as thus mine eye's due is thy outward part
 and my heart's right thy inward love of heart
xlvii
betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famish'd for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my love's picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my heart's guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thyself away art resent still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
 or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
 awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight
xlviii
how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not lock'd up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
 and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear
 for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
xlix
against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
call'd to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against myself uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
 to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
 since why to love i can allege no cause
l
how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travel's end
doth teach that ease and that repose to say
'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend'
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
 for that same groan doth put this in my mind
 my grief lies onward and my joy behind
li
thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
 since from thee going he went wilfulslow
 towards thee i'll run and give him leave to go
lii
so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in the long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprison'd pride
 blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
 being had to triumph being lack'd to hope
liii
what is your substance whereof are you made
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
is poorly imitated after you
on helen's cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
and you in every blessed shape we know
 in all external grace you have some part
 but you like none none you for constant heart
liv
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the cankerblooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summer's breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwoo'd and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
 and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
 when that shall fade my verse distills your truth
lv
not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
'gainst death and alloblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
 so till the judgment that yourself arise
 you live in this and dwell in lover's eyes
lvi
sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but today by feeding is allay'd
tomorrow sharpen'd in his former might
so love be thou although today thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness
tomorrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
 else call it winter which being full of care
 makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd more rare
lvii
being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
 so true a fool is love that in your will
 though you do any thing he thinks no ill
lviii
that god forbid that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand the account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
the imprison'd absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each cheque
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you yourself may privilege your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime
 i am to wait though waiting so be hell
 not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
lix
if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amiss
the second burden of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
 o sure i am the wits of former days
 to subjects worse have given admiring praise
lx
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd
crooked elipses gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beauty's brow
feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
 and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
 praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
lxi
is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenor of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
 for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
 from me far off with others all too near
lxii
sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for myself mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me myself indeed
beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity
mine own selflove quite contrary i read
self so selfloving were iniquity
 tis thee myself that for myself i praise
 painting my age with beauty of thy days
lxiii
against my love shall be as i am now
with time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn
when hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travell'd on to age's steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now he's king
are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age's cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love's beauty though my lover's life
 his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
 and they shall live and he in them still green
lxiv
when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see downrazed
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state itself confounded to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
that time will come and take my love away
 this thought is as a death which cannot choose
 but weep to have that which it fears to lose
lxv
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summer's honey breath hold out
against the wreckful siege of battering days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
 o none unless this miracle have might
 that in black ink my love may still shine bright
lxvi
tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and guilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tonguetied by authority
and folly doctorlike controlling skill
and simple truth miscall'd simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
 tired with all these from these would i be gone
 save that to die i leave my love alone
lxvii
ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace itself with his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeing of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
 o him she stores to show what wealth she had
 in days long since before these last so bad
lxviii
thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before the bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament itself and true
making no summer of another's green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
 and him as for a map doth nature store
 to show false art what beauty was of yore
lxix
those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
 but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
 the solve is this that thou dost common grow
lxx
that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slander's mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being woo'd of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou present'st a pure unstained prime
thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days
either not assail'd or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
 if some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show
 then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
lxxi
no longer mourn for me when i am dead
then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
 lest the wise world should look into your moan
 and mock you with me after i am gone
lxxii
o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
 for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
 and so should you to love things nothing worth
lxxiii
that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
death's second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the deathbed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourish'd by
 this thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong
 to love that well which thou must leave ere long
lxxiv
but be contented when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
the coward conquest of a wretch's knife
too base of thee to be remembered
 the worth of that is that which it contains
 and that is this and this with thee remains
lxxv
so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweetseason'd showers are to the ground
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best to be with you alone
then better'd that the world may see my pleasure
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
 thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
 or gluttoning on all or all away
lxxvi
why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to newfound methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
 for as the sun is daily new and old
 so is my love still telling what is told
lxxvii
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
the vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
time's thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory can not contain
commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
those children nursed deliver'd from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
 these offices so oft as thou wilt look
 shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
lxxviii
so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learned's wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
in others works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
 but thou art all my art and dost advance
 as high as learning my rude ignorance
lxxix
whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decay'd
and my sick muse doth give another place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behavior beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
 then thank him not for that which he doth say
 since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
lxxx
o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
but since your worth wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or being wreck'd i am a worthless boat
he of tall building and of goodly pride
 then if he thrive and i be cast away
 the worst was this my love was my decay
lxxxi
or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
though i once gone to all the world must die
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'erread
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
 you still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen
 where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
lxxxii
i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy truetelling friend
 and their gross painting might be better used
 where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
lxxxiii
i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found or thought i found you did exceed
the barren tender of a poet's debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you yourself being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life and bring a tomb
 there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
 than both your poets can in praise devise
lxxxiv
who is it that says most which can say more
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
 you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
 being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
lxxxv
my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words
and like unletter'd clerk still cry amen'
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polish'd form of wellrefined pen
hearing you praised i say 'tis so tis true'
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
 then others for the breath of words respect
 me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
lxxxvi
was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
 but when your countenance fill'd up his line
 then lack'd i matter that enfeebled mine
lxxxvii
farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgment making
 thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
 in sleep a king but waking no such matter
lxxxviii
when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side against myself i'll fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults conceal'd wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to myself i do
doing thee vantage doublevantage me
 such is my love to thee i so belong
 that for thy right myself will bear all wrong
lxxxix
say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as i'll myself disgrace knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wrong
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
 for thee against myself i'll vow debate
 for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
xc
then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an afterloss
ah do not when my heart hath scoped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortune's might
 and other strains of woe which now seem woe
 compared with loss of thee will not seem so
xci
some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their bodies force
some in their garments though newfangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments cost
of more delight than hawks or horses be
and having thee of all men's pride i boast
 wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
 all this away and me most wretched make
xcii
but do thy worst to steal thyself away
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
happy to have thy love happy to die
 but what's so blessedfair that fears no blot
 thou mayst be false and yet i know it not
xciii
so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so love's face
may still seem love to me though alter'd new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in many's looks the false heart's history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
 how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
 if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
xciv
they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heaven's graces
and husband nature's riches from expense
they are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
though to itself it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
 for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
 lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
xcv
how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
and all things turn to fair that eyes can see
 take heed dear heart of this large privilege
 the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge
xcvi
some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou makest faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteem'd
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deem'd
how many lambs might the stem wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
 but do not so i love thee in such sort
 as thou being mine mine is thy good report
xcvii
how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old december's bareness every where
and yet this time removed was summer's time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widow'd wombs after their lords decease
yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
but hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
 or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
 that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near
xcviii
from you have i been absent in the spring
when proudpied april dress'd in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summer's story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
nor did i wonder at the lily's white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet but figures of delight
drawn after you you pattern of all those
 yet seem'd it winter still and you away
 as with your shadow i with these did play
xcix
the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my love's breath the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stol'n of both
and to his robbery had annex'd thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
 more flowers i noted yet i none could see
 but sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee
c
where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any be a satire to decay
and make time's spoils despised every where
 give my love fame faster than time wastes life
 so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife
ci
o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
'truth needs no colour with his colour fix'd
beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay
but best is best if never intermix'd'
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
 then do thy office muse i teach thee how
 to make him seem long hence as he shows now
cii
my love is strengthen'd though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owner's tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summer's front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
 therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
 because i would not dull you with my song
ciii
alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face
that overgoes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
 and more much more than in my verse can sit
 your own glass shows you when you look in it
civ
to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
 for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
 ere you were born was beauty's summer dead
cv
let not my love be call'd idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love today tomorrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
'fair kind and true is all my argument
'fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
 fair kind and true have often lived alone
 which three till now never kept seat in one
cvi
when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have express'd
even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they look'd but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
 for we which now behold these present days
 had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
cvii
not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
 and thou in this shalt find thy monument
 when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
cviii
what's in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
what's new to speak what new to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say o'er the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine
even as when first i hallow'd thy fair name
so that eternal love in love's fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
 finding the first conceit of love there bred
 where time and outward form would show it dead
cix
o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seem'd my flame to qualify
as easy might i from myself depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
that is my home of love if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that myself bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reign'd
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stain'd
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
 for nothing this wide universe i call
 save thou my rose in it thou art my all
cx
alas tis true i have gone here and there
and made myself a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have look'd on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done have what shall have no end
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
 then give me welcome next my heaven the best
 even to thy pure and most most loving breast
cxi
o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyer's hand
pity me then and wish i were renew'd
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
 pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
 even that your pity is enough to cure me
cxii
your love and pity doth the impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you o'ergreen my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others voices that my adder's sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
 you are so strongly in my purpose bred
 that all the world besides methinks are dead
cxiii
since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rudest or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
 incapable of more replete with you
 my most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue
cxiv
or whether doth my mind being crown'd with you
drink up the monarch's plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
o'tis the first tis flattery in my seeing
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
 if it be poison'd tis the lesser sin
 that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
cxv
those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose million'd accidents
creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
divert strong minds to the course of altering things
alas why fearing of time's tyranny
might i not then say now i love you best'
when i was certain o'er incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
 love is a babe then might i not say so
 to give full growth to that which still doth grow
cxvi
let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an everfixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
 if this be error and upon me proved
 i never writ nor no man ever loved
cxvii
accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dearpurchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your waken'd hate
 since my appeal says i did strive to prove
 the constancy and virtue of your love
cxviii
like as to make our appetites more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being tuff of your ne'ercloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love to anticipate
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
 but thence i learn and find the lesson true
 drugs poison him that so fell sick of you
cxix
what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw myself to win
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruin'd love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
 so i return rebuked to my content
 and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
cxx
that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours you've pass'd a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have remember'd
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you as you to me then tender'd
the humble slave which wounded bosoms fits
 but that your trespass now becomes a fee
 mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
cxxi
'tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
not by our feeling but by others seeing
for why should others false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
 unless this general evil they maintain
 all men are bad and in their badness reign
cxxii
thy gift thy tables are within my brain
full character'd with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be miss'd
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
 to keep an adjunct to remember thee
 were to import forgetfulness in me
cxxiii
no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wondering at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
 this i do vow and this shall ever be
 i will be true despite thy scythe and thee
cxxiv
if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortune's bastard be unfather'd'
as subject to time's love or to time's hate
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gather'd
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto the inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of shortnumber'd hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
 to this i witness call the fools of time
 which die for goodness who have lived for crime
cxxv
were t aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honouring
or laid great bases for eternity
which prove more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mix'd with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
 hence thou suborn'd informer a true soul
 when most impeach'd stands least in thy control
cxxvi
o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass his sickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
 her audit though delay'd answer'd must be
 and her quietus is to render thee
cxxvii
in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beauty's name
but now is black beauty's successive heir
and beauty slander'd with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on nature's power
fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress brows are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
 yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
 that every tongue says beauty should look so
cxxviii
how oft when thou my music music play'st
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
 since saucy jacks so happy are in this
 give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
cxxix
the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallow'd bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
 all this the world well knows yet none knows well
 to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
cxxx
my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damask'd red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
 and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
 as any she belied with false compare
cxxxi
thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
to say they err i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to myself alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on another's neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment's place
 in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
 and thence this slander as i think proceeds
cxxxii
thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
 then will i swear beauty herself is black
 and all they foul that thy complexion lack
cxxxiii
beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
is't not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engross'd
of him myself and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd
prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward
but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail
whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
 and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
 perforce am thine and all that is in me
cxxxiv
so now i have confess'd that he is thine
and i myself am mortgaged to thy will
myself i'll forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learn'd but suretylike to write for me
under that bond that him as fast doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
 him have i lost thou hast both him and me
 he pays the whole and yet am i not free
cxxxv
whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will'
and will to boot and will in overplus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will'
one will of mine to make thy large will more
 let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
 think all but one and me in that one will'
cxxxvi
if thy soul cheque thee that i come so near
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will'
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil
'will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
in things of great receipt with ease we prove
among a number one is reckon'd none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy stores account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
 make but my name thy love and love that still
 and then thou lovest me for my name is will'
cxxxvii
thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide world's common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
 in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
 and to this false plague are they now transferr'd
cxxxviii
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutor'd youth
unlearned in the world's false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love loves not to have years told
 therefore i lie with her and she with me
 and in our faults by lies we flatter'd be
cxxxix
o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my o'erpress'd defense can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
 yet do not so but since i am near slain
 kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
cxl
be wise as thou art cruel do not press
my tonguetied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pitywanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this illwresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
 that i may not be so nor thou belied
 bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
cxli
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man
thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
 only my plague thus far i count my gain
 that she that makes me sin awards me pain
cxlii
love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine
robb'd others beds revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lovest those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
 if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
 by selfexample mayst thou be denied
cxliii
lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
one of her feather'd creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infant's discontent
so runn'st thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mother's part kiss me be kind
 so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will'
 if thou turn back and my loud crying still
cxliv
two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
suspect i may but not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another's hell
 yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt
 till my bad angel fire my good one out
cxlv
those lips that love's own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said i hate'
to me that languish'd for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom
and taught it thus anew to greet
'i hate she alter'd with an end
that follow'd it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
 i hate from hate away she threw
 and saved my life saying not you'
cxlvi
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
 these rebel powers that thee array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed without be rich no more
 so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men
 and death once dead there's no more dying then
cxlvii
my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
the uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me and i desperate now approve
desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care
and franticmad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are
at random from the truth vainly express'd
 for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
 who art as black as hell as dark as night
cxlviii
o me what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
love's eye is not so true as all men's no'
how can it o how can love's eye be true
that is so vex'd with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears
 o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind
 lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find
cxlix
canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when i against myself with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of myself all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend
revenge upon myself with present moan
what merit do i in myself respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
 but love hate on for now i know thy mind
 those that can see thou lovest and i am blind
cl
o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantize of skill
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
 if thy unworthiness raised love in me
 more worthy i to be beloved of thee
cli
love is too young to know what conscience is
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body's treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love flesh stays no father reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
 no want of conscience hold it that i call
 her love for whose dear love i rise and fall
clii
in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
 for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
 to swear against the truth so foul a lie
cliii
cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dian's this advantage found
and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valleyfountain of that ground
which borrow'd from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
and grew a seething bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress eye love's brand newfired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distemper'd guest
 but found no cure the bath for my help lies
 where cupid got new firemy mistress eyes
cliv
the little lovegod lying once asleep
laid by his side his heartinflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warm'd
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
for men diseased but i my mistress thrall
 came there for cure and this by that i prove
 love's fire heats water water cools not love
 the passionate pilgrim
i
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutor'd youth
unskilful in the world's false forgeries
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although i know my years be past the best
i smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue
outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest
but wherefore says my love that she is young
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is a soothing tongue
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i'll lie with love and love with me
since that our faults in love thus smother'd be
ii
two loves i have of comfort and despair
that like two spirits do suggest me still
my better angel is a man right fair
my worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her fair pride
and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
for being both to me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another's hell
the truth i shall not know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out
iii
did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
'gainst whom the world could not hold argument
persuade my heart to this false perjury
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
a woman i forswore but i will prove
thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me
my vow was breath and breath a vapour is
then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine
exhale this vapour vow in thee it is
if broken then it is no fault of mine
if by me broke what fool is not so wise
to break an oath to win a paradise
iv
sweet cytherea sitting by a brook
with young adonis lovely fresh and green
did court the lad with many a lovely look
such looks as none could look but beauty's queen
she told him stories to delight his ear
she showed him favors to allure his eye
to win his heart she touch'd him here and there
touches so soft still conquer chastity
but whether unripe years did want conceit
or he refused to take her figured proffer
the tender nibbler would not touch the bait
but smile and jest at every gentle offer
then fell she on her back fair queen and toward
he rose and ran away ah fool too froward
v
if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
o never faith could hold if not to beauty vow'd
though to myself forsworn to thee i'll constant prove
those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bow'd
study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend
if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
thine eye jove's lightning seems thy voice his dreadful
thunder
which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
celestial as thou art o do not love that wrong
to sing heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue
vi
scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn
and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade
when cytherea all in love forlorn
a longing tarriance for adonis made
under an osier growing by a brook
a brook where adon used to cool his spleen
hot was the day she hotter that did look
for his approach that often there had been
anon he comes and throws his mantle by
and stood stark naked on the brook's green brim
the sun look'd on the world with glorious eye
yet not so wistly as this queen on him
he spying her bounced in whereas he stood
'o jove quoth she why was not i a flood'
vii
fair is my love but not so fair as fickle
mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty
brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittle
softer than wax and yet as iron rusty
a lily pale with damask dye to grace her
none fairer nor none falser to deface her
her lips to mine how often hath she joined
between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing
how many tales to please me hath she coined
dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing
yet in the midst of all her pure protestings
her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings
she burn'd with love as straw with fire flameth
she burn'd out love as soon as straw outburneth
she framed the love and yet she foil'd the framing
she bade love last and yet she fell aturning
was this a lover or a lecher whether
bad in the best though excellent in neither
viii
if music and sweet poetry agree
as they must needs the sister and the brother
then must the love be great twixt thee and me
because thou lovest the one and i the other
dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch
upon the lute doth ravish human sense
spenser to me whose deep conceit is such
as passing all conceit needs no defence
thou lovest to hear the sweet melodious sound
that phoebus lute the queen of music makes
and i in deep delight am chiefly drown'd
when as himself to singing he betakes
one god is god of both as poets feign
one knight loves both and both in thee remain
ix
fair was the morn when the fair queen of love
 
paler for sorrow than her milkwhite dove
for adon's sake a youngster proud and wild
her stand she takes upon a steepup hill
anon adonis comes with horn and hounds
she silly queen with more than love's good will
forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds
'once quoth she did i see a fair sweet youth
here in these brakes deepwounded with a boar
deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth
see in my thigh quoth she here was the sore'
she showed hers he saw more wounds than one
and blushing fled and left her all alone
x
sweet rose fair flower untimely pluck'd soon vaded
pluck'd in the bud and vaded in the spring
bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded
fair creature kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting
like a green plum that hangs upon a tree
and falls through wind before the fall should be
i weep for thee and yet no cause i have
for why thou left'st me nothing in thy will
and yet thou left'st me more than i did crave
for why i craved nothing of thee still
o yes dear friend i pardon crave of thee
thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me
xi
venus with young adonis sitting by her
under a myrtle shade began to woo him
she told the youngling how god mars did try her
and as he fell to her so fell she to him
'even thus quoth she the warlike god embraced me'
and then she clipp'd adonis in her arms
'even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me'
as if the boy should use like loving charms
'even thus quoth she he seized on my lips'
and with her lips on his did act the seizure
and as she fetched breath away he skips
and would not take her meaning nor her pleasure
ah that i had my lady at this bay
to kiss and clip me till i run away
xii
crabbed age and youth cannot live together
youth is full of pleasance age is full of care
youth like summer morn age like winter weather
youth like summer brave age like winter bare
youth is full of sport age's breath is short
youth is nimble age is lame
youth is hot and bold age is weak and cold
youth is wild and age is tame
age i do abhor thee youth i do adore thee
o my love my love is young
age i do defy thee o sweet shepherd hie thee
for methinks thou stay'st too long
xiii
beauty is but a vain and doubtful good
a shining gloss that vadeth suddenly
a flower that dies when first it gins to bud
a brittle glass that's broken presently
a doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower
lost vaded broken dead within an hour
and as goods lost are seld or never found
as vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh
as flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground
as broken glass no cement can redress
so beauty blemish'd once's for ever lost
in spite of physic painting pain and cost
xiv
good night good rest ah neither be my share
she bade good night that kept my rest away
and daff'd me to a cabin hang'd with care
to descant on the doubts of my decay
'farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow'
fare well i could not for i supp'd with sorrow
yet at my parting sweetly did she smile
in scorn or friendship nill i construe whether
't may be she joy'd to jest at my exile
't may be again to make me wander thither
'wander a word for shadows like myself
as take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf
xv
lord how mine eyes throw gazes to the east
my heart doth charge the watch the morning rise
doth cite each moving sense from idle rest
not daring trust the office of mine eyes
while philomela sits and sings i sit and mark
and wish her lays were tuned like the lark
for she doth welcome daylight with her ditty
and drives away dark dismaldreaming night
the night so pack'd i post unto my pretty
heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight
sorrow changed to solace solace mix'd with sorrow
for why she sigh'd and bade me come tomorrow
were i with her the night would post too soon
but now are minutes added to the hours
to spite me now each minute seems a moon
yet not for me shine sun to succor flowers
pack night peep day good day of night now borrow
short night tonight and length thyself tomorrow

it was a lording's daughter the fairest one of three
that liked of her master as well as well might be
till looking on an englishman the fair'st that eye could see
her fancy fell aturning
long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight
to leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight
to put in practise either alas it was a spite
unto the silly damsel
but one must be refused more mickle was the pain
that nothing could be used to turn them both to gain
for of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain
alas she could not help it
thus art with arms contending was victor of the day
which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away
then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gay
for now my song is ended
xvii
on a day alack the day
love whose month was ever may
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen gan passage find
that the lover sick to death
wish'd himself the heaven's breath
'air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
air would i might triumph so
but alas my hand hath sworn
ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
vow alack for youth unmeet
youth so apt to pluck a sweet
thou for whom jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were
and deny himself for jove
turning mortal for thy love'

my flocks feed not
my ewes breed not
my rams speed not
all is amiss
love's denying
faith's defying
heart's renying
causer of this
all my merry jigs are quite forgot
all my lady's love is lost god wot
where her faith was firmly fix'd in love
there a nay is placed without remove
one silly cross
wrought all my loss
o frowning fortune cursed fickle dame
for now i see
inconstancy
more in women than in men remain
in black mourn i
all fears scorn i
love hath forlorn me
living in thrall
heart is bleeding
all help needing
o cruel speeding
fraughted with gall
my shepherd's pipe can sound no deal
my wether's bell rings doleful knell
my curtail dog that wont to have play'd
plays not at all but seems afraid
my sighs so deep
procure to weep
in howling wise to see my doleful plight
how sighs resound
through heartless ground
like a thousand vanquish'd men in bloody fight
clear wells spring not
sweet birds sing not
green plants bring not
forth their dye
herds stand weeping
flocks all sleeping
nymphs back peeping
fearfully
all our pleasure known to us poor swains
all our merry meetings on the plains
all our evening sport from us is fled
all our love is lost for love is dead
farewell sweet lass
thy like ne'er was
for a sweet content the cause of all my moan
poor corydon
must live alone
other help for him i see that there is none

when as thine eye hath chose the dame
and stall'd the deer that thou shouldst strike
let reason rule things worthy blame
as well as fancy partial might
take counsel of some wiser head
neither too young nor yet unwed
and when thou comest thy tale to tell
smooth not thy tongue with filed talk
lest she some subtle practise smell
a cripple soon can find a halt
but plainly say thou lovest her well
and set thy person forth to sell
what though her frowning brows be bent
her cloudy looks will calm ere night
and then too late she will repent
that thus dissembled her delight
and twice desire ere it be day
that which with scorn she put away
what though she strive to try her strength
and ban and brawl and say thee nay
her feeble force will yield at length
when craft hath taught her thus to say
'had women been so strong as men
in faith you had not had it then'
and to her will frame all thy ways
spare not to spend and chiefly there
where thy desert may merit praise
by ringing in thy lady's ear
the strongest castle tower and town
the golden bullet beats it down
serve always with assured trust
and in thy suit be humble true
unless thy lady prove unjust
press never thou to choose anew
when time shall serve be thou not slack
to proffer though she put thee back
the wiles and guiles that women work
dissembled with an outward show
the tricks and toys that in them lurk
the cock that treads them shall not know
have you not heard it said full oft
a woman's nay doth stand for nought
think women still to strive with men
to sin and never for to saint
there is no heaven by holy then
when time with age doth them attaint
were kisses all the joys in bed
one woman would another wed
but soft enough too much i fear
lest that my mistress hear my song
she will not stick to round me i the ear
to teach my tongue to be so long
yet will she blush here be it said
to hear her secrets so bewray'd
xx
live with me and be my love
and we will all the pleasures prove
that hills and valleys dales and fields
and all the craggy mountains yields
there will we sit upon the rocks
and see the shepherds feed their flocks
by shallow rivers by whose falls
melodious birds sing madrigals
there will i make thee a bed of roses
with a thousand fragrant posies
a cap of flowers and a kirtle
embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle
a belt of straw and ivy buds
with coral clasps and amber studs
and if these pleasures may thee move
then live with me and be my love
love's answer
if that the world and love were young
and truth in every shepherd's tongue
these pretty pleasures might me move
to live with thee and be thy love

as it fell upon a day
in the merry month of may
sitting in a pleasant shade
which a grove of myrtles made
beasts did leap and birds did sing
trees did grow and plants did spring
every thing did banish moan
save the nightingale alone
she poor bird as all forlorn
lean'd her breast uptill a thorn
and there sung the dolefull'st ditty
that to hear it was great pity
'fie fie fie now would she cry
'tereu tereu by and by
that to hear her so complain
scarce i could from tears refrain
for her griefs so lively shown
made me think upon mine own
ah thought i thou mourn'st in vain
none takes pity on thy pain
senseless trees they cannot hear thee
ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee
king pandion he is dead
all thy friends are lapp'd in lead
all thy fellow birds do sing
careless of thy sorrowing
even so poor bird like thee
none alive will pity me
whilst as fickle fortune smiled
thou and i were both beguiled
every one that flatters thee
is no friend in misery
words are easy like the wind
faithful friends are hard to find
every man will be thy friend
whilst thou hast wherewith to spend
but if store of crowns be scant
no man will supply thy want
if that one be prodigal
bountiful they will him call
and with suchlike flattering
'pity but he were a king'
if he be addict to vice
quickly him they will entice
if to women he be bent
they have at commandement
but if fortune once do frown
then farewell his great renown
they that fawn'd on him before
use his company no more
he that is thy friend indeed
he will help thee in thy need
if thou sorrow he will weep
if thou wake he cannot sleep
thus of every grief in heart
he with thee doth bear a part
these are certain signs to know
faithful friend from flattering foe
 the phoenix and the turtle
 let the bird of loudest lay
 on the sole arabian tree
 herald sad and trumpet be
 to whose sound chaste wings obey
 but thou shrieking harbinger
 foul precurrer of the fiend
 augur of the fever's end
 to this troop come thou not near
 from this session interdict
 every fowl of tyrant wing
 save the eagle feather'd king
 keep the obsequy so strict
 let the priest in surplice white
 that defunctive music can
 be the deathdivining swan
 lest the requiem lack his right
 and thou trebledated crow
 that thy sable gender makest
 with the breath thou givest and takest
 mongst our mourners shalt thou go
 here the anthem doth commence
 love and constancy is dead
 phoenix and the turtle fled
 in a mutual flame from hence
 so they loved as love in twain
 had the essence but in one
 two distincts division none
 number there in love was slain
 hearts remote yet not asunder
 distance and no space was seen
 twixt the turtle and his queen
 but in them it were a wonder
 so between them love did shine
 that the turtle saw his right
 flaming in the phoenix sight
 either was the other's mine
 property was thus appalled
 that the self was not the same
 single nature's double name
 neither two nor one was called
 reason in itself confounded
 saw division grow together
 to themselves yet either neither
 simple were so well compounded
 that it cried how true a twain
 seemeth this concordant one
 love hath reason reason none
 if what parts can so remain
 whereupon it made this threne
 to the phoenix and the dove
 cosupremes and stars of love
 as chorus to their tragic scene
 threnos
 beauty truth and rarity
 grace in all simplicity
 here enclosed in cinders lie
 death is now the phoenix nest
 and the turtle's loyal breast
 to eternity doth rest
 leaving no posterity
 twas not their infirmity
 it was married chastity
 truth may seem but cannot be
 beauty brag but tis not she
 truth and beauty buried be
 to this urn let those repair
 that are either true or fair
 for these dead birds sigh a prayer

william shakespeare
even as the sun with purplecolour'd face
had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn
rosecheek'd adonis hied him to the chase
hunting he loved but love he laugh'd to scorn
sickthoughted venus makes amain unto him
and like a boldfaced suitor gins to woo him
'thricefairer than myself thus she began
'the field's chief flower sweet above compare
stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man
more white and red than doves or roses are
nature that made thee with herself at strife
saith that the world hath ending with thy life
'vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed
and rein his proud head to the saddlebow
if thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed
a thousand honey secrets shalt thou know
here come and sit where never serpent hisses
and being set i'll smother thee with kisses
'and yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety
but rather famish them amid their plenty
making them red and pale with fresh variety
ten kisses short as one one long as twenty
a summer's day will seem an hour but short
being wasted in such timebeguiling sport'
with this she seizeth on his sweating palm
the precedent of pith and livelihood
and trembling in her passion calls it balm
earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good
being so enraged desire doth lend her force
courageously to pluck him from his horse
over one arm the lusty courser's rein
under her other was the tender boy
who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain
with leaden appetite unapt to toy
she red and hot as coals of glowing fire
he red for shame but frosty in desire
the studded bridle on a ragged bough
nimbly she fastenso how quick is love
the steed is stalled up and even now
to tie the rider she begins to prove
backward she push'd him as she would be thrust
and govern'd him in strength though not in lust
so soon was she along as he was down
each leaning on their elbows and their hips
now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
and gins to chide but soon she stops his lips
and kissing speaks with lustful language broken
'if thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open'
he burns with bashful shame she with her tears
doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks
then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
to fan and blow them dry again she seeks
he saith she is immodest blames her miss
what follows more she murders with a kiss
even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone
shaking her wings devouring all in haste
till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone
even so she kissed his brow his cheek his chin
and where she ends she doth anew begin
forced to content but never to obey
panting he lies and breatheth in her face
she feedeth on the steam as on a prey
and calls it heavenly moisture air of grace
wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
so they were dew'd with such distilling showers
look how a bird lies tangled in a net
so fasten'd in her arms adonis lies
pure shame and awed resistance made him fret
which bred more beauty in his angry eyes
rain added to a river that is rank
perforce will force it overflow the bank
still she entreats and prettily entreats
for to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
still is he sullen still he lours and frets
'twixt crimson shame and anger ashypale
being red she loves him best and being white
her best is better'd with a more delight
look how he can she cannot choose but love
and by her fair immortal hand she swears
from his soft bosom never to remove
till he take truce with her contending tears
which long have rain'd making her cheeks all wet
and one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt
upon this promise did he raise his chin
like a divedapper peering through a wave
who being look'd on ducks as quickly in
so offers he to give what she did crave
but when her lips were ready for his pay
he winks and turns his lips another way
never did passenger in summer's heat
more thirst for drink than she for this good turn
her help she sees but help she cannot get
she bathes in water yet her fire must burn
'o pity gan she cry flinthearted boy
'tis but a kiss i beg why art thou coy
'i have been woo'd as i entreat thee now
even by the stern and direful god of war
whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow
who conquers where he comes in every jar
yet hath he been my captive and my slave
and begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have
'over my altars hath he hung his lance
his batter'd shield his uncontrolled crest
and for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance
to toy to wanton dally smile and jest
scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
making my arms his field his tent my bed
'thus he that overruled i oversway'd
leading him prisoner in a redrose chain
strongtempered steel his stronger strength obey'd
yet was he servile to my coy disdain
o be not proud nor brag not of thy might
for mastering her that foil'd the god of fight
'touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine
though mine be not so fair yet are they red
the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine
what seest thou in the ground hold up thy head
look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies
then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes
'art thou ashamed to kiss then wink again
and i will wink so shall the day seem night
love keeps his revels where they are but twain
be bold to play our sport is not in sight
these bluevein'd violets whereon we lean
never can blab nor know not what we mean
'the tender spring upon thy tempting lip
shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted
make use of time let not advantage slip
beauty within itself should not be wasted
fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
rot and consume themselves in little time
'were i hardfavour'd foul or wrinkledold
illnurtured crooked churlish harsh in voice
o'erworn despised rheumatic and cold
thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice
then mightst thou pause for then i were not for thee
but having no defects why dost abhor me
'thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow
mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning
my beauty as the spring doth yearly grow
my flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning
my smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt
would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt
'bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear
or like a fairy trip upon the green
or like a nymph with long dishevell'd hair
dance on the sands and yet no footing seen
love is a spirit all compact of fire
not gross to sink but light and will aspire
'witness this primrose bank whereon i lie
these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me
two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky
from morn till night even where i list to sport me
is love so light sweet boy and may it be
that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee
'is thine own heart to thine own face affected
can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
then woo thyself be of thyself rejected
steal thine own freedom and complain on theft
narcissus so himself himself forsook
and died to kiss his shadow in the brook
'torches are made to light jewels to wear
dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use
herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear
things growing to themselves are growth's abuse
seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty
thou wast begot to get it is thy duty
'upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed
unless the earth with thy increase be fed
by law of nature thou art bound to breed
that thine may live when thou thyself art dead
and so in spite of death thou dost survive
in that thy likeness still is left alive'
by this the lovesick queen began to sweat
for where they lay the shadow had forsook them
and titan tired in the midday heat
with burning eye did hotly overlook them
wishing adonis had his team to guide
so he were like him and by venus side
and now adonis with a lazy spright
and with a heavy dark disliking eye
his louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight
like misty vapours when they blot the sky
souring his cheeks cries fie no more of love
the sun doth burn my face i must remove'
'ay me quoth venus young and so unkind
what bare excuses makest thou to be gone
i'll sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
shall cool the heat of this descending sun
i'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs
if they burn too i'll quench them with my tears
'the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm
and lo i lie between that sun and thee
the heat i have from thence doth little harm
thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me
and were i not immortal life were done
between this heavenly and earthly sun
'art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth
art thou a woman's son and canst not feel
what tis to love how want of love tormenteth
o had thy mother borne so hard a mind
she had not brought forth thee but died unkind
'what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this
or what great danger dwells upon my suit
what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute
give me one kiss i'll give it thee again
and one for interest if thou wilt have twain
'fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone
wellpainted idol image dun and dead
statue contenting but the eye alone
thing like a man but of no woman bred
thou art no man though of a man's complexion
for men will kiss even by their own direction'
this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue
and swelling passion doth provoke a pause
red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong
being judge in love she cannot right her cause
and now she weeps and now she fain would speak
and now her sobs do her intendments break
sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand
now gazeth she on him now on the ground
sometimes her arms infold him like a band
she would he will not in her arms be bound
and when from thence he struggles to be gone
she locks her lily fingers one in one
'fondling she saith since i have hemm'd thee here
within the circuit of this ivory pale
i'll be a park and thou shalt be my deer
feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale
graze on my lips and if those hills be dry
stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie
within this limit is relief enough
sweet bottomgrass and high delightful plain
round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough
to shelter thee from tempest and from rain
then be my deer since i am such a park
no dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark'
at this adonis smiles as in disdain
that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple
love made those hollows if himself were slain
he might be buried in a tomb so simple
foreknowing well if there he came to lie
why there love lived and there he could not die
these lovely caves these round enchanting pits
open'd their mouths to swallow venus liking
being mad before how doth she now for wits
struck dead at first what needs a second striking
poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn
to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn
now which way shall she turn what shall she say
her words are done her woes are more increasing
the time is spent her object will away
and from her twining arms doth urge releasing
'pity she cries some favour some remorse'
away he springs and hasteth to his horse
but lo from forth a copse that neighbors by
a breeding jennet lusty young and proud
adonis trampling courser doth espy
and forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud
the strongneck'd steed being tied unto a tree
breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he
imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
and now his woven girths he breaks asunder
the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder
the iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth
controlling what he was controlled with
his ears upprick'd his braided hanging mane
upon his compass'd crest now stand on end
his nostrils drink the air and forth again
as from a furnace vapours doth he send
his eye which scornfully glisters like fire
shows his hot courage and his high desire
sometime he trots as if he told the steps
with gentle majesty and modest pride
anon he rears upright curvets and leaps
as who should say lo thus my strength is tried
and this i do to captivate the eye
of the fair breeder that is standing by'
what recketh he his rider's angry stir
his flattering holla or his stand i say'
what cares he now for curb or pricking spur
for rich caparisons or trapping gay
he sees his love and nothing else he sees
for nothing else with his proud sight agrees
look when a painter would surpass the life
in limning out a wellproportion'd steed
his art with nature's workmanship at strife
as if the dead the living should exceed
so did this horse excel a common one
in shape in courage colour pace and bone
roundhoof'd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long
broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide
high crest short ears straight legs and passing strong
thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
look what a horse should have he did not lack
save a proud rider on so proud a back
sometime he scuds far off and there he stares
anon he starts at stirring of a feather
to bid the wind a base he now prepares
and whether he run or fly they know not whether
for through his mane and tail the high wind sings
fanning the hairs who wave like feather'd wings
he looks upon his love and neighs unto her
she answers him as if she knew his mind
being proud as females are to see him woo her
she puts on outward strangeness seems unkind
spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
beating his kind embracements with her heels
then like a melancholy malcontent
he veils his tail that like a falling plume
cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume
his love perceiving how he is enraged
grew kinder and his fury was assuaged
his testy master goeth about to take him
when lo the unback'd breeder full of fear
jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him
with her the horse and left adonis there
as they were mad unto the wood they hie them
outstripping crows that strive to overfly them
all swoln with chafing down adonis sits
banning his boisterous and unruly beast
and now the happy season once more fits
that lovesick love by pleading may be blest
for lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
when it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue
an oven that is stopp'd or river stay'd
burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage
so of concealed sorrow may be said
free vent of words love's fire doth assuage
but when the heart's attorney once is mute
the client breaks as desperate in his suit
he sees her coming and begins to glow
even as a dying coal revives with wind
and with his bonnet hides his angry brow
looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind
taking no notice that she is so nigh
for all askance he holds her in his eye
o what a sight it was wistly to view
how she came stealing to the wayward boy
to note the fighting conflict of her hue
how white and red each other did destroy
but now her cheek was pale and by and by
it flash'd forth fire as lightning from the sky
now was she just before him as he sat
and like a lowly lover down she kneels
with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
her other tender hand his fair cheek feels
his tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print
as apt as newfall'n snow takes any dint
o what a war of looks was then between them
her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing
his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them
her eyes woo'd still his eyes disdain'd the wooing
and all this dumb play had his acts made plain
with tears which choruslike her eyes did rain
full gently now she takes him by the hand
a lily prison'd in a gaol of snow
or ivory in an alabaster band
so white a friend engirts so white a foe
this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling
show'd like two silver doves that sit abilling
once more the engine of her thoughts began
'o fairest mover on this mortal round
would thou wert as i am and i a man
my heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound
for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee
though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee
'give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it'
'give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it
o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
and being steel'd soft sighs can never grave it
then love's deep groans i never shall regard
because adonis heart hath made mine hard'
'for shame he cries let go and let me go
my day's delight is past my horse is gone
and tis your fault i am bereft him so
i pray you hence and leave me here alone
for all my mind my thought my busy care
is how to get my palfrey from the mare'
thus she replies thy palfrey as he should
welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire
affection is a coal that must be cool'd
else suffer'd it will set the heart on fire
the sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none
therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone
'how like a jade he stood tied to the tree
servilely master'd with a leathern rein
but when he saw his love his youth's fair fee
he held such petty bondage in disdain
throwing the base thong from his bending crest
enfranchising his mouth his back his breast
'who sees his truelove in her naked bed
teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white
but when his glutton eye so full hath fed
his other agents aim at like delight
who is so faint that dare not be so bold
to touch the fire the weather being cold
'let me excuse thy courser gentle boy
and learn of him i heartily beseech thee
to take advantage on presented joy
though i were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
o learn to love the lesson is but plain
and once made perfect never lost again'
i know not love quoth he nor will not know it
unless it be a boar and then i chase it
'tis much to borrow and i will not owe it
my love to love is love but to disgrace it
for i have heard it is a life in death
that laughs and weeps and all but with a breath
'who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd
who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth
if springing things be any jot diminish'd
they wither in their prime prove nothing worth
the colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
loseth his pride and never waxeth strong
'you hurt my hand with wringing let us part
and leave this idle theme this bootless chat
remove your siege from my unyielding heart
to love's alarms it will not ope the gate
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery
for where a heart is hard they make no battery'
'what canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue
o would thou hadst not or i had no hearing
thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong
i had my load before now press'd with bearing
melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding
ear's deepsweet music and heart's deepsore wounding
'had i no eyes but ears my ears would love
that inward beauty and invisible
or were i deaf thy outward parts would move
each part in me that were but sensible
though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see
yet should i be in love by touching thee
'say that the sense of feeling were bereft me
and that i could not see nor hear nor touch
and nothing but the very smell were left me
yet would my love to thee be still as much
for from the stillitory of thy face excelling
comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by
smelling
'but o what banquet wert thou to the taste
being nurse and feeder of the other four
would they not wish the feast might ever last
and bid suspicion doublelock the door
lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest
should by his stealing in disturb the feast'
once more the rubycolour'd portal open'd
which to his speech did honey passage yield
like a red morn that ever yet betoken'd
wreck to the seaman tempest to the field
sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds
gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds
this ill presage advisedly she marketh
even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth
or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh
or as the berry breaks before it staineth
or like the deadly bullet of a gun
his meaning struck her ere his words begun
and at his look she flatly falleth down
for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth
a smile recures the wounding of a frown
but blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth
the silly boy believing she is dead
claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red
and all amazed brake off his late intent
for sharply he did think to reprehend her
which cunning love did wittily prevent
fair fall the wit that can so well defend her
for on the grass she lies as she were slain
till his breath breatheth life in her again
he wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks
he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard
he chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks
to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd
he kisses her and she by her good will
will never rise so he will kiss her still
the night of sorrow now is turn'd to day
her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth
like the fair sun when in his fresh array
he cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth
and as the bright sun glorifies the sky
so is her face illumined with her eye
whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd
as if from thence they borrow'd all their shine
were never four such lamps together mix'd
had not his clouded with his brow's repine
but hers which through the crystal tears gave light
shone like the moon in water seen by night
'o where am i quoth she in earth or heaven
or in the ocean drench'd or in the fire
what hour is this or morn or weary even
do i delight to die or life desire
but now i lived and life was death's annoy
but now i died and death was lively joy
'o thou didst kill me kill me once again
thy eyes shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine
hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
that they have murder'd this poor heart of mine
and these mine eyes true leaders to their queen
but for thy piteous lips no more had seen
'long may they kiss each other for this cure
o never let their crimson liveries wear
and as they last their verdure still endure
to drive infection from the dangerous year
that the stargazers having writ on death
may say the plague is banish'd by thy breath
'pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted
what bargains may i make still to be sealing
to sell myself i can be well contented
so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing
which purchase if thou make for fear of slips
set thy sealmanual on my waxred lips
'a thousand kisses buys my heart from me
and pay them at thy leisure one by one
what is ten hundred touches unto thee
are they not quickly told and quickly gone
say for nonpayment that the debt should double
is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble
'fair queen quoth he if any love you owe me
measure my strangeness with my unripe years
before i know myself seek not to know me
no fisher but the ungrown fry forbears
the mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast
or being early pluck'd is sour to taste
'look the world's comforter with weary gait
his day's hot task hath ended in the west
the owl night's herald shrieks 'tis very late'
the sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest
and coalblack clouds that shadow heaven's light
do summon us to part and bid good night
'now let me say good night and so say you
if you will say so you shall have a kiss'
'good night quoth she and ere he says adieu'
the honey fee of parting tender'd is
her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
incorporate then they seem face grows to face
till breathless he disjoin'd and backward drew
the heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth
whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth
he with her plenty press'd she faint with dearth
their lips together glued fall to the earth
now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey
and gluttonlike she feeds yet never filleth
her lips are conquerors his lips obey
paying what ransom the insulter willeth
whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
that she will draw his lips rich treasure dry
and having felt the sweetness of the spoil
with blindfold fury she begins to forage
her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil
and careless lust stirs up a desperate courage
planting oblivion beating reason back
forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack
hot faint and weary with her hard embracing
like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling
or as the fleetfoot roe that's tired with chasing
or like the froward infant still'd with dandling
he now obeys and now no more resisteth
while she takes all she can not all she listeth
what wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering
and yields at last to every light impression
things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing
chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission
affection faints not like a palefaced coward
but then woos best when most his choice is froward
when he did frown o had she then gave over
such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd
foul words and frowns must not repel a lover
what though the rose have prickles yet tis pluck'd
were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
yet love breaks through and picks them all at last
for pity now she can no more detain him
the poor fool prays her that he may depart
she is resolved no longer to restrain him
bids him farewell and look well to her heart
the which by cupid's bow she doth protest
he carries thence incaged in his breast
'sweet boy she says this night i'll waste in sorrow
for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
tell me love's master shall we meet tomorrow
say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match'
he tells her no tomorrow he intends
to hunt the boar with certain of his friends
'the boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale
like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale
and on his neck her yoking arms she throws
she sinketh down still hanging by his neck
he on her belly falls she on her back
now is she in the very lists of love
her champion mounted for the hot encounter
all is imaginary she doth prove
he will not manage her although he mount her
that worse than tantalus is her annoy
to clip elysium and to lack her joy
even as poor birds deceived with painted grapes
do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
even so she languisheth in her mishaps
as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
the warm effects which she in him finds missing
she seeks to kindle with continual kissing
but all in vain good queen it will not be
she hath assay'd as much as may be proved
her pleading hath deserved a greater fee
she's love she loves and yet she is not loved
'fie fie he says you crush me let me go
you have no reason to withhold me so'
'thou hadst been gone quoth she sweet boy ere this
but that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar
o be advised thou know'st not what it is
with javelin's point a churlish swine to gore
whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still
like to a mortal butcher bent to kill
'on his bowback he hath a battle set
of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes
his eyes like glowworms shine when he doth fret
his snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes
being moved he strikes whate'er is in his way
and whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay
'his brawny sides with hairy bristles arm'd
are better proof than thy spear's point can enter
his short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd
being ireful on the lion he will venture
the thorny brambles and embracing bushes
as fearful of him part through whom he rushes
'alas he nought esteems that face of thine
to which love's eyes pay tributary gazes
nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne
whose full perfection all the world amazes
but having thee at vantagewondrous dread
would root these beauties as he roots the mead
'o let him keep his loathsome cabin still
beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends
come not within his danger by thy will
they that thrive well take counsel of their friends
when thou didst name the boar not to dissemble
i fear'd thy fortune and my joints did tremble
'didst thou not mark my face was it not white
saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye
grew i not faint and fell i not downright
within my bosom whereon thou dost lie
my boding heart pants beats and takes no rest
but like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast
'for where love reigns disturbing jealousy
doth call himself affection's sentinel
gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny
and in a peaceful hour doth cry kill kill'
distempering gentle love in his desire
as air and water do abate the fire
'this sour informer this batebreeding spy
this canker that eats up love's tender spring
this carrytale dissentious jealousy
that sometime true news sometime false doth bring
knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
that if i love thee i thy death should fear
'and more than so presenteth to mine eye
the picture of an angrychafing boar
under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
an image like thyself all stain'd with gore
whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
doth make them droop with grief and hang the head
'what should i do seeing thee so indeed
that tremble at the imagination
the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed
and fear doth teach it divination
i prophesy thy death my living sorrow
if thou encounter with the boar tomorrow
'but if thou needs wilt hunt be ruled by me
uncouple at the timorous flying hare
or at the fox which lives by subtlety
or at the roe which no encounter dare
pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs
and on thy wellbreath'd horse keep with thy
hounds
'and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare
mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles
how he outruns the wind and with what care
he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
the many musets through the which he goes
are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes
'sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
and sometime where earthdelving conies keep
to stop the loud pursuers in their yell
and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear
'for there his smell with others being mingled
the hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt
ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
with much ado the cold fault cleanly out
then do they spend their mouths echo replies
as if another chase were in the skies
'by this poor wat far off upon a hill
stands on his hinder legs with listening ear
to harken if his foes pursue him still
anon their loud alarums he doth hear
and now his grief may be compared well
to one sore sick that hears the passingbell
'then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch
turn and return indenting with the way
each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch
each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
for misery is trodden on by many
and being low never relieved by any
'lie quietly and hear a little more
nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise
to make thee hate the hunting of the boar
unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize
applying this to that and so to so
for love can comment upon every woe
'where did i leave no matter where quoth he
'leave me and then the story aptly ends
the night is spent why what of that quoth she
'i am quoth he expected of my friends
and now tis dark and going i shall fall'
'in night quoth she desire sees best of all
'but if thou fall o then imagine this
the earth in love with thee thy footing trips
and all is but to rob thee of a kiss
rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
make modest dian cloudy and forlorn
lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn
'now of this dark night i perceive the reason
cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine
till forging nature be condemn'd of treason
for stealing moulds from heaven that were divine
wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite
to shame the sun by day and her by night
'and therefore hath she bribed the destinies
to cross the curious workmanship of nature
to mingle beauty with infirmities
and pure perfection with impure defeature
making it subject to the tyranny
of mad mischances and much misery
'as burning fevers agues pale and faint
lifepoisoning pestilence and frenzies wood
the marroweating sickness whose attaint
disorder breeds by heating of the blood
surfeits imposthumes grief and damn'd despair
swear nature's death for framing thee so fair
'and not the least of all these maladies
but in one minute's fight brings beauty under
both favour savour hue and qualities
whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder
are on the sudden wasted thaw'd and done
as mountainsnow melts with the midday sun
'therefore despite of fruitless chastity
lovelacking vestals and selfloving nuns
that on the earth would breed a scarcity
and barren dearth of daughters and of sons
be prodigal the lamp that burns by night
dries up his oil to lend the world his light
'what is thy body but a swallowing grave
seeming to bury that posterity
which by the rights of time thou needs must have
if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity
if so the world will hold thee in disdain
sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain
'so in thyself thyself art made away
a mischief worse than civil homebred strife
or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
or butchersire that reaves his son of life
foulcankering rust the hidden treasure frets
but gold that's put to use more gold begets'
'nay then quoth adon you will fall again
into your idle overhandled theme
the kiss i gave you is bestow'd in vain
and all in vain you strive against the stream
for by this blackfaced night desire's foul nurse
your treatise makes me like you worse and worse
'if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues
and every tongue more moving than your own
bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs
yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
for know my heart stands armed in mine ear
and will not let a false sound enter there
'lest the deceiving harmony should run
into the quiet closure of my breast
and then my little heart were quite undone
in his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest
no lady no my heart longs not to groan
but soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone
'what have you urged that i cannot reprove
the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger
i hate not love but your device in love
that lends embracements unto every stranger
you do it for increase o strange excuse
when reason is the bawd to lust's abuse
'call it not love for love to heaven is fled
since sweating lust on earth usurp'd his name
under whose simple semblance he hath fed
upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame
which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
as caterpillars do the tender leaves
'love comforteth like sunshine after rain
but lust's effect is tempest after sun
love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain
lust's winter comes ere summer half be done
love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies
love is all truth lust full of forged lies
'more i could tell but more i dare not say
the text is old the orator too green
therefore in sadness now i will away
my face is full of shame my heart of teen
mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
do burn themselves for having so offended'
with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
and homeward through the dark laund runs apace
leaves love upon her back deeply distress'd
look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
so glides he in the night from venus eye
which after him she darts as one on shore
gazing upon a lateembarked friend
till the wild waves will have him seen no more
whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend
so did the merciless and pitchy night
fold in the object that did feed her sight
whereat amazed as one that unaware
hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood
or stonish'd as nightwanderers often are
their light blown out in some mistrustful wood
even so confounded in the dark she lay
having lost the fair discovery of her way
and now she beats her heart whereat it groans
that all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled
make verbal repetition of her moans
passion on passion deeply is redoubled
'ay me she cries and twenty times woe woe'
and twenty echoes twenty times cry so
she marking them begins a wailing note
and sings extemporally a woeful ditty
how love makes young men thrall and old men dote
how love is wise in folly foolishwitty
her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
and still the choir of echoes answer so
her song was tedious and outwore the night
for lovers hours are long though seeming short
if pleased themselves others they think delight
in suchlike circumstance with suchlike sport
their copious stories oftentimes begun
end without audience and are never done
for who hath she to spend the night withal
but idle sounds resembling parasites
like shrilltongued tapsters answering every call
soothing the humour of fantastic wits
she says 'tis so they answer all 'tis so'
and would say after her if she said no'
lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
from his moist cabinet mounts up on high
and wakes the morning from whose silver breast
the sun ariseth in his majesty
who doth the world so gloriously behold
that cedartops and hills seem burnish'd gold
venus salutes him with this fair goodmorrow
'o thou clear god and patron of all light
from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
the beauteous influence that makes him bright
there lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother
may lend thee light as thou dost lend to other'
this said she hasteth to a myrtle grove
musing the morning is so much o'erworn
and yet she hears no tidings of her love
she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn
anon she hears them chant it lustily
and all in haste she coasteth to the cry
and as she runs the bushes in the way
some catch her by the neck some kiss her face
some twine about her thigh to make her stay
she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache
hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake
by this she hears the hounds are at a bay
whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way
the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder
even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
appals her senses and her spirit confounds
for now she knows it is no gentle chase
but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud
because the cry remaineth in one place
where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud
finding their enemy to be so curst
they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first
this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear
through which it enters to surprise her heart
who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear
with coldpale weakness numbs each feeling part
like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
they basely fly and dare not stay the field
thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy
till cheering up her senses all dismay'd
she tells them tis a causeless fantasy
and childish error that they are afraid
bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more
and with that word she spied the hunted boar
whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red
like milk and blood being mingled both together
a second fear through all her sinews spread
which madly hurries her she knows not whither
this way runs and now she will no further
but back retires to rate the boar for murther
a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways
she treads the path that she untreads again
her more than haste is mated with delays
like the proceedings of a drunken brain
full of respects yet nought at all respecting
in hand with all things nought at all effecting
here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound
and asks the weary caitiff for his master
and there another licking of his wound
'gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster
and here she meets another sadly scowling
to whom she speaks and he replies with howling
when he hath ceased his illresounding noise
another flapmouth'd mourner black and grim
against the welkin volleys out his voice
another and another answer him
clapping their proud tails to the ground below
shaking their scratch'd ears bleeding as they go
look how the world's poor people are amazed
at apparitions signs and prodigies
whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed
infusing them with dreadful prophecies
so she at these sad signs draws up her breath
and sighing it again exclaims on death
'hardfavour'd tyrant ugly meagre lean
hateful divorce of love'thus chides she death
'grimgrinning ghost earth's worm what dost thou mean
to stifle beauty and to steal his breath
who when he lived his breath and beauty set
gloss on the rose smell to the violet
'if he be deado no it cannot be
seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it
o yes it may thou hast no eyes to see
but hatefully at random dost thou hit
thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart
mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart
'hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
and hearing him thy power had lost his power
the destinies will curse thee for this stroke
they bid thee crop a weed thou pluck'st a flower
love's golden arrow at him should have fled
and not death's ebon dart to strike dead
'dost thou drink tears that thou provokest such weeping
what may a heavy groan advantage thee
why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
those eyes that taught all other eyes to see
now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour'
here overcome as one full of despair
she vail'd her eyelids who like sluices stopt
the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
in the sweet channel of her bosom dropt
but through the floodgates breaks the silver rain
and with his strong course opens them again
o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow
her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye
both crystals where they view'd each other's sorrow
sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry
but like a stormy day now wind now rain
sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again
variable passions throng her constant woe
as striving who should best become her grief
all entertain'd each passion labours so
that every present sorrow seemeth chief
but none is best then join they all together
like many clouds consulting for foul weather
by this far off she hears some huntsman hollo
a nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well
the dire imagination she did follow
this sound of hope doth labour to expel
for now reviving joy bids her rejoice
and flatters her it is adonis voice
whereat her tears began to turn their tide
being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass
yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass
to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd
o hardbelieving love how strange it seems
not to believe and yet too credulous
thy weal and woe are both of them extremes
despair and hope makes thee ridiculous
the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly
now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought
adonis lives and death is not to blame
it was not she that call'd him allto naught
now she adds honours to his hateful name
she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings
imperious supreme of all mortal things
'no no quoth she sweet death i did but jest
yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear
when as i met the boar that bloody beast
which knows no pity but is still severe
then gentle shadowtruth i must confess
i rail'd on thee fearing my love's decease
''tis not my fault the boar provoked my tongue
be wreak'd on him invisible commander
'tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong
i did but act he's author of thy slander
grief hath two tongues and never woman yet
could rule them both without ten women's wit'
thus hoping that adonis is alive
her rash suspect she doth extenuate
and that his beauty may the better thrive
with death she humbly doth insinuate
tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
his victories his triumphs and his glories
'o jove quoth she how much a fool was i
to be of such a weak and silly mind
to wail his death who lives and must not die
till mutual overthrow of mortal kind
for he being dead with him is beauty slain
and beauty dead black chaos comes again
'fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear
as one with treasure laden hemm'd thieves
trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves'
even at this word she hears a merry horn
whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn
as falcon to the lure away she flies
the grass stoops not she treads on it so light
and in her haste unfortunately spies
the foul boar's conquest on her fair delight
which seen her eyes as murder'd with the view
like stars ashamed of day themselves withdrew
or as the snail whose tender horns being hit
shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain
and there all smother'd up in shade doth sit
long after fearing to creep forth again
so at his bloody view her eyes are fled
into the deep dark cabins of her head
where they resign their office and their light
to the disposing of her troubled brain
who bids them still consort with ugly night
and never wound the heart with looks again
who like a king perplexed in his throne
by their suggestion gives a deadly groan
whereat each tributary subject quakes
as when the wind imprison'd in the ground
struggling for passage earth's foundation shakes
which with cold terror doth men's minds confound
this mutiny each part doth so surprise
that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes
and being open'd threw unwilling light
upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
in his soft flank whose wonted lily white
with purple tears that his wound wept was drench'd
no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
but stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed
this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth
over one shoulder doth she hang her head
dumbly she passions franticly she doteth
she thinks he could not die he is not dead
her voice is stopt her joints forget to bow
her eyes are mad that they have wept til now
upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three
and then she reprehends her mangling eye
that makes more gashes where no breach should be
his face seems twain each several limb is doubled
for oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled
'my tongue cannot express my grief for one
and yet quoth she behold two adons dead
my sighs are blown away my salt tears gone
mine eyes are turn'd to fire my heart to lead
heavy heart's lead melt at mine eyes red fire
so shall i die by drops of hot desire
'alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
what face remains alive that's worth the viewing
whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast
of things long since or any thing ensuing
the flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim
but truesweet beauty lived and died with him
'bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear
nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you
having no fair to lose you need not fear
the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you
but when adonis lived sun and sharp air
lurk'd like two thieves to rob him of his fair
'and therefore would he put his bonnet on
under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep
the wind would blow it off and being gone
play with his locks then would adonis weep
and straight in pity of his tender years
they both would strive who first should dry his tears
'to see his face the lion walk'd along
behind some hedge because he would not fear him
to recreate himself when he hath sung
the tiger would be tame and gently hear him
if he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey
and never fright the silly lamb that day
'when he beheld his shadow in the brook
the fishes spread on it their golden gills
when he was by the birds such pleasure took
that some would sing some other in their bills
would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries
he fed them with his sight they him with berries
'but this foul grim and urchinsnouted boar
whose downward eye still looketh for a grave
ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore
witness the entertainment that he gave
if he did see his face why then i know
he thought to kiss him and hath kill'd him so
''tis true tis true thus was adonis slain
he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear
who did not whet his teeth at him again
but by a kiss thought to persuade him there
and nuzzling in his flank the loving swine
sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin
'had i been tooth'd like him i must confess
with kissing him i should have kill'd him first
but he is dead and never did he bless
my youth with his the more am i accurst'
with this she falleth in the place she stood
and stains her face with his congealed blood
she looks upon his lips and they are pale
she takes him by the hand and that is cold
she whispers in his ears a heavy tale
as if they heard the woeful words she told
she lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes
where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies
two glasses where herself herself beheld
a thousand times and now no more reflect
their virtue lost wherein they late excell'd
and every beauty robb'd of his effect
'wonder of time quoth she this is my spite
that thou being dead the day should yet be light
'since thou art dead lo here i prophesy
sorrow on love hereafter shall attend
it shall be waited on with jealousy
find sweet beginning but unsavoury end
ne'er settled equally but high or low
that all love's pleasure shall not match his woe
'it shall be fickle false and full of fraud
bud and be blasted in a breathingwhile
the bottom poison and the top o'erstraw'd
with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile
the strongest body shall it make most weak
strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak
'it shall be sparing and too full of riot
teaching decrepit age to tread the measures
the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet
pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures
it shall be ragingmad and sillymild
make the young old the old become a child
'it shall suspect where is no cause of fear
it shall not fear where it should most mistrust
it shall be merciful and too severe
and most deceiving when it seems most just
perverse it shall be where it shows most toward
put fear to valour courage to the coward
'it shall be cause of war and dire events
and set dissension twixt the son and sire
subject and servile to all discontents
as dry combustious matter is to fire
sith in his prime death doth my love destroy
they that love best their loves shall not enjoy'
by this the boy that by her side lay kill'd
was melted like a vapour from her sight
and in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd
a purple flower sprung up chequer'd with white
resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
which in round drops upon their whiteness stood
she bows her head the newsprung flower to smell
comparing it to her adonis breath
and says within her bosom it shall dwell
since he himself is reft from her by death
she crops the stalk and in the breach appears
green dropping sap which she compares to tears
'poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise
sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire
for every little grief to wet his eyes
to grow unto himself was his desire
and so tis thine but know it is as good
to wither in my breast as in his blood
'here was thy father's bed here in my breast
thou art the next of blood and tis thy right
lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest
my throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night
there shall not be one minute in an hour
wherein i will not kiss my sweet love's flower'
thus weary of the world away she hies
and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
their mistress mounted through the empty skies
in her light chariot quickly is convey'd
holding their course to paphos where their queen
means to immure herself and not be seen

act i
scene i rousillon the count's palace
 enter bertram the countess of rousillon helena
 and lafeu all in black
countess in delivering my son from me i bury a second husband
bertram and i in going madam weep o'er my father's death
 anew but i must attend his majesty's command to
 whom i am now in ward evermore in subjection
lafeu you shall find of the king a husband madam you
 sir a father he that so generally is at all times
 good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose
 worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
 than lack it where there is such abundance
countess what hope is there of his majesty's amendment
lafeu he hath abandoned his physicians madam under whose
 practises he hath persecuted time with hope and
 finds no other advantage in the process but only the
 losing of hope by time
countess this young gentlewoman had a fathero that
 had how sad a passage tiswhose skill was
 almost as great as his honesty had it stretched so
 far would have made nature immortal and death
 should have play for lack of work would for the
 king's sake he were living i think it would be
 the death of the king's disease
lafeu how called you the man you speak of madam
countess he was famous sir in his profession and it was
 his great right to be so gerard de narbon
lafeu he was excellent indeed madam the king very
 lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he
 was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge
 could be set up against mortality
bertram what is it my good lord the king languishes of
lafeu a fistula my lord
bertram i heard not of it before
lafeu i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman
 the daughter of gerard de narbon
countess his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my
 overlooking i have those hopes of her good that
 her education promises her dispositions she
 inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where
 an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there
 commendations go with pity they are virtues and
 traitors too in her they are the better for their
 simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness
lafeu your commendations madam get from her tears
countess tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
 in the remembrance of her father never approaches
 her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
 livelihood from her cheek no more of this helena
 go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect
 a sorrow than have it
helena i do affect a sorrow indeed but i have it too
lafeu moderate lamentation is the right of the dead
 excessive grief the enemy to the living
countess if the living be enemy to the grief the excess
 makes it soon mortal
bertram madam i desire your holy wishes
lafeu how understand we that
countess be thou blest bertram and succeed thy father
 in manners as in shape thy blood and virtue
 contend for empire in thee and thy goodness
 share with thy birthright love all trust a few
 do wrong to none be able for thine enemy
 rather in power than use and keep thy friend
 under thy own life's key be cheque'd for silence
 but never tax'd for speech what heaven more will
 that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down
 fall on thy head farewell my lord
 tis an unseason'd courtier good my lord
 advise him
lafeu he cannot want the best
 that shall attend his love
countess heaven bless him farewell bertram
 exit
bertram to helena the best wishes that can be forged in
 your thoughts be servants to you be comfortable
 to my mother your mistress and make much of her
lafeu farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of
 your father
 exeunt bertram and lafeu
helena o were that all i think not on my father
 and these great tears grace his remembrance more
 than those i shed for him what was he like
 i have forgot him my imagination
 carries no favour in't but bertram's
 i am undone there is no living none
 if bertram be away twere all one
 that i should love a bright particular star
 and think to wed it he is so above me
 in his bright radiance and collateral light
 must i be comforted not in his sphere
 the ambition in my love thus plagues itself
 the hind that would be mated by the lion
 must die for love twas pretty though plague
 to see him every hour to sit and draw
 his arched brows his hawking eye his curls
 in our heart's table heart too capable
 of every line and trick of his sweet favour
 but now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy
 must sanctify his reliques who comes here
 enter parolles
 aside
 one that goes with him i love him for his sake
 and yet i know him a notorious liar
 think him a great way fool solely a coward
 yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him
 that they take place when virtue's steely bones
 look bleak i the cold wind withal full oft we see
 cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
parolles save you fair queen
helena and you monarch
parolles no
helena and no
parolles are you meditating on virginity
helena ay you have some stain of soldier in you let me
 ask you a question man is enemy to virginity how
 may we barricado it against him
parolles keep him out
helena but he assails and our virginity though valiant
 in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some
 warlike resistance
parolles there is none man sitting down before you will
 undermine you and blow you up
helena bless our poor virginity from underminers and
 blowers up is there no military policy how
 virgins might blow up men
parolles virginity being blown down man will quicklier be
 blown up marry in blowing him down again with
 the breach yourselves made you lose your city it
 is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
 preserve virginity loss of virginity is rational
 increase and there was never virgin got till
 virginity was first lost that you were made of is
 metal to make virgins virginity by being once lost
 may be ten times found by being ever kept it is
 ever lost tis too cold a companion away with t
helena i will stand for t a little though therefore i die a virgin
parolles there's little can be said in t tis against the
 rule of nature to speak on the part of virginity
 is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible
 disobedience he that hangs himself is a virgin
 virginity murders itself and should be buried in
 highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
 offendress against nature virginity breeds mites
 much like a cheese consumes itself to the very
 paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach
 besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of
 selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the
 canon keep it not you cannot choose but loose
 by't out with t within ten year it will make
 itself ten which is a goodly increase and the
 principal itself not much the worse away with t
helena how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking
parolles let me see marry ill to like him that ne'er it
 likes tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
 lying the longer kept the less worth off with t
 while tis vendible answer the time of request
 virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out
 of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just
 like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not
 now your date is better in your pie and your
 porridge than in your cheek and your virginity
 your old virginity is like one of our french
 withered pears it looks ill it eats drily marry
 tis a withered pear it was formerly better
 marry yet tis a withered pear will you anything with it
helena not my virginity yet 
 there shall your master have a thousand loves
 a mother and a mistress and a friend
 a phoenix captain and an enemy
 a guide a goddess and a sovereign
 a counsellor a traitress and a dear
 his humble ambition proud humility
 his jarring concord and his discord dulcet
 his faith his sweet disaster with a world
 of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
 that blinking cupid gossips now shall he
 i know not what he shall god send him well
 the court's a learning place and he is one
parolles what one i faith
helena that i wish well tis pity
parolles what's pity
helena that wishing well had not a body in't
 which might be felt that we the poorer born
 whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
 might with effects of them follow our friends
 and show what we alone must think which never
 return us thanks
 enter page
page monsieur parolles my lord calls for you
 exit
parolles little helen farewell if i can remember thee i
 will think of thee at court
helena monsieur parolles you were born under a charitable star
parolles under mars i
helena i especially think under mars
parolles why under mars
helena the wars have so kept you under that you must needs
 be born under mars
parolles when he was predominant
helena when he was retrograde i think rather
parolles why think you so
helena you go so much backward when you fight
parolles that's for advantage
helena so is running away when fear proposes the safety
 but the composition that your valour and fear makes
 in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well
parolles i am so full of businesses i cannot answer thee
 acutely i will return perfect courtier in the
 which my instruction shall serve to naturalize
 thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
 counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
 thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and
 thine ignorance makes thee away farewell when
 thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast
 none remember thy friends get thee a good husband
 and use him as he uses thee so farewell
 exit
helena our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
 which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky
 gives us free scope only doth backward pull
 our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
 what power is it which mounts my love so high
 that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
 the mightiest space in fortune nature brings
 to join like likes and kiss like native things
 impossible be strange attempts to those
 that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
 what hath been cannot be who ever strove
 so show her merit that did miss her love
 the king's diseasemy project may deceive me
 but my intents are fix'd and will not leave me

scene ii paris the king's palace
 flourish of cornets enter the king of france
 with letters and divers attendants
king the florentines and senoys are by the ears
 have fought with equal fortune and continue
 a braving war
first lord so tis reported sir
king nay tis most credible we here received it
 a certainty vouch'd from our cousin austria
 with caution that the florentine will move us
 for speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
 prejudicates the business and would seem
 to have us make denial
first lord his love and wisdom
 approved so to your majesty may plead
 for amplest credence
king he hath arm'd our answer
 and florence is denied before he comes
 yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
 the tuscan service freely have they leave
 to stand on either part
second lord it well may serve
 a nursery to our gentry who are sick
 for breathing and exploit
king what's he comes here
 enter bertram lafeu and parolles
first lord it is the count rousillon my good lord
 young bertram
king youth thou bear'st thy father's face
 frank nature rather curious than in haste
 hath well composed thee thy father's moral parts
 mayst thou inherit too welcome to paris
bertram my thanks and duty are your majesty's
king i would i had that corporal soundness now
 as when thy father and myself in friendship
 first tried our soldiership he did look far
 into the service of the time and was
 discipled of the bravest he lasted long
 but on us both did haggish age steal on
 and wore us out of act it much repairs me
 to talk of your good father in his youth
 he had the wit which i can well observe
 today in our young lords but they may jest
 till their own scorn return to them unnoted
 ere they can hide their levity in honour
 so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
 were in his pride or sharpness if they were
 his equal had awaked them and his honour
 clock to itself knew the true minute when
 exception bid him speak and at this time
 his tongue obey'd his hand who were below him
 he used as creatures of another place
 and bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks
 making them proud of his humility
 in their poor praise he humbled such a man
 might be a copy to these younger times
 which follow'd well would demonstrate them now
 but goers backward
bertram his good remembrance sir
 lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb
 so in approof lives not his epitaph
 as in your royal speech
king would i were with him he would always say
 methinks i hear him now his plausive words
 he scatter'd not in ears but grafted them
 to grow there and to bear'let me not live'
 this his good melancholy oft began
 on the catastrophe and heel of pastime
 when it was out'let me not live quoth he
 after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff
 of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
 all but new things disdain whose judgments are
 mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
 expire before their fashions this he wish'd
 i after him do after him wish too
 since i nor wax nor honey can bring home
 i quickly were dissolved from my hive
 to give some labourers room
second lord you are loved sir
 they that least lend it you shall lack you first
king i fill a place i know't how long is't count
 since the physician at your father's died
 he was much famed
bertram some six months since my lord
king if he were living i would try him yet
 lend me an arm the rest have worn me out
 with several applications nature and sickness
 debate it at their leisure welcome count
 my son's no dearer
bertram thank your majesty

 of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh
 and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my
 flesh and blood is my friend ergo he that kisses

 be what they are there were no fear in marriage
 for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the

 she wished me alone she was and did communicate
 to herself her own words to her own ears she
 thought i dare vow for her they touched not any
 stranger sense her matter was she loved your son
 fortune she said was no goddess that had put
 such difference betwixt their two estates love no
 god that would not extend his might only where
 qualities were level dian no queen of virgins that
 would suffer her poor knight surprised without
 rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward

 sorrow that e'er i heard virgin exclaim in which i
 held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal

 exit steward
 enter helena
 even so it was with me when i was young
 if ever we are nature's these are ours this thorn
 doth to our rose of youth rightly belong
 our blood to us this to our blood is born
 it is the show and seal of nature's truth
 where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth
 by our remembrances of days foregone
 such were our faults or then we thought them none
 her eye is sick on't i observe her now
helena what is your pleasure madam
countess you know helen
 i am a mother to you
helena mine honourable mistress
countess nay a mother
 why not a mother when i said a mother'
 methought you saw a serpent what's in mother'
 that you start at it i say i am your mother
 and put you in the catalogue of those
 that were enwombed mine tis often seen
 adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
 a native slip to us from foreign seeds
 you ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan
 yet i express to you a mother's care
 god's mercy maiden does it curd thy blood
 to say i am thy mother what's the matter
 that this distemper'd messenger of wet
 the manycolour'd iris rounds thine eye
 why that you are my daughter
helena that i am not
countess i say i am your mother
helena pardon madam
 the count rousillon cannot be my brother
 i am from humble he from honour'd name
 no note upon my parents his all noble
 my master my dear lord he is and i
 his servant live and will his vassal die
 he must not be my brother
countess nor i your mother
helena you are my mother madam would you were
 so that my lord your son were not my brother
 indeed my mother or were you both our mothers
 i care no more for than i do for heaven
 so i were not his sister can't no other
 but i your daughter he must be my brother
countess yes helen you might be my daughterinlaw
 god shield you mean it not daughter and mother
 so strive upon your pulse what pale again
 my fear hath catch'd your fondness now i see
 the mystery of your loneliness and find
 your salt tears head now to all sense tis gross
 you love my son invention is ashamed
 against the proclamation of thy passion
 to say thou dost not therefore tell me true
 but tell me then tis so for look thy cheeks
 confess it th one to th other and thine eyes
 see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
 that in their kind they speak it only sin
 and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
 that truth should be suspected speak is't so
 if it be so you have wound a goodly clew
 if it be not forswear't howe'er i charge thee
 as heaven shall work in me for thine avail
 tell me truly
helena good madam pardon me
countess do you love my son

countess love you my son
helena do not you love him madam
countess go not about my love hath in't a bond
 whereof the world takes note come come disclose
 the state of your affection for your passions

helena then i confess
 here on my knee before high heaven and you
 that before you and next unto high heaven
 i love your son
 my friends were poor but honest so's my love
 be not offended for it hurts not him
 that he is loved of me i follow him not
 by any token of presumptuous suit
 nor would i have him till i do deserve him
 yet never know how that desert should be
 i know i love in vain strive against hope
 yet in this captious and intenible sieve
 i still pour in the waters of my love
 and lack not to lose still thus indianlike
 religious in mine error i adore
 the sun that looks upon his worshipper
 but knows of him no more my dearest madam
 let not your hate encounter with my love
 for loving where you do but if yourself
 whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth
 did ever in so true a flame of liking
 wish chastely and love dearly that your dian
 was both herself and love o then give pity
 to her whose state is such that cannot choose
 but lend and give where she is sure to lose
 that seeks not to find that her search implies
 but riddlelike lives sweetly where she dies
countess had you not lately an intentspeak truly
 to go to paris
helena madam i had
countess wherefore tell true
helena i will tell truth by grace itself i swear
 you know my father left me some prescriptions
 of rare and proved effects such as his reading
 and manifest experience had collected
 for general sovereignty and that he will'd me
 in heedfull'st reservation to bestow them
 as notes whose faculties inclusive were
 more than they were in note amongst the rest
 there is a remedy approved set down
 to cure the desperate languishings whereof
 the king is render'd lost
countess this was your motive
 for paris was it speak
helena my lord your son made me to think of this
 else paris and the medicine and the king
 had from the conversation of my thoughts
 haply been absent then
countess but think you helen
 if you should tender your supposed aid
 he would receive it he and his physicians
 are of a mind he that they cannot help him
 they that they cannot help how shall they credit
 a poor unlearned virgin when the schools
 embowell'd of their doctrine have left off
 the danger to itself
helena there's something in't
 more than my father's skill which was the greatest
 of his profession that his good receipt
 shall for my legacy be sanctified
 by the luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour
 but give me leave to try success i'ld venture
 the welllost life of mine on his grace's cure
 by such a day and hour
countess dost thou believe't
helena ay madam knowingly
countess why helen thou shalt have my leave and love
 means and attendants and my loving greetings
 to those of mine in court i'll stay at home
 and pray god's blessing into thy attempt
 be gone tomorrow and be sure of this
 what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss

 time there do muster true gait eat speak and
 move under the influence of the most received star
 and though the devil lead the measure such are to
 be followed after them and take a more dilated farewell
bertram and i will do so
parolles worthy fellows and like to prove most sinewy swordmen
 exeunt bertram and parolles
 enter lafeu
lafeu kneeling pardon my lord for me and for my tidings
king i'll fee thee to stand up
lafeu then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon
 i would you had kneel'd my lord to ask me mercy
 and that at my bidding you could so stand up
king i would i had so i had broke thy pate
 and ask'd thee mercy for't
lafeu good faith across but my good lord tis thus
 will you be cured of your infirmity
king no
lafeu o will you eat no grapes my royal fox
 yes but you will my noble grapes an if
 my royal fox could reach them i have seen a medicine
 that's able to breathe life into a stone
 quicken a rock and make you dance canary
 with spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
 is powerful to araise king pepin nay
 to give great charlemain a pen in's hand
 and write to her a loveline
king what her is this
lafeu why doctor she my lord there's one arrived
 if you will see her now by my faith and honour
 if seriously i may convey my thoughts
 in this my light deliverance i have spoke
 with one that in her sex her years profession
 wisdom and constancy hath amazed me more
 than i dare blame my weakness will you see her
 for that is her demand and know her business
 that done laugh well at me
king now good lafeu
 bring in the admiration that we with thee
 may spend our wonder too or take off thine
 by wondering how thou took'st it
lafeu nay i'll fit you
 and not be all day neither
 exit
king thus he his special nothing ever prologues
 reenter lafeu with helena
lafeu nay come your ways
king this haste hath wings indeed
lafeu nay come your ways
 this is his majesty say your mind to him
 a traitor you do look like but such traitors
 his majesty seldom fears i am cressid's uncle
 that dare leave two together fare you well
 exit
king now fair one does your business follow us
helena ay my good lord
 gerard de narbon was my father
 in what he did profess well found
king i knew him
helena the rather will i spare my praises towards him
 knowing him is enough on's bed of death
 many receipts he gave me chiefly one
 which as the dearest issue of his practise
 and of his old experience the oily darling
 he bade me store up as a triple eye
 safer than mine own two more dear i have so
 and hearing your high majesty is touch'd
 with that malignant cause wherein the honour
 of my dear father's gift stands chief in power
 i come to tender it and my appliance
 with all bound humbleness
king we thank you maiden
 but may not be so credulous of cure
 when our most learned doctors leave us and
 the congregated college have concluded
 that labouring art can never ransom nature
 from her inaidible estate i say we must not
 so stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
 to prostitute our pastcure malady
 to empirics or to dissever so
 our great self and our credit to esteem
 a senseless help when help past sense we deem
helena my duty then shall pay me for my pains
 i will no more enforce mine office on you
 humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
 a modest one to bear me back a again
king i cannot give thee less to be call'd grateful
 thou thought'st to help me and such thanks i give
 as one near death to those that wish him live
 but what at full i know thou know'st no part
 i knowing all my peril thou no art
helena what i can do can do no hurt to try
 since you set up your rest gainst remedy
 he that of greatest works is finisher
 oft does them by the weakest minister
 so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
 when judges have been babes great floods have flown
 from simple sources and great seas have dried
 when miracles have by the greatest been denied
 oft expectation fails and most oft there
 where most it promises and oft it hits
 where hope is coldest and despair most fits
king i must not hear thee fare thee well kind maid
 thy pains not used must by thyself be paid
 proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
helena inspired merit so by breath is barr'd
 it is not so with him that all things knows
 as tis with us that square our guess by shows
 but most it is presumption in us when

 traduced by odious ballads my maiden's name
 sear'd otherwise nay worseif worseextended

king methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
 his powerful sound within an organ weak
 and what impossibility would slay
 in common sense sense saves another way
 thy life is dear for all that life can rate

 skill infinite or monstrous desperate
 sweet practiser thy physic i will try
 that ministers thine own death if i die
helena if i break time or flinch in property
 of what i spoke unpitied let me die

 but if i help what do you promise me
king make thy demand
helena but will you make it even
king ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven
helena then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
 what husband in thy power i will command
 exempted be from me the arrogance
 to choose from forth the royal blood of france
 my low and humble name to propagate
 with any branch or image of thy state
 but such a one thy vassal whom i know
 is free for me to ask thee to bestow
king here is my hand the premises observed
 thy will by my performance shall be served
 so make the choice of thy own time for i
 thy resolved patient on thee still rely
 more should i question thee and more i must
 though more to know could not be more to trust
 from whence thou camest how tended on but rest
 unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest
 give me some help here ho if thou proceed
 as high as word my deed shall match thy meed

act ii
scene ii rousillon the count's palace
 enter countess and clown
countess come on sir i shall now put you to the height of
 your breeding
clown i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught i
 know my business is but to the court
countess to the court why what place make you special
 when you put off that with such contempt but to the court
clown truly madam if god have lent a man any manners he
 may easily put it off at court he that cannot make
 a leg put off's cap kiss his hand and say nothing

 such a fellow to say precisely were not for the
 court but for me i have an answer will serve all
 men

 questions
clown it is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks
 the pinbuttock the quatchbuttock the brawn
 buttock or any buttock
countess will your answer serve fit to all questions
clown as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney
 as your french crown for your taffeta punk as tib's
 rush for tom's forefinger as a pancake for shrove
 tuesday a morris for mayday as the nail to his
 hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding queen
 to a wrangling knave as the nun's lip to the
 friar's mouth nay as the pudding to his skin
countess have you i say an answer of such fitness for all
 questions
clown from below your duke to beneath your constable it
 will fit any question
countess it must be an answer of most monstrous size that
 must fit all demands
clown but a trifle neither in good faith if the learned
 should speak truth of it here it is and all that
 belongs to't ask me if i am a courtier it shall
 do you no harm to learn
countess to be young again if we could i will be a fool in
 question hoping to be the wiser by your answer i
 pray you sir are you a courtier
clown o lord sir there's a simple putting off more
 more a hundred of them
countess sir i am a poor friend of yours that loves you
clown o lord sir thick thick spare not me
countess i think sir you can eat none of this homely meat
clown o lord sir nay put me to't i warrant you
countess you were lately whipped sir as i think
clown o lord sir spare not me
countess do you cry o lord sir at your whipping and
 spare not me indeed your o lord sir is very
 sequent to your whipping you would answer very well
 to a whipping if you were but bound to't
clown i ne'er had worse luck in my life in my o lord
 sir i see things may serve long but not serve ever
countess i play the noble housewife with the time
 to entertain't so merrily with a fool
clown o lord sir why there't serves well again
countess an end sir to your business give helen this
 and urge her to a present answer back
 commend me to my kinsmen and my son
 this is not much
clown not much commendation to them
countess not much employment for you you understand me
clown most fruitfully i am there before my legs
countess haste you again

act ii
scene iii paris the king's palace
 enter bertram lafeu and parolles
lafeu they say miracles are past and we have our
 philosophical persons to make modern and familiar
 things supernatural and causeless hence is it that
 we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves
 into seeming knowledge when we should submit
 ourselves to an unknown fear
parolles why tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
 shot out in our latter times
bertram and so tis
lafeu to be relinquish'd of the artists
parolles so i say
lafeu both of galen and paracelsus
parolles so i say
lafeu of all the learned and authentic fellows
parolles right so i say
lafeu that gave him out incurable
parolles why there tis so say i too
lafeu not to be helped
parolles right as twere a man assured of a
lafeu uncertain life and sure death
parolles just you say well so would i have said
lafeu i may truly say it is a novelty to the world
parolles it is indeed if you will have it in showing you
 shall read it inwhat do you call there
lafeu a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor
parolles that's it i would have said the very same
lafeu why your dolphin is not lustier fore me
 i speak in respect
parolles nay tis strange tis very strange that is the
 brief and the tedious of it and he's of a most
 facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the
lafeu very hand of heaven
parolles ay so i say
lafeu in a most weak
 pausing
 and debile minister great power great
 transcendence which should indeed give us a
 further use to be made than alone the recovery of
 the king as to be
 pausing
 generally thankful
parolles i would have said it you say well here comes the king
 enter king helena and attendants lafeu and
 parolles retire
lafeu lustig as the dutchman says i'll like a maid the
 better whilst i have a tooth in my head why he's
 able to lead her a coranto
parolles mort du vinaigre is not this helen
lafeu fore god i think so
king go call before me all the lords in court
 sit my preserver by thy patient's side
 and with this healthful hand whose banish'd sense
 thou hast repeal'd a second time receive
 the confirmation of my promised gift
 which but attends thy naming
 enter three or four lords
 fair maid send forth thine eye this youthful parcel
 of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing
 o'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
 i have to use thy frank election make
 thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake
helena to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
 fall when love please marry to each but one
lafeu i'ld give bay curtal and his furniture
 my mouth no more were broken than these boys'
 and writ as little beard
king peruse them well
 not one of those but had a noble father
helena gentlemen
 heaven hath through me restored the king to health
all we understand it and thank heaven for you
helena i am a simple maid and therein wealthiest
 that i protest i simply am a maid
 please it your majesty i have done already
 the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me
 we blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused
 let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever
 we'll ne'er come there again'
king make choice and see
 who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me
helena now dian from thy altar do i fly
 and to imperial love that god most high
 do my sighs stream sir will you hear my suit
first lord and grant it
helena thanks sir all the rest is mute
lafeu i had rather be in this choice than throw amesace
 for my life
helena the honour sir that flames in your fair eyes
 before i speak too threateningly replies
 love make your fortunes twenty times above
 her that so wishes and her humble love
second lord no better if you please
helena my wish receive
 which great love grant and so i take my leave
lafeu do all they deny her an they were sons of mine
 i'd have them whipped or i would send them to the
 turk to make eunuchs of
helena be not afraid that i your hand should take
 i'll never do you wrong for your own sake
 blessing upon your vows and in your bed
 find fairer fortune if you ever wed
lafeu these boys are boys of ice they'll none have her
 sure they are bastards to the english the french
 ne'er got em
helena you are too young too happy and too good
 to make yourself a son out of my blood
fourth lord fair one i think not so
lafeu there's one grape yet i am sure thy father drunk
 wine but if thou be'st not an ass i am a youth
 of fourteen i have known thee already
helena to bertram i dare not say i take you but i give
 me and my service ever whilst i live
 into your guiding power this is the man
king why then young bertram take her she's thy wife
bertram my wife my liege i shall beseech your highness
 in such a business give me leave to use
 the help of mine own eyes
king know'st thou not bertram
 what she has done for me
bertram yes my good lord
 but never hope to know why i should marry her
king thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed
bertram but follows it my lord to bring me down
 must answer for your raising i know her well
 she had her breeding at my father's charge
 a poor physician's daughter my wife disdain
 rather corrupt me ever
king tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which
 i can build up strange is it that our bloods
 of colour weight and heat pour'd all together
 would quite confound distinction yet stand off
 in differences so mighty if she be
 all that is virtuous save what thou dislikest
 a poor physician's daughter thou dislikest
 of virtue for the name but do not so
 from lowest place when virtuous things proceed
 the place is dignified by the doer's deed
 where great additions swell's and virtue none
 it is a dropsied honour good alone
 is good without a name vileness is so
 the property by what it is should go
 not by the title she is young wise fair
 in these to nature she's immediate heir
 and these breed honour that is honour's scorn
 which challenges itself as honour's born
 and is not like the sire honours thrive
 when rather from our acts we them derive
 than our foregoers the mere word's a slave
 debosh'd on every tomb on every grave
 a lying trophy and as oft is dumb
 where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
 of honour'd bones indeed what should be said
 if thou canst like this creature as a maid
 i can create the rest virtue and she
 is her own dower honour and wealth from me
bertram i cannot love her nor will strive to do't
king thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose
helena that you are well restored my lord i'm glad
 let the rest go
king my honour's at the stake which to defeat
 i must produce my power here take her hand
 proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
 that dost in vile misprision shackle up
 my love and her desert that canst not dream
 we poising us in her defective scale
 shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
 it is in us to plant thine honour where
 we please to have it grow cheque thy contempt
 obey our will which travails in thy good
 believe not thy disdain but presently
 do thine own fortunes that obedient right
 which both thy duty owes and our power claims
 or i will throw thee from my care for ever
 into the staggers and the careless lapse
 of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
 loosing upon thee in the name of justice
 without all terms of pity speak thine answer
bertram pardon my gracious lord for i submit
 my fancy to your eyes when i consider
 what great creation and what dole of honour
 flies where you bid it i find that she which late
 was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
 the praised of the king who so ennobled
 is as twere born so
king take her by the hand
 and tell her she is thine to whom i promise
 a counterpoise if not to thy estate
 a balance more replete
bertram i take her hand
king good fortune and the favour of the king
 smile upon this contract whose ceremony
 shall seem expedient on the nowborn brief
 and be perform'd tonight the solemn feast
 shall more attend upon the coming space
 expecting absent friends as thou lovest her
 thy love's to me religious else does err
 exeunt all but lafeu and parolles
lafeu advancing do you hear monsieur a word with you

parolles what i dare too well do i dare not do
lafeu i did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty
 wise fellow thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
 travel it might pass yet the scarfs and the
 bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
 believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen i
 have now found thee when i lose thee again i care
 not yet art thou good for nothing but taking up and

 bate thee a scruple

lafeu even as soon as thou canst for thou hast to pull at
 a smack o the contrary if ever thou be'st bound
 in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find what it is
 to be proud of thy bondage i have a desire to hold
 my acquaintance with thee or rather my knowledge
 that i may say in the default he is a man i know
parolles my lord you do me most insupportable vexation

 thy lower part where thy nose stands by mine
 honour if i were but two hours younger i'ld beat
 thee methinks thou art a general offence and
 every man should beat thee i think thou wast
 created for men to breathe themselves upon thee
parolles this is hard and undeserved measure my lord
lafeu go to sir you were beaten in italy for picking a
 kernel out of a pomegranate you are a vagabond and
 no true traveller you are more saucy with lords
 and honourable personages than the commission of your
 birth and virtue gives you heraldry you are not
 worth another word else i'ld call you knave i leave you

 i know not yet
parolles ay that would be known to the wars my boy to the wars
 he wears his honour in a box unseen
 that hugs his kickywicky here at home
 spending his manly marrow in her arms
 which should sustain the bound and high curvet
 of mars's fiery steed to other regions
 france is a stable we that dwell in't jades
 therefore to the war
bertram it shall be so i'll send her to my house
 acquaint my mother with my hate to her

 world's pleasure and the increase of laughter
parolles a good knave i faith and well fed
 madam my lord will go away tonight
 a very serious business calls on him
 the great prerogative and rite of love
 which as your due time claims he does acknowledge
 but puts it off to a compell'd restraint
 whose want and whose delay is strew'd with sweets
 which they distil now in the curbed time
 to make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
 and pleasure drown the brim
helena what's his will else
parolles that you will take your instant leave o the king
 and make this haste as your own good proceeding
 strengthen'd with what apology you think

 greater than shows itself at the first view
 to you that know them not this to my mother

 that the great figure of a council frames
 by selfunable motion therefore dare not
 say what i think of it since i have found
 myself in my incertain grounds to fail

duke be it his pleasure

 for the contempt of empire
 reenter clown
clown o madam yonder is heavy news within between two
 soldiers and my young lady

 comfort your son will not be killed so soon as i
 thought he would

first gentleman ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed
helena reads till i have no wife i have nothing in france

helena ay madam
first gentleman tis but the boldness of his hand haply which his
 heart was not consenting to
countess nothing in france until he have no wife

countess parolles was it not
first gentleman ay my good lady he
countess a very tainted fellow and full of wickedness

countess alas and would you take the letter of her
 might you not know she would do as she has done
 by sending me a letter read it again
steward reads
 i am saint jaques pilgrim thither gone
 ambitious love hath so in me offended
 that barefoot plod i the cold ground upon
 with sainted vow my faults to have amended
 write write that from the bloody course of war
 my dearest master your dear son may hie
 bless him at home in peace whilst i from far
 his name with zealous fervor sanctify
 his taken labours bid him me forgive
 i his despiteful juno sent him forth
 from courtly friends with camping foes to live
 where death and danger dogs the heels of worth
 he is too good and fair for death and me
 whom i myself embrace to set him free
countess ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words
 rinaldo you did never lack advice so much
 as letting her pass so had i spoke with her
 i could have well diverted her intents
 which thus she hath prevented
steward pardon me madam
 if i had given you this at overnight
 she might have been o'erta'en and yet she writes
 pursuit would be but vain
countess what angel shall
 bless this unworthy husband he cannot thrive
 unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear
 and loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath
 of greatest justice write write rinaldo
 to this unworthy husband of his wife
 let every word weigh heavy of her worth
 that he does weigh too light my greatest grief
 though little he do feel it set down sharply
 dispatch the most convenient messenger
 when haply he shall hear that she is gone
 he will return and hope i may that she
 hearing so much will speed her foot again
 led hither by pure love which of them both
 is dearest to me i have no skill in sense
 to make distinction provide this messenger
 my heart is heavy and mine age is weak
 grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak

scene vi camp before florence
 enter bertram and the two french lords
second lord nay good my lord put him to't let him have his
 way
first lord if your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no
 more in your respect
second lord on my life my lord a bubble
bertram do you think i am so far deceived in him
second lord believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge
 without any malice but to speak of him as my
 kinsman he's a most notable coward an infinite and
 endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner
 of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
 entertainment
first lord it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in
 his virtue which he hath not he might at some
 great and trusty business in a main danger fail you
bertram i would i knew in what particular action to try him
first lord none better than to let him fetch off his drum
 which you hear him so confidently undertake to do
second lord i with a troop of florentines will suddenly
 surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he
 knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink
 him so that he shall suppose no other but that he
 is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
 we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship
 present at his examination if he do not for the
 promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
 base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the
 intelligence in his power against you and that with
 the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never
 trust my judgment in any thing
first lord o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum
 he says he has a stratagem for't when your
 lordship sees the bottom of his success in't and to
 what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
 melted if you give him not john drum's
 entertainment your inclining cannot be removed
 here he comes
 enter parolles
second lord aside to bertram o for the love of laughter
 hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch
 off his drum in any hand
bertram how now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your
 disposition
first lord a pox on't let it go tis but a drum
parolles but a drum is't but a drum a drum so lost
 there was excellent commandto charge in with our
 horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers
first lord that was not to be blamed in the command of the
 service it was a disaster of war that caesar
 himself could not have prevented if he had been
 there to command
bertram well we cannot greatly condemn our success some
 dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is
 not to be recovered
parolles it might have been recovered
bertram it might but it is not now
parolles it is to be recovered but that the merit of
 service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
 performer i would have that drum or another or
 hic jacet'
bertram why if you have a stomach to't monsieur if you
 think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
 instrument of honour again into his native quarter
 be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will
 grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you
 speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it
 and extend to you what further becomes his
 greatness even to the utmost syllable of your
 worthiness
parolles by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it
bertram but you must not now slumber in it
parolles i'll about it this evening and i will presently
 pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my
 certainty put myself into my mortal preparation
 and by midnight look to hear further from me
bertram may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it
parolles i know not what the success will be my lord but
 the attempt i vow
bertram i know thou'rt valiant and to the possibility of
 thy soldiership will subscribe for thee farewell
parolles i love not many words
 exit
second lord no more than a fish loves water is not this a
 strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems
 to undertake this business which he knows is not to
 be done damns himself to do and dares better be
 damned than to do't
first lord you do not know him my lord as we do certain it
 is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
 for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but
 when you find him out you have him ever after
bertram why do you think he will make no deed at all of
 this that so seriously he does address himself unto
second lord none in the world but return with an invention and
 clap upon you two or three probable lies but we
 have almost embossed him you shall see his fall
 tonight for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect
first lord we'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
 him he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu
 when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a
 sprat you shall find him which you shall see this
 very night
second lord i must go look my twigs he shall be caught
bertram your brother he shall go along with me
second lord as't please your lordship i'll leave you
 exit
bertram now will i lead you to the house and show you
 the lass i spoke of
first lord but you say she's honest
bertram that's all the fault i spoke with her but once
 and found her wondrous cold but i sent to her
 by this same coxcomb that we have i the wind
 tokens and letters which she did resend
 and this is all i have done she's a fair creature
 will you go see her
first lord with all my heart my lord
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well
act iii
scene vii florence the widow's house
 enter helena and widow
helena if you misdoubt me that i am not she
 i know not how i shall assure you further
 but i shall lose the grounds i work upon
widow though my estate be fallen i was well born
 nothing acquainted with these businesses
 and would not put my reputation now
 in any staining act
helena nor would i wish you
 first give me trust the count he is my husband
 and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken
 is so from word to word and then you cannot
 by the good aid that i of you shall borrow
 err in bestowing it
widow i should believe you
 for you have show'd me that which well approves
 you're great in fortune
helena take this purse of gold
 and let me buy your friendly help thus far
 which i will overpay and pay again
 when i have found it the count he wooes your daughter
 lays down his wanton siege before her beauty
 resolved to carry her let her in fine consent
 as we'll direct her how tis best to bear it
 now his important blood will nought deny
 that she'll demand a ring the county wears
 that downward hath succeeded in his house
 from son to son some four or five descents
 since the first father wore it this ring he holds
 in most rich choice yet in his idle fire
 to buy his will it would not seem too dear
 howe'er repented after
widow now i see
 the bottom of your purpose
helena you see it lawful then it is no more
 but that your daughter ere she seems as won
 desires this ring appoints him an encounter
 in fine delivers me to fill the time
 herself most chastely absent after this
 to marry her i'll add three thousand crowns
 to what is passed already
widow i have yielded
 instruct my daughter how she shall persever
 that time and place with this deceit so lawful
 may prove coherent every night he comes
 with musics of all sorts and songs composed
 to her unworthiness it nothing steads us
 to chide him from our eaves for he persists
 as if his life lay on't
helena why then tonight
 let us assay our plot which if it speed
 is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
 and lawful meaning in a lawful act
 where both not sin and yet a sinful fact
 but let's about it
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well
act iv
scene i without the florentine camp
 enter second french lord with five or six other
 soldiers in ambush
second lord he can come no other way but by this hedgecorner
 when you sally upon him speak what terrible
 language you will though you understand it not
 yourselves no matter for we must not seem to
 understand him unless some one among us whom we
 must produce for an interpreter
first soldier good captain let me be the interpreter
second lord art not acquainted with him knows he not thy voice
first soldier no sir i warrant you
second lord but what linseywoolsey hast thou to speak to us again
first soldier e'en such as you speak to me
second lord he must think us some band of strangers i the
 adversary's entertainment now he hath a smack of
 all neighbouring languages therefore we must every
 one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we
 speak one to another so we seem to know is to
 know straight our purpose choughs language
 gabble enough and good enough as for you
 interpreter you must seem very politic but couch
 ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep
 and then to return and swear the lies he forges
 enter parolles
parolles ten o'clock within these three hours twill be
 time enough to go home what shall i say i have
 done it must be a very plausive invention that
 carries it they begin to smoke me and disgraces
 have of late knocked too often at my door i find
 my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the
 fear of mars before it and of his creatures not
 daring the reports of my tongue
second lord this is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
 was guilty of
parolles what the devil should move me to undertake the
 recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the
 impossibility and knowing i had no such purpose i
 must give myself some hurts and say i got them in
 exploit yet slight ones will not carry it they
 will say came you off with so little and great
 ones i dare not give wherefore what's the
 instance tongue i must put you into a
 butterwoman's mouth and buy myself another of
 bajazet's mule if you prattle me into these perils
second lord is it possible he should know what he is and be
 that he is
parolles i would the cutting of my garments would serve the
 turn or the breaking of my spanish sword
second lord we cannot afford you so
parolles or the baring of my beard and to say it was in
 stratagem
second lord twould not do
parolles or to drown my clothes and say i was stripped
second lord hardly serve
parolles though i swore i leaped from the window of the citadel
second lord how deep
parolles thirty fathom
second lord three great oaths would scarce make that be believed
parolles i would i had any drum of the enemy's i would swear
 i recovered it
second lord you shall hear one anon
parolles a drum now of the enemy's
 alarum within
second lord throca movousus cargo cargo cargo
all cargo cargo cargo villiando par corbo cargo
parolles o ransom ransom do not hide mine eyes

 if there be here german or dane low dutch
 italian or french let him speak to me i'll
 discover that which shall undo the florentine
first soldier boskos vauvado i understand thee and can speak
 thy tongue kerely bonto sir betake thee to thy
 faith for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom
parolles o

second lord oscorbidulchos volivorco
first soldier the general is content to spare thee yet
 and hoodwink'd as thou art will lead thee on
 to gather from thee haply thou mayst inform
 something to save thy life
parolles o let me live
 and all the secrets of our camp i'll show
 their force their purposes nay i'll speak that
 which you will wonder at
first soldier but wilt thou faithfully
parolles if i do not damn me
first soldier acordo linta

 till we do hear from them
second soldier captain i will

act iv
scene ii florence the widow's house
 enter bertram and diana
bertram they told me that your name was fontibell
diana no my good lord diana
bertram titled goddess
 and worth it with addition but fair soul
 in your fine frame hath love no quality
 if quick fire of youth light not your mind
 you are no maiden but a monument
 when you are dead you should be such a one
 as you are now for you are cold and stem
 and now you should be as your mother was
 when your sweet self was got
diana she then was honest
bertram so should you be
diana no
 my mother did but duty such my lord
 as you owe to your wife
bertram no more o that
 i prithee do not strive against my vows
 i was compell'd to her but i love thee
 by love's own sweet constraint and will for ever
 do thee all rights of service
diana ay so you serve us
 till we serve you but when you have our roses
 you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
 and mock us with our bareness
bertram how have i sworn
diana tis not the many oaths that makes the truth
 but the plain single vow that is vow'd true
 what is not holy that we swear not by
 but take the high'st to witness then pray you tell me
 if i should swear by god's great attributes
 i loved you dearly would you believe my oaths
 when i did love you ill this has no holding
 to swear by him whom i protest to love
 that i will work against him therefore your oaths
 are words and poor conditions but unseal'd
 at least in my opinion
bertram change it change it
 be not so holycruel love is holy
 and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
 that you do charge men with stand no more off
 but give thyself unto my sick desires
 who then recover say thou art mine and ever
 my love as it begins shall so persever
diana i see that men make ropes in such a scarre
 that we'll forsake ourselves give me that ring
bertram i'll lend it thee my dear but have no power
 to give it from me
diana will you not my lord
bertram it is an honour longing to our house
 bequeathed down from many ancestors
 which were the greatest obloquy i the world
 in me to lose
diana mine honour's such a ring
 my chastity's the jewel of our house
 bequeathed down from many ancestors
 which were the greatest obloquy i the world
 in me to lose thus your own proper wisdom
 brings in the champion honour on my part
 against your vain assault
bertram here take my ring
 my house mine honour yea my life be thine
 and i'll be bid by thee
diana when midnight comes knock at my chamberwindow
 i'll order take my mother shall not hear
 now will i charge you in the band of truth
 when you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed
 remain there but an hour nor speak to me
 my reasons are most strong and you shall know them
 when back again this ring shall be deliver'd
 and on your finger in the night i'll put
 another ring that what in time proceeds
 may token to the future our past deeds
 adieu till then then fail not you have won
 a wife of me though there my hope be done
bertram a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee
 exit
diana for which live long to thank both heaven and me
 you may so in the end
 my mother told me just how he would woo
 as if she sat in s heart she says all men
 have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me
 when his wife's dead therefore i'll lie with him
 when i am buried since frenchmen are so braid
 marry that will i live and die a maid
 only in this disguise i think't no sin
 to cozen him that would unjustly win
 exit
 all's well that ends well
act iv
scene iii the florentine camp
 enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers
first lord you have not given him his mother's letter
second lord i have delivered it an hour since there is
 something in't that stings his nature for on the
 reading it he changed almost into another man
first lord he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
 off so good a wife and so sweet a lady
second lord especially he hath incurred the everlasting
 displeasure of the king who had even tuned his
 bounty to sing happiness to him i will tell you a
 thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you
first lord when you have spoken it tis dead and i am the
 grave of it
second lord he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
 florence of a most chaste renown and this night he
 fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath
 given her his monumental ring and thinks himself
 made in the unchaste composition
first lord now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves
 what things are we
second lord merely our own traitors and as in the common course
 of all treasons we still see them reveal
 themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends
 so he that in this action contrives against his own
 nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himself
first lord is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of
 our unlawful intents we shall not then have his
 company tonight
second lord not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
first lord that approaches apace i would gladly have him see
 his company anatomized that he might take a measure
 of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had
 set this counterfeit
second lord we will not meddle with him till he come for his
 presence must be the whip of the other
first lord in the mean time what hear you of these wars
second lord i hear there is an overture of peace
first lord nay i assure you a peace concluded
second lord what will count rousillon do then will he travel
 higher or return again into france
first lord i perceive by this demand you are not altogether
 of his council
second lord let it be forbid sir so should i be a great deal
 of his act
first lord sir his wife some two months since fled from his
 house her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques
 le grand which holy undertaking with most austere
 sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the
 tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
 grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and
 now she sings in heaven
second lord how is this justified
first lord the stronger part of it by her own letters which
 makes her story true even to the point of her
 death her death itself which could not be her
 office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by
 the rector of the place
second lord hath the count all this intelligence
first lord ay and the particular confirmations point from
 point so to the full arming of the verity
second lord i am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this
first lord how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses
second lord and how mightily some other times we drown our gain
 in tears the great dignity that his valour hath
 here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
 with a shame as ample
first lord the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and
 ill together our virtues would be proud if our
 faults whipped them not and our crimes would
 despair if they were not cherished by our virtues
 enter a messenger
 how now where's your master
servant he met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath
 taken a solemn leave his lordship will next
 morning for france the duke hath offered him
 letters of commendations to the king
second lord they shall be no more than needful there if they
 were more than they can commend
first lord they cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness
 here's his lordship now
 enter bertram
 how now my lord is't not after midnight
bertram i have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses a
 month's length apiece by an abstract of success
 i have congied with the duke done my adieu with his
 nearest buried a wife mourned for her writ to my
 lady mother i am returning entertained my convoy
 and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
 many nicer needs the last was the greatest but
 that i have not ended yet
second lord if the business be of any difficulty and this
 morning your departure hence it requires haste of
 your lordship
bertram i mean the business is not ended as fearing to
 hear of it hereafter but shall we have this
 dialogue between the fool and the soldier come
 bring forth this counterfeit module he has deceived
 me like a doublemeaning prophesier
second lord bring him forth has sat i the stocks all night
 poor gallant knave
bertram no matter his heels have deserved it in usurping
 his spurs so long how does he carry himself
second lord i have told your lordship already the stocks carry
 him but to answer you as you would be understood
 he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he
 hath confessed himself to morgan whom he supposes
 to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to
 this very instant disaster of his setting i the
 stocks and what think you he hath confessed
bertram nothing of me has a'
second lord his confession is taken and it shall be read to his
 face if your lordship be in't as i believe you
 are you must have the patience to hear it
 enter parolles guarded and first soldier
bertram a plague upon him muffled he can say nothing of
 me hush hush
first lord hoodman comes portotartarosa
first soldier he calls for the tortures what will you say
 without em
parolles i will confess what i know without constraint if
 ye pinch me like a pasty i can say no more
first soldier bosko chimurcho

parolles and truly as i hope to live
first soldier reads first demand of him how many horse the
 duke is strong what say you to that
parolles five or six thousand but very weak and
 unserviceable the troops are all scattered and
 the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation
 and credit and as i hope to live
first soldier shall i set down your answer so
parolles do i'll take the sacrament on't how and which way you will
bertram all's one to him what a pastsaving slave is this
first lord you're deceived my lord this is monsieur
 parolles the gallant militaristthat was his own
 phrasethat had the whole theoric of war in the
 knot of his scarf and the practise in the chape of
 his dagger
second lord i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
 clean nor believe he can have every thing in him
 by wearing his apparel neatly
first soldier well that's set down
parolles five or six thousand horse i said i will say
 trueor thereabouts set down for i'll speak truth
first lord he's very near the truth in this
bertram but i con him no thanks for't in the nature he
 delivers it
parolles poor rogues i pray you say
first soldier well that's set down
parolles i humbly thank you sir a truth's a truth the
 rogues are marvellous poor
first soldier reads demand of him of what strength they are
 afoot what say you to that

 their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces
bertram what shall be done to him
first lord nothing but let him have thanks demand of him my
 condition and what credit i have with the duke
first soldier well that's set down
 reads
 you shall demand of him whether one captain dumain
 be i the camp a frenchman what his reputation is
 with the duke what his valour honesty and
 expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not
 possible with wellweighing sums of gold to
 corrupt him to revolt what say you to this what
 do you know of it
parolles i beseech you let me answer to the particular of
 the inter'gatories demand them singly
first soldier do you know this captain dumain
parolles i know him a was a botcher's prentice in paris
 from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
 fool with childa dumb innocent that could not
 say him nay
bertram nay by your leave hold your hands though i know
 his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls
first soldier well is this captain in the duke of florence's camp
parolles upon my knowledge he is and lousy
first lord nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your
 lordship anon
first soldier what is his reputation with the duke
parolles the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
 of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him
 out o the band i think i have his letter in my pocket
first soldier marry we'll search
parolles in good sadness i do not know either it is there
 or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
 in my tent
first soldier here tis here's a paper shall i read it to you
parolles i do not know if it be it or no
bertram our interpreter does it well
first lord excellently
first soldier reads dian the count's a fool and full of gold'
parolles that is not the duke's letter sir that is an
 advertisement to a proper maid in florence one
 diana to take heed of the allurement of one count
 rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very
 ruttish i pray you sir put it up again
first soldier nay i'll read it first by your favour
parolles my meaning in't i protest was very honest in the
 behalf of the maid for i knew the young count to be
 a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to
 virginity and devours up all the fry it finds
bertram damnable bothsides rogue
first soldier reads when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it
 after he scores he never pays the score
 half won is match well made match and well make it
 he ne'er pays afterdebts take it before
 and say a soldier dian told thee this
 men are to mell with boys are not to kiss
 for count of this the count's a fool i know it
 who pays before but not when he does owe it
 thine as he vowed to thee in thine ear
 parolles'
bertram he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
 in's forehead
second lord this is your devoted friend sir the manifold
 linguist and the armipotent soldier
bertram i could endure any thing before but a cat and now
 he's a cat to me
first soldier i perceive sir by the general's looks we shall be
 fain to hang you
parolles my life sir in any case not that i am afraid to
 die but that my offences being many i would
 repent out the remainder of nature let me live
 sir in a dungeon i the stocks or any where so i may live
first soldier we'll see what may be done so you confess freely
 therefore once more to this captain dumain you
 have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
 his valour what is his honesty
parolles he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for
 rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he
 professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he
 is stronger than hercules he will lie sir with
 such volubility that you would think truth were a
 fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will
 be swinedrunk and in his sleep he does little
 harm save to his bedclothes about him but they
 know his conditions and lay him in straw i have but
 little more to say sir of his honesty he has
 every thing that an honest man should not have what
 an honest man should have he has nothing
first lord i begin to love him for this
bertram for this description of thine honesty a pox upon
 him for me he's more and more a cat
first soldier what say you to his expertness in war
parolles faith sir he has led the drum before the english
 tragedians to belie him i will not and more of
 his soldiership i know not except in that country
 he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
 called mileend to instruct for the doubling of
 files i would do the man what honour i can but of
 this i am not certain
first lord he hath outvillained villany so far that the
 rarity redeems him
bertram a pox on him he's a cat still
first soldier his qualities being at this poor price i need not
 to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
parolles sir for a quart d'ecu he will sell the feesimple
 of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the
 entail from all remainders and a perpetual
 succession for it perpetually
first soldier what's his brother the other captain dumain
second lord why does be ask him of me
first soldier what's he
parolles e'en a crow o the same nest not altogether so
 great as the first in goodness but greater a great
 deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward
 yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is
 in a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming
 on he has the cramp
first soldier if your life be saved will you undertake to betray
 the florentine
parolles ay and the captain of his horse count rousillon
first soldier i'll whisper with the general and know his pleasure
parolles aside i'll no more drumming a plague of all
 drums only to seem to deserve well and to
 beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
 the count have i run into this danger yet who
 would have suspected an ambush where i was taken
first soldier there is no remedy sir but you must die the
 general says you that have so traitorously
 discovered the secrets of your army and made such
 pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can
 serve the world for no honest use therefore you
 must die come headsman off with his head
parolles o lord sir let me live or let me see my death
first lord that shall you and take your leave of all your friends
 unblinding him
 so look about you know you any here
bertram good morrow noble captain
second lord god bless you captain parolles
first lord god save you noble captain

 but fare you well
 exeunt bertram and lords
first soldier you are undone captain all but your scarf that
 has a knot on't yet

first soldier if you could find out a country where but women were
 that had received so much shame you might begin an
 impudent nation fare ye well sir i am for france

 twould burst at this captain i'll be no more

scene iii rousillon the count's palace
 flourish enter king countess lafeu the two
 french lords with attendants
king we lost a jewel of her and our esteem
 was made much poorer by it but your son
 as mad in folly lack'd the sense to know
 her estimation home
countess tis past my liege
 and i beseech your majesty to make it
 natural rebellion done i the blaze of youth
 when oil and fire too strong for reason's force
 o'erbears it and burns on
king my honour'd lady
 i have forgiven and forgotten all
 though my revenges were high bent upon him
 and watch'd the time to shoot
lafeu this i must say
 but first i beg my pardon the young lord
 did to his majesty his mother and his lady
 offence of mighty note but to himself
 the greatest wrong of all he lost a wife
 whose beauty did astonish the survey
 of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
 whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
 humbly call'd mistress
king praising what is lost
 makes the remembrance dear well call him hither
 we are reconciled and the first view shall kill
 all repetition let him not ask our pardon
 the nature of his great offence is dead
 and deeper than oblivion we do bury
 the incensing relics of it let him approach
 a stranger no offender and inform him
 so tis our will he should
gentleman i shall my liege
 exit
king what says he to your daughter have you spoke
lafeu all that he is hath reference to your highness
king then shall we have a match i have letters sent me
 that set him high in fame
 enter bertram
lafeu he looks well on't
king i am not a day of season
 for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
 in me at once but to the brightest beams
 distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth
 the time is fair again
bertram my highrepented blames
 dear sovereign pardon to me
king all is whole
 not one word more of the consumed time
 let's take the instant by the forward top
 for we are old and on our quick'st decrees
 the inaudible and noiseless foot of time
 steals ere we can effect them you remember
 the daughter of this lord
bertram admiringly my liege at first
 i stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
 durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
 where the impression of mine eye infixing
 contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
 which warp'd the line of every other favour
 scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stolen
 extended or contracted all proportions
 to a most hideous object thence it came
 that she whom all men praised and whom myself
 since i have lost have loved was in mine eye
 the dust that did offend it
king well excused
 that thou didst love her strikes some scores away
 from the great compt but love that comes too late
 like a remorseful pardon slowly carried
 to the great sender turns a sour offence
 crying that's good that's gone our rash faults
 make trivial price of serious things we have
 not knowing them until we know their grave
 oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
 destroy our friends and after weep their dust
 our own love waking cries to see what's done
 while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon
 be this sweet helen's knell and now forget her
 send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin
 the main consents are had and here we'll stay
 to see our widower's second marriageday
countess which better than the first o dear heaven bless
 or ere they meet in me o nature cesse
lafeu come on my son in whom my house's name
 must be digested give a favour from you
 to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
 that she may quickly come
 bertram gives a ring
 by my old beard
 and every hair that's on't helen that's dead
 was a sweet creature such a ring as this
 the last that e'er i took her at court
 i saw upon her finger
bertram hers it was not
king now pray you let me see it for mine eye
 while i was speaking oft was fasten'd to't
 this ring was mine and when i gave it helen
 i bade her if her fortunes ever stood
 necessitied to help that by this token
 i would relieve her had you that craft to reave
 her
 of what should stead her most
bertram my gracious sovereign
 howe'er it pleases you to take it so
 the ring was never hers
countess son on my life
 i have seen her wear it and she reckon'd it
 at her life's rate
lafeu i am sure i saw her wear it
bertram you are deceived my lord she never saw it
 in florence was it from a casement thrown me
 wrapp'd in a paper which contain'd the name
 of her that threw it noble she was and thought
 i stood engaged but when i had subscribed
 to mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
 i could not answer in that course of honour
 as she had made the overture she ceased
 in heavy satisfaction and would never
 receive the ring again
king plutus himself
 that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine
 hath not in nature's mystery more science
 than i have in this ring twas mine twas helen's
 whoever gave it you then if you know
 that you are well acquainted with yourself
 confess twas hers and by what rough enforcement
 you got it from her she call'd the saints to surety
 that she would never put it from her finger
 unless she gave it to yourself in bed
 where you have never come or sent it us
 upon her great disaster
bertram she never saw it
king thou speak'st it falsely as i love mine honour
 and makest conjectural fears to come into me
 which i would fain shut out if it should prove
 that thou art so inhuman'twill not prove so
 and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly
 and she is dead which nothing but to close
 her eyes myself could win me to believe
 more than to see this ring take him away
 guards seize bertram
 my forepast proofs howe'er the matter fall
 shall tax my fears of little vanity
 having vainly fear'd too little away with him
 we'll sift this matter further
bertram if you shall prove
 this ring was ever hers you shall as easy
 prove that i husbanded her bed in florence
 where yet she never was
 exit guarded
king i am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings
 enter a gentleman
gentleman gracious sovereign
 whether i have been to blame or no i know not
 here's a petition from a florentine
 who hath for four or five removes come short
 to tender it herself i undertook it
 vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
 of the poor suppliant who by this i know
 is here attending her business looks in her
 with an importing visage and she told me
 in a sweet verbal brief it did concern
 your highness with herself
king reads upon his many protestations to marry me
 when his wife was dead i blush to say it he won
 me now is the count rousillon a widower his vows
 are forfeited to me and my honour's paid to him he
 stole from florence taking no leave and i follow
 him to his country for justice grant it me o
 king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer
 flourishes and a poor maid is undone
 diana capilet
lafeu i will buy me a soninlaw in a fair and toll for
 this i'll none of him
king the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu
 to bring forth this discovery seek these suitors
 go speedily and bring again the count
 i am afeard the life of helen lady
 was foully snatch'd
countess now justice on the doers
 reenter bertram guarded
king i wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you
 and that you fly them as you swear them lordship
 yet you desire to marry
 enter widow and diana
 what woman's that
diana i am my lord a wretched florentine
 derived from the ancient capilet
 my suit as i do understand you know
 and therefore know how far i may be pitied
widow i am her mother sir whose age and honour
 both suffer under this complaint we bring
 and both shall cease without your remedy
king come hither count do you know these women
bertram my lord i neither can nor will deny
 but that i know them do they charge me further
diana why do you look so strange upon your wife
bertram she's none of mine my lord
diana if you shall marry
 you give away this hand and that is mine
 you give away heaven's vows and those are mine
 you give away myself which is known mine
 for i by vow am so embodied yours
 that she which marries you must marry me
 either both or none
lafeu your reputation comes too short for my daughter you
 are no husband for her
bertram my lord this is a fond and desperate creature
 whom sometime i have laugh'd with let your highness
 lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
 than for to think that i would sink it here
king sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
 till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour
 than in my thought it lies
diana good my lord
 ask him upon his oath if he does think
 he had not my virginity
king what say'st thou to her
bertram she's impudent my lord
 and was a common gamester to the camp
diana he does me wrong my lord if i were so
 he might have bought me at a common price
 do not believe him o behold this ring
 whose high respect and rich validity
 did lack a parallel yet for all that
 he gave it to a commoner o the camp
 if i be one
countess he blushes and tis it
 of six preceding ancestors that gem
 conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue
 hath it been owed and worn this is his wife
 that ring's a thousand proofs
king methought you said
 you saw one here in court could witness it
diana i did my lord but loath am to produce
 so bad an instrument his name's parolles
lafeu i saw the man today if man he be
king find him and bring him hither
 exit an attendant
bertram what of him
 he's quoted for a most perfidious slave
 with all the spots o the world tax'd and debosh'd
 whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
 am i or that or this for what he'll utter
 that will speak any thing
king she hath that ring of yours
bertram i think she has certain it is i liked her
 and boarded her i the wanton way of youth
 she knew her distance and did angle for me
 madding my eagerness with her restraint
 as all impediments in fancy's course
 are motives of more fancy and in fine
 her infinite cunning with her modern grace
 subdued me to her rate she got the ring
 and i had that which any inferior might
 at marketprice have bought
diana i must be patient
 you that have turn'd off a first so noble wife
 may justly diet me i pray you yet
 since you lack virtue i will lose a husband
 send for your ring i will return it home
 and give me mine again
bertram i have it not
king what ring was yours i pray you
diana sir much like
 the same upon your finger
king know you this ring this ring was his of late
diana and this was it i gave him being abed
king the story then goes false you threw it him
 out of a casement
diana i have spoke the truth
 enter parolles
bertram my lord i do confess the ring was hers
king you boggle shrewdly every feather stars you
 is this the man you speak of
diana ay my lord
king tell me sirrah but tell me true i charge you

 which on your just proceeding i'll keep off
 by him and by this woman here what know you

 honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him

king come come to the purpose did he love this woman
parolles faith sir he did love her but how

king how is that
parolles he loved her sir and loved her not
king as thou art a knave and no knave what an
 equivocal companion is this
parolles i am a poor man and at your majesty's command
lafeu he's a good drum my lord but a naughty orator
diana do you know he promised me marriage
parolles faith i know more than i'll speak
king but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest
parolles yes so please your majesty i did go between them
 as i said but more than that he loved her for
 indeed he was mad for her and talked of satan and
 of limbo and of furies and i know not what yet i
 was in that credit with them at that time that i
 knew of their going to bed and of other motions
 as promising her marriage and things which would
 derive me ill will to speak of therefore i will not
 speak what i know
king thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say
 they are married but thou art too fine in thy
 evidence therefore stand aside
 this ring you say was yours
diana ay my good lord
king where did you buy it or who gave it you
diana it was not given me nor i did not buy it
king who lent it you
diana it was not lent me neither
king where did you find it then
diana i found it not
king if it were yours by none of all these ways
 how could you give it him
diana i never gave it him
lafeu this woman's an easy glove my lord she goes off
 and on at pleasure
king this ring was mine i gave it his first wife
diana it might be yours or hers for aught i know
king take her away i do not like her now

 great king i am no strumpet by my life
 i am either maid or else this old man's wife
king she does abuse our ears to prison with her
diana good mother fetch my bail stay royal sir
 exit widow
 the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
 and he shall surety me but for this lord
 who hath abused me as he knows himself
 though yet he never harm'd me here i quit him
 he knows himself my bed he hath defiled
 and at that time he got his wife with child
 dead though she be she feels her young one kick

 to make the even truth in pleasure flow
 to diana
 if thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower
 choose thou thy husband and i'll pay thy dower
 for i can guess that by thy honest aid
 thou keep'st a wife herself thyself a maid
 of that and all the progress more or less
 resolvedly more leisure shall express

 the bitter past more welcome is the sweet
 flourish

orlando as i remember adam it was upon this fashion
 bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
 and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
 blessing to breed me well and there begins my
 sadness my brother jaques he keeps at school and
 report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
 he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
 properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
 that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
 differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses
 are bred better for besides that they are fair
 with their feeding they are taught their manage
 and to that end riders dearly hired but i his
 brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
 which his animals on his dunghills are as much
 bound to him as i besides this nothing that he so
 plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
 me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
 me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
 brother and as much as in him lies mines my
 gentility with my education this is it adam that
 grieves me and the spirit of my father which i
 think is within me begins to mutiny against this
 servitude i will no longer endure it though yet i
 know no wise remedy how to avoid it

 shake me up

 you are my eldest brother and in the gentle
 condition of blood you should so know me the
 courtesy of nations allows you my better in that

 nearer to his reverence
oliver what boy
orlando come come elder brother you are too young in this
oliver wilt thou lay hands on me villain
orlando i am no villain i am the youngest son of sir
 rowland de boys he was my father and he is thrice
 a villain that says such a father begot villains
 wert thou not my brother i would not take this hand
 from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
 tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself
adam sweet masters be patient for your father's
 remembrance be at accord
oliver let me go i say
orlando i will not till i please you shall hear me my
 father charged you in his will to give me good
 education you have trained me like a peasant
 obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
 qualities the spirit of my father grows strong in
 me and i will no longer endure it therefore allow
 me such exercises as may become a gentleman or
 give me the poor allottery my father left me by
 testament with that i will go buy my fortunes
oliver and what wilt thou do beg when that is spent
 well sir get you in i will not long be troubled
 with you you shall have some part of your will i
 pray you leave me
orlando i will no further offend you than becomes me for my good
oliver get you with him you old dog
adam is old dog my reward most true i have lost my
 teeth in your service god be with my old master

 physic your rankness and yet give no thousand
 crowns neither holla dennis
 enter dennis
dennis calls your worship
oliver was not charles the duke's wrestler here to speak with me
dennis so please you he is here at the door and importunes
 access to you
oliver call him in
 exit dennis
 twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is
 enter charles
charles good morrow to your worship
oliver good monsieur charles what's the new news at the
 new court
charles there's no news at the court sir but the old news
 that is the old duke is banished by his younger
 brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
 have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
 whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
 therefore he gives them good leave to wander
oliver can you tell if rosalind the duke's daughter be
 banished with her father
charles o no for the duke's daughter her cousin so loves
 her being ever from their cradles bred together
 that she would have followed her exile or have died
 to stay behind her she is at the court and no
 less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
 never two ladies loved as they do
oliver where will the old duke live
charles they say he is already in the forest of arden and
 a many merry men with him and there they live like
 the old robin hood of england they say many young
 gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
 carelessly as they did in the golden world
oliver what you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke
charles marry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a
 matter i am given sir secretly to understand
 that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition
 to come in disguised against me to try a fall
 tomorrow sir i wrestle for my credit and he that
 escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
 well your brother is but young and tender and
 for your love i would be loath to foil him as i
 must for my own honour if he come in therefore
 out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint you
 withal that either you might stay him from his
 intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
 run into in that it is a thing of his own search
 and altogether against my will
oliver charles i thank thee for thy love to me which
 thou shalt find i will most kindly requite i had
 myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
 have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
 it but he is resolute i'll tell thee charles
 it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full
 of ambition an envious emulator of every man's
 good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
 me his natural brother therefore use thy
 discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck
 as his finger and thou wert best look to't for if
 thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
 mightily grace himself on thee he will practise
 against thee by poison entrap thee by some
 treacherous device and never leave thee till he
 hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other
 for i assure thee and almost with tears i speak
 it there is not one so young and so villanous this
 day living i speak but brotherly of him but
 should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must
 blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
charles i am heartily glad i came hither to you if he come
 tomorrow i'll give him his payment if ever he go
 alone again i'll never wrestle for prize more and
 so god keep your worship
oliver farewell good charles
 exit charles
 now will i stir this gamester i hope i shall see
 an end of him for my soul yet i know not why
 hates nothing more than he yet he's gentle never
 schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
 all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
 in the heart of the world and especially of my own
 people who best know him that i am altogether
 misprised but it shall not be so long this
 wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that
 i kindle the boy thither which now i'll go about
 exit
 as you like it
act i
scene ii lawn before the duke's palace
 enter celia and rosalind
celia i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry
rosalind dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of
 and would you yet i were merrier unless you could
 teach me to forget a banished father you must not
 learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure
celia herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight
 that i love thee if my uncle thy banished father
 had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
 hadst been still with me i could have taught my
 love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
 if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
 tempered as mine is to thee
rosalind well i will forget the condition of my estate to
 rejoice in yours
celia you know my father hath no child but i nor none is
 like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
 be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
 father perforce i will render thee again in
 affection by mine honour i will and when i break
 that oath let me turn monster therefore my
 sweet rose my dear rose be merry
rosalind from henceforth i will coz and devise sports let
 me see what think you of falling in love
celia marry i prithee do to make sport withal but
 love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
 neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
 in honour come off again
rosalind what shall be our sport then
celia let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from
 her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
rosalind i would we could do so for her benefits are
 mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
 doth most mistake in her gifts to women
celia tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
 makes honest and those that she makes honest she
 makes very illfavouredly
rosalind nay now thou goest from fortune's office to
 nature's fortune reigns in gifts of the world
 not in the lineaments of nature
 enter touchstone
celia no when nature hath made a fair creature may she
 not by fortune fall into the fire though nature
 hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not
 fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument
rosalind indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when
 fortune makes nature's natural the cutteroff of
 nature's wit
celia peradventure this is not fortune's work neither but
 nature's who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
 to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
 natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
 the fool is the whetstone of the wits how now
 wit whither wander you
touchstone mistress you must come away to your father
celia were you made the messenger
touchstone no by mine honour but i was bid to come for you
rosalind where learned you that oath fool
touchstone of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
 were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
 mustard was naught now i'll stand to it the
 pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
 yet was not the knight forsworn
celia how prove you that in the great heap of your
 knowledge
rosalind ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
touchstone stand you both forth now stroke your chins and
 swear by your beards that i am a knave
celia by our beards if we had them thou art
touchstone by my knavery if i had it then i were but if you
 swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
 more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
 never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
 before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard
celia prithee who is't that thou meanest
touchstone one that old frederick your father loves
celia my father's love is enough to honour him enough
 speak no more of him you'll be whipped for taxation
 one of these days
touchstone the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
 wise men do foolishly
celia by my troth thou sayest true for since the little
 wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
 that wise men have makes a great show here comes
 monsieur le beau
rosalind with his mouth full of news
celia which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
rosalind then shall we be newscrammed
celia all the better we shall be the more marketable
 enter le beau
 bon jour monsieur le beau what's the news
le beau fair princess you have lost much good sport
celia sport of what colour
le beau what colour madam how shall i answer you
rosalind as wit and fortune will
touchstone or as the destinies decree
celia well said that was laid on with a trowel
touchstone nay if i keep not my rank
rosalind thou losest thy old smell
le beau you amaze me ladies i would have told you of good
 wrestling which you have lost the sight of
rosalind you tell us the manner of the wrestling
le beau i will tell you the beginning and if it please
 your ladyships you may see the end for the best is
 yet to do and here where you are they are coming
 to perform it
celia well the beginning that is dead and buried
le beau there comes an old man and his three sons
celia i could match this beginning with an old tale
le beau three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
rosalind with bills on their necks be it known unto all men
 by these presents'
le beau the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the
 duke's wrestler which charles in a moment threw him
 and broke three of his ribs that there is little
 hope of life in him so he served the second and
 so the third yonder they lie the poor old man
 their father making such pitiful dole over them
 that all the beholders take his part with weeping
rosalind alas
touchstone but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies
 have lost
le beau why this that i speak of
touchstone thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first
 time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport
 for ladies
celia or i i promise thee
rosalind but is there any else longs to see this broken music
 in his sides is there yet another dotes upon
 ribbreaking shall we see this wrestling cousin
le beau you must if you stay here for here is the place
 appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to
 perform it
celia yonder sure they are coming let us now stay and see it
 flourish enter duke frederick lords orlando
 charles and attendants
duke frederick come on since the youth will not be entreated his
 own peril on his forwardness
rosalind is yonder the man
le beau even he madam
celia alas he is too young yet he looks successfully
duke frederick how now daughter and cousin are you crept hither
 to see the wrestling
rosalind ay my liege so please you give us leave
duke frederick you will take little delight in it i can tell you
 there is such odds in the man in pity of the
 challenger's youth i would fain dissuade him but he
 will not be entreated speak to him ladies see if
 you can move him
celia call him hither good monsieur le beau
duke frederick do so i'll not be by
le beau monsieur the challenger the princesses call for you
orlando i attend them with all respect and duty
rosalind young man have you challenged charles the wrestler
orlando no fair princess he is the general challenger i
 come but in as others do to try with him the
 strength of my youth
celia young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your
 years you have seen cruel proof of this man's
 strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or
 knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your
 adventure would counsel you to a more equal
 enterprise we pray you for your own sake to
 embrace your own safety and give over this attempt
rosalind do young sir your reputation shall not therefore
 be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke
 that the wrestling might not go forward
orlando i beseech you punish me not with your hard
 thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny
 so fair and excellent ladies any thing but let
 your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
 trial wherein if i be foiled there is but one
 shamed that was never gracious if killed but one
 dead that was willing to be so i shall do my
 friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the
 world no injury for in it i have nothing only in
 the world i fill up a place which may be better
 supplied when i have made it empty
rosalind the little strength that i have i would it were with you
celia and mine to eke out hers
rosalind fare you well pray heaven i be deceived in you
celia your heart's desires be with you
charles come where is this young gallant that is so
 desirous to lie with his mother earth
orlando ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
duke frederick you shall try but one fall
charles no i warrant your grace you shall not entreat him
 to a second that have so mightily persuaded him
 from a first
orlando an you mean to mock me after you should not have
 mocked me before but come your ways
rosalind now hercules be thy speed young man
celia i would i were invisible to catch the strong
 fellow by the leg
 they wrestle
rosalind o excellent young man
celia if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye i can tell who
 should down
 shout charles is thrown
duke frederick no more no more
orlando yes i beseech your grace i am not yet well breathed
duke frederick how dost thou charles
le beau he cannot speak my lord
duke frederick bear him away what is thy name young man
orlando orlando my liege the youngest son of sir rowland de boys
duke frederick i would thou hadst been son to some man else
 the world esteem'd thy father honourable
 but i did find him still mine enemy
 thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed
 hadst thou descended from another house
 but fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
 i would thou hadst told me of another father
 exeunt duke frederick train and le beau
celia were i my father coz would i do this
orlando i am more proud to be sir rowland's son
 his youngest son and would not change that calling
 to be adopted heir to frederick
rosalind my father loved sir rowland as his soul
 and all the world was of my father's mind
 had i before known this young man his son
 i should have given him tears unto entreaties
 ere he should thus have ventured
celia gentle cousin
 let us go thank him and encourage him
 my father's rough and envious disposition
 sticks me at heart sir you have well deserved
 if you do keep your promises in love
 but justly as you have exceeded all promise
 your mistress shall be happy
rosalind gentleman
 giving him a chain from her neck
 wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
 that could give more but that her hand lacks means
 shall we go coz
celia ay fare you well fair gentleman
orlando can i not say i thank you my better parts
 are all thrown down and that which here stands up
 is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
rosalind he calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes
 i'll ask him what he would did you call sir
 sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
 more than your enemies
celia will you go coz
rosalind have with you fare you well
 exeunt rosalind and celia
orlando what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
 i cannot speak to her yet she urged conference
 o poor orlando thou art overthrown
 or charles or something weaker masters thee
 reenter le beau
le beau good sir i do in friendship counsel you
 to leave this place albeit you have deserved
 high commendation true applause and love
 yet such is now the duke's condition
 that he misconstrues all that you have done
 the duke is humorous what he is indeed
 more suits you to conceive than i to speak of
orlando i thank you sir and pray you tell me this
 which of the two was daughter of the duke
 that here was at the wrestling
le beau neither his daughter if we judge by manners
 but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
 the other is daughter to the banish'd duke
 and here detain'd by her usurping uncle
 to keep his daughter company whose loves
 are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
 but i can tell you that of late this duke
 hath ta'en displeasure gainst his gentle niece
 grounded upon no other argument
 but that the people praise her for her virtues
 and pity her for her good father's sake
 and on my life his malice gainst the lady
 will suddenly break forth sir fare you well
 hereafter in a better world than this
 i shall desire more love and knowledge of you
orlando i rest much bounden to you fare you well
 exit le beau
 thus must i from the smoke into the smother
 from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
 but heavenly rosalind
 exit
 as you like it
act i
scene iii a room in the palace
 enter celia and rosalind
celia why cousin why rosalind cupid have mercy not a word
rosalind not one to throw at a dog
celia no thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
 curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons
rosalind then there were two cousins laid up when the one
 should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
 without any
celia but is all this for your father
rosalind no some of it is for my child's father o how
 full of briers is this workingday world
celia they are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in
 holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden
 paths our very petticoats will catch them
rosalind i could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart
celia hem them away
rosalind i would try if i could cry hem and have him
celia come come wrestle with thy affections
rosalind o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
celia o a good wish upon you you will try in time in
 despite of a fall but turning these jests out of
 service let us talk in good earnest is it
 possible on such a sudden you should fall into so
 strong a liking with old sir rowland's youngest son
rosalind the duke my father loved his father dearly
celia doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
 dearly by this kind of chase i should hate him
 for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate
 not orlando
rosalind no faith hate him not for my sake
celia why should i not doth he not deserve well
rosalind let me love him for that and do you love him
 because i do look here comes the duke
celia with his eyes full of anger
 enter duke frederick with lords
duke frederick mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
 and get you from our court
rosalind me uncle
duke frederick you cousin
 within these ten days if that thou be'st found
 so near our public court as twenty miles
 thou diest for it
rosalind i do beseech your grace
 let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
 if with myself i hold intelligence
 or have acquaintance with mine own desires
 if that i do not dream or be not frantic
 as i do trust i am notthen dear uncle
 never so much as in a thought unborn
 did i offend your highness
duke frederick thus do all traitors
 if their purgation did consist in words
 they are as innocent as grace itself
 let it suffice thee that i trust thee not
rosalind yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
 tell me whereon the likelihood depends
duke frederick thou art thy father's daughter there's enough
rosalind so was i when your highness took his dukedom
 so was i when your highness banish'd him
 treason is not inherited my lord
 or if we did derive it from our friends
 what's that to me my father was no traitor
 then good my liege mistake me not so much
 to think my poverty is treacherous
celia dear sovereign hear me speak
duke frederick ay celia we stay'd her for your sake
 else had she with her father ranged along
celia i did not then entreat to have her stay
 it was your pleasure and your own remorse
 i was too young that time to value her
 but now i know her if she be a traitor
 why so am i we still have slept together
 rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together
 and wheresoever we went like juno's swans
 still we went coupled and inseparable
duke frederick she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
 her very silence and her patience
 speak to the people and they pity her
 thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
 and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
 when she is gone then open not thy lips
 firm and irrevocable is my doom
 which i have pass'd upon her she is banish'd
celia pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
 i cannot live out of her company
duke frederick you are a fool you niece provide yourself
 if you outstay the time upon mine honour
 and in the greatness of my word you die
 exeunt duke frederick and lords
celia o my poor rosalind whither wilt thou go
 wilt thou change fathers i will give thee mine
 i charge thee be not thou more grieved than i am
rosalind i have more cause
celia thou hast not cousin
 prithee be cheerful know'st thou not the duke
 hath banish'd me his daughter
rosalind that he hath not
celia no hath not rosalind lacks then the love
 which teacheth thee that thou and i am one
 shall we be sunder'd shall we part sweet girl
 no let my father seek another heir
 therefore devise with me how we may fly
 whither to go and what to bear with us
 and do not seek to take your change upon you
 to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
 for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
 say what thou canst i'll go along with thee
rosalind why whither shall we go
celia to seek my uncle in the forest of arden
rosalind alas what danger will it be to us
 maids as we are to travel forth so far
 beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
celia i'll put myself in poor and mean attire
 and with a kind of umber smirch my face
 the like do you so shall we pass along
 and never stir assailants
rosalind were it not better
 because that i am more than common tall
 that i did suit me all points like a man
 a gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh
 a boarspear in my hand andin my heart
 lie there what hidden woman's fear there will
 we'll have a swashing and a martial outside
 as many other mannish cowards have
 that do outface it with their semblances
celia what shall i call thee when thou art a man
rosalind i'll have no worse a name than jove's own page
 and therefore look you call me ganymede
 but what will you be call'd
celia something that hath a reference to my state
 no longer celia but aliena
rosalind but cousin what if we assay'd to steal
 the clownish fool out of your father's court
 would he not be a comfort to our travel
celia he'll go along o'er the wide world with me
 leave me alone to woo him let's away
 and get our jewels and our wealth together
 devise the fittest time and safest way
 to hide us from pursuit that will be made
 after my flight now go we in content
 to liberty and not to banishment
 exeunt
 as you like it
act ii
scene i the forest of arden
 enter duke senior amiens and two or three lords
 like foresters
duke senior now my comates and brothers in exile
 hath not old custom made this life more sweet
 than that of painted pomp are not these woods
 more free from peril than the envious court
 here feel we but the penalty of adam
 the seasons difference as the icy fang
 and churlish chiding of the winter's wind
 which when it bites and blows upon my body
 even till i shrink with cold i smile and say
 this is no flattery these are counsellors
 that feelingly persuade me what i am'
 sweet are the uses of adversity
 which like the toad ugly and venomous
 wears yet a precious jewel in his head
 and this our life exempt from public haunt
 finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
 sermons in stones and good in every thing
 i would not change it
amiens happy is your grace
 that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
 into so quiet and so sweet a style
duke senior come shall we go and kill us venison
 and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
 being native burghers of this desert city
 should in their own confines with forked heads
 have their round haunches gored
first lord indeed my lord
 the melancholy jaques grieves at that
 and in that kind swears you do more usurp
 than doth your brother that hath banish'd you
 today my lord of amiens and myself
 did steal behind him as he lay along
 under an oak whose antique root peeps out
 upon the brook that brawls along this wood
 to the which place a poor sequester'd stag
 that from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt
 did come to languish and indeed my lord
 the wretched animal heaved forth such groans
 that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
 almost to bursting and the big round tears
 coursed one another down his innocent nose
 in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
 much marked of the melancholy jaques
 stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
 augmenting it with tears
duke senior but what said jaques
 did he not moralize this spectacle
first lord o yes into a thousand similes
 first for his weeping into the needless stream
 poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament
 as worldlings do giving thy sum of more
 to that which had too much then being there alone
 left and abandon'd of his velvet friends
 'tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
 the flux of company anon a careless herd
 full of the pasture jumps along by him
 and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques
 sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
 tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
 upon that poor and broken bankrupt there'
 thus most invectively he pierceth through
 the body of the country city court
 yea and of this our life swearing that we
 are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse
 to fright the animals and to kill them up
 in their assign'd and native dwellingplace
duke senior and did you leave him in this contemplation
second lord we did my lord weeping and commenting
 upon the sobbing deer
duke senior show me the place
 i love to cope him in these sullen fits
 for then he's full of matter
first lord i'll bring you to him straight

duke frederick can it be possible that no man saw them

 are of consent and sufferance in this
first lord i cannot hear of any that did see her
 the ladies her attendants of her chamber
 saw her abed and in the morning early
 they found the bed untreasured of their mistress
second lord my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
 your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
 hisperia the princess gentlewoman
 confesses that she secretly o'erheard
 your daughter and her cousin much commend
 the parts and graces of the wrestler
 that did but lately foil the sinewy charles
 and she believes wherever they are gone
 that youth is surely in their company
duke frederick send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
 if he be absent bring his brother to me
 i'll make him find him do this suddenly
 and let not search and inquisition quail
 to bring again these foolish runaways

 enter orlando and adam meeting
orlando who's there
adam what my young master o my gentle master
 o my sweet master o you memory
 of old sir rowland why what make you here
 why are you virtuous why do people love you
 and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
 why would you be so fond to overcome
 the bonny priser of the humorous duke
 your praise is come too swiftly home before you
 know you not master to some kind of men
 their graces serve them but as enemies
 no more do yours your virtues gentle master
 are sanctified and holy traitors to you
 o what a world is this when what is comely
 envenoms him that bears it
orlando why what's the matter
adam o unhappy youth
 come not within these doors within this roof
 the enemy of all your graces lives
 your brotherno no brother yet the son
 yet not the son i will not call him son
 of him i was about to call his father
 hath heard your praises and this night he means
 to burn the lodging where you use to lie
 and you within it if he fail of that
 he will have other means to cut you off
 i overheard him and his practises
 this is no place this house is but a butchery
 abhor it fear it do not enter it
orlando why whither adam wouldst thou have me go
adam no matter whither so you come not here
orlando what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
 or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
 a thievish living on the common road
 this i must do or know not what to do
 yet this i will not do do how i can
 i rather will subject me to the malice
 of a diverted blood and bloody brother
adam but do not so i have five hundred crowns
 the thrifty hire i saved under your father
 which i did store to be my fosternurse
 when service should in my old limbs lie lame
 and unregarded age in corners thrown
 take that and he that doth the ravens feed
 yea providently caters for the sparrow
 be comfort to my age here is the gold
 and all this i give you let me be your servant
 though i look old yet i am strong and lusty
 for in my youth i never did apply
 hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
 nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
 the means of weakness and debility
 therefore my age is as a lusty winter
 frosty but kindly let me go with you
 i'll do the service of a younger man
 in all your business and necessities
orlando o good old man how well in thee appears
 the constant service of the antique world
 when service sweat for duty not for meed
 thou art not for the fashion of these times
 where none will sweat but for promotion
 and having that do choke their service up
 even with the having it is not so with thee
 but poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
 that cannot so much as a blossom yield
 in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
 but come thy ways well go along together
 and ere we have thy youthful wages spent
 we'll light upon some settled low content
adam master go on and i will follow thee
 to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
 from seventeen years till now almost fourscore
 here lived i but now live here no more
 at seventeen years many their fortunes seek
 but at fourscore it is too late a week
 yet fortune cannot recompense me better
 than to die well and not my master's debtor

rosalind o jupiter how weary are my spirits
touchstone i care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary

 apparel and to cry like a woman but i must comfort
 the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show
 itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage
 good aliena
celia i pray you bear with me i cannot go no further

 look you who comes here a young man and an old in
 solemn talk
corin that is the way to make her scorn you still
silvius o corin that thou knew'st how i do love her
corin i partly guess for i have loved ere now
silvius no corin being old thou canst not guess
 though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
 as ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow
 but if thy love were ever like to mine
 as sure i think did never man love so
 how many actions most ridiculous
 hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
corin into a thousand that i have forgotten
silvius o thou didst then ne'er love so heartily
 if thou remember'st not the slightest folly
 that ever love did make thee run into
 thou hast not loved
 or if thou hast not sat as i do now
 wearying thy hearer in thy mistress praise
 thou hast not loved
 or if thou hast not broke from company
 abruptly as my passion now makes me
 thou hast not loved
 o phebe phebe phebe
 exit
rosalind alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
 i have by hard adventure found mine own
touchstone and i mine i remember when i was in love i broke
 my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
 coming anight to jane smile and i remember the
 kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
 pretty chopt hands had milked and i remember the
 wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom i took
 two cods and giving her them again said with
 weeping tears wear these for my sake we that are
 true lovers run into strange capers but as all is
 mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly
rosalind thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of
touchstone nay i shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till i
 break my shins against it
rosalind jove jove this shepherd's passion
 is much upon my fashion
touchstone and mine but it grows something stale with me
celia i pray you one of you question yond man
 if he for gold will give us any food
 i faint almost to death
touchstone holla you clown
rosalind peace fool he's not thy kinsman
corin who calls
touchstone your betters sir

rosalind peace i say good even to you friend
corin and to you gentle sir and to you all
rosalind i prithee shepherd if that love or gold
 can in this desert place buy entertainment
 bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
 here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
 and faints for succor
corin fair sir i pity her
 and wish for her sake more than for mine own
 my fortunes were more able to relieve her
 but i am shepherd to another man
 and do not shear the fleeces that i graze
 my master is of churlish disposition
 and little recks to find the way to heaven
 by doing deeds of hospitality
 besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
 are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
 by reason of his absence there is nothing
 that you will feed on but what is come see
 and in my voice most welcome shall you be
rosalind what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
corin that young swain that you saw here but erewhile
 that little cares for buying any thing
rosalind i pray thee if it stand with honesty
 buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
 and thou shalt have to pay for it of us
celia and we will mend thy wages i like this place
 and willingly could waste my time in it
corin assuredly the thing is to be sold
 go with me if you like upon report

 nothing will you sing
amiens more at your request than to please myself

 of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily
 methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me
 the beggarly thanks come sing and you that will
 not hold your tongues
amiens well i'll end the song sirs cover the while the
 duke will drink under this tree he hath been all

scene vii the forest
 a table set out enter duke senior amiens and
 lords like outlaws
duke senior i think he be transform'd into a beast
 for i can no where find him like a man
first lord my lord he is but even now gone hence
 here was he merry hearing of a song
duke senior if he compact of jars grow musical
 we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
 go seek him tell him i would speak with him
 enter jaques
first lord he saves my labour by his own approach
duke senior why how now monsieur what a life is this
 that your poor friends must woo your company
 what you look merrily
jaques a fool a fool i met a fool i the forest
 a motley fool a miserable world
 as i do live by food i met a fool
 who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun
 and rail'd on lady fortune in good terms
 in good set terms and yet a motley fool
 good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he
 call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune'
 and then he drew a dial from his poke
 and looking on it with lacklustre eye
 says very wisely it is ten o'clock
 thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
 tis but an hour ago since it was nine
 and after one hour more twill be eleven
 and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
 and then from hour to hour we rot and rot
 and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear
 the motley fool thus moral on the time
 my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
 that fools should be so deepcontemplative
 and i did laugh sans intermission
 an hour by his dial o noble fool
 a worthy fool motley's the only wear
duke senior what fool is this
jaques o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier
 and says if ladies be but young and fair
 they have the gift to know it and in his brain
 which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
 after a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd
 with observation the which he vents
 in mangled forms o that i were a fool
 i am ambitious for a motley coat
duke senior thou shalt have one
jaques it is my only suit
 provided that you weed your better judgments
 of all opinion that grows rank in them
 that i am wise i must have liberty
 withal as large a charter as the wind
 to blow on whom i please for so fools have
 and they that are most galled with my folly
 they most must laugh and why sir must they so
 the why is plain as way to parish church
 he that a fool doth very wisely hit
 doth very foolishly although he smart
 not to seem senseless of the bob if not
 the wise man's folly is anatomized
 even by the squandering glances of the fool
 invest me in my motley give me leave
 to speak my mind and i will through and through
 cleanse the foul body of the infected world
 if they will patiently receive my medicine
duke senior fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do
jaques what for a counter would i do but good
duke senior most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
 for thou thyself hast been a libertine
 as sensual as the brutish sting itself
 and all the embossed sores and headed evils
 that thou with licence of free foot hast caught
 wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
jaques why who cries out on pride
 that can therein tax any private party
 doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
 till that the weary very means do ebb
 what woman in the city do i name
 when that i say the citywoman bears
 the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
 who can come in and say that i mean her
 when such a one as she such is her neighbour
 or what is he of basest function
 that says his bravery is not of my cost
 thinking that i mean him but therein suits
 his folly to the mettle of my speech
 there then how then what then let me see wherein
 my tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right
 then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free
 why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
 unclaim'd of any man but who comes here
 enter orlando with his sword drawn
orlando forbear and eat no more
jaques why i have eat none yet
orlando nor shalt not till necessity be served
jaques of what kind should this cock come of
duke senior art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress
 or else a rude despiser of good manners
 that in civility thou seem'st so empty
orlando you touch'd my vein at first the thorny point
 of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
 of smooth civility yet am i inland bred
 and know some nurture but forbear i say
 he dies that touches any of this fruit
 till i and my affairs are answered
jaques an you will not be answered with reason i must die
duke senior what would you have your gentleness shall force
 more than your force move us to gentleness
orlando i almost die for food and let me have it
duke senior sit down and feed and welcome to our table
orlando speak you so gently pardon me i pray you
 i thought that all things had been savage here
 and therefore put i on the countenance
 of stern commandment but whate'er you are
 that in this desert inaccessible
 under the shade of melancholy boughs
 lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
 if ever you have look'd on better days
 if ever been where bells have knoll'd to church
 if ever sat at any good man's feast
 if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
 and know what tis to pity and be pitied
 let gentleness my strong enforcement be
 in the which hope i blush and hide my sword
duke senior true is it that we have seen better days
 and have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
 and sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
 of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd
 and therefore sit you down in gentleness
 and take upon command what help we have
 that to your wanting may be minister'd
orlando then but forbear your food a little while
 whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn
 and give it food there is an old poor man
 who after me hath many a weary step
 limp'd in pure love till he be first sufficed
 oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger
 i will not touch a bit
duke senior go find him out
 and we will nothing waste till you return
orlando i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
 exit
duke senior thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
 this wide and universal theatre
 presents more woeful pageants than the scene
 wherein we play in
jaques all the world's a stage
 and all the men and women merely players
 they have their exits and their entrances
 and one man in his time plays many parts
 his acts being seven ages at first the infant
 mewling and puking in the nurse's arms
 and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
 and shining morning face creeping like snail
 unwillingly to school and then the lover
 sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
 made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier
 full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
 jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
 seeking the bubble reputation
 even in the cannon's mouth and then the justice
 in fair round belly with good capon lined
 with eyes severe and beard of formal cut
 full of wise saws and modern instances
 and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts
 into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon
 with spectacles on nose and pouch on side
 his youthful hose well saved a world too wide
 for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
 turning again toward childish treble pipes
 and whistles in his sound last scene of all
 that ends this strange eventful history
 is second childishness and mere oblivion
 sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
 reenter orlando with adam
duke senior welcome set down your venerable burthen
 and let him feed
orlando i thank you most for him
adam so had you need
 i scarce can speak to thank you for myself
duke senior welcome fall to i will not trouble you
 as yet to question you about your fortunes
 give us some music and good cousin sing
 
 song
amiens blow blow thou winter wind
 thou art not so unkind
 as man's ingratitude
 thy tooth is not so keen
 because thou art not seen
 although thy breath be rude
 heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
 most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
 then heighho the holly
 this life is most jolly
 freeze freeze thou bitter sky
 that dost not bite so nigh
 as benefits forgot
 though thou the waters warp
 thy sting is not so sharp
 as friend remember'd not
 heighho sing &c
duke senior if that you were the good sir rowland's son
 as you have whisper'd faithfully you were
 and as mine eye doth his effigies witness
 most truly limn'd and living in your face
 be truly welcome hither i am the duke
 that loved your father the residue of your fortune
 go to my cave and tell me good old man
 thou art right welcome as thy master is

 enter corin and touchstone
corin and how like you this shepherd's life master touchstone
touchstone truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
 life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life
 it is naught in respect that it is solitary i
 like it very well but in respect that it is
 private it is a very vile life now in respect it
 is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in
 respect it is not in the court it is tedious as
 is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well
 but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much
 against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherd
corin no more but that i know the more one sickens the
 worse at ease he is and that he that wants money
 means and content is without three good friends
 that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
 burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
 great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
 he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
 complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred
touchstone such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in
 court shepherd
corin no truly
touchstone then thou art damned
corin nay i hope
touchstone truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all
 on one side
corin for not being at court your reason
touchstone why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest
 good manners if thou never sawest good manners
 then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
 sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous
 state shepherd
corin not a whit touchstone those that are good manners
 at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
 behavior of the country is most mockable at the
 court you told me you salute not at the court but
 you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
 uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
touchstone instance briefly come instance
corin why we are still handling our ewes and their
 fells you know are greasy
touchstone why do not your courtier's hands sweat and is not
 the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
 a man shallow shallow a better instance i say come
corin besides our hands are hard
touchstone your lips will feel them the sooner shallow again
 a more sounder instance come
corin and they are often tarred over with the surgery of
 our sheep and would you have us kiss tar the
 courtier's hands are perfumed with civet
touchstone most shallow man thou wormsmeat in respect of a
 good piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise and
 perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the
 very uncleanly flux of a cat mend the instance shepherd
corin you have too courtly a wit for me i'll rest
touchstone wilt thou rest damned god help thee shallow man
 god make incision in thee thou art raw
corin sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get
 that i wear owe no man hate envy no man's
 happiness glad of other men's good content with my
 harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
 graze and my lambs suck
touchstone that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
 and the rams together and to offer to get your
 living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a
 bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a
 twelvemonth to a crookedpated old cuckoldly ram
 out of all reasonable match if thou beest not
 damned for this the devil himself will have no
 shepherds i cannot see else how thou shouldst
 scape
corin here comes young master ganymede my new mistress's brother
 enter rosalind with a paper reading
rosalind from the east to western ind
 no jewel is like rosalind
 her worth being mounted on the wind
 through all the world bears rosalind
 all the pictures fairest lined
 are but black to rosalind
 let no fair be kept in mind
 but the fair of rosalind
touchstone i'll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
 suppers and sleepinghours excepted it is the
 right butterwomen's rank to market
rosalind out fool
touchstone for a taste
 if a hart do lack a hind
 let him seek out rosalind
 if the cat will after kind
 so be sure will rosalind
 winter garments must be lined
 so must slender rosalind
 they that reap must sheaf and bind
 then to cart with rosalind
 sweetest nut hath sourest rind
 such a nut is rosalind
 he that sweetest rose will find
 must find love's prick and rosalind
 this is the very false gallop of verses why do you
 infect yourself with them
rosalind peace you dull fool i found them on a tree
touchstone truly the tree yields bad fruit
rosalind i'll graff it with you and then i shall graff it
 with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
 i the country for you'll be rotten ere you be half
 ripe and that's the right virtue of the medlar
touchstone you have said but whether wisely or no let the
 forest judge
 enter celia with a writing
rosalind peace here comes my sister reading stand aside
celia reads
 why should this a desert be
 for it is unpeopled no
 tongues i'll hang on every tree
 that shall civil sayings show
 some how brief the life of man
 runs his erring pilgrimage
 that the stretching of a span
 buckles in his sum of age
 some of violated vows
 twixt the souls of friend and friend
 but upon the fairest boughs
 or at every sentence end
 will i rosalinda write
 teaching all that read to know
 the quintessence of every sprite
 heaven would in little show
 therefore heaven nature charged
 that one body should be fill'd
 with all graces wideenlarged
 nature presently distill'd
 helen's cheek but not her heart
 cleopatra's majesty
 atalanta's better part
 sad lucretia's modesty
 thus rosalind of many parts
 by heavenly synod was devised
 of many faces eyes and hearts
 to have the touches dearest prized
 heaven would that she these gifts should have
 and i to live and die her slave
rosalind o most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
 have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
 cried have patience good people'
celia how now back friends shepherd go off a little
 go with him sirrah
touchstone come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
 though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
 exeunt corin and touchstone
celia didst thou hear these verses
rosalind o yes i heard them all and more too for some of
 them had in them more feet than the verses would bear
celia that's no matter the feet might bear the verses
rosalind ay but the feet were lame and could not bear
 themselves without the verse and therefore stood
 lamely in the verse
celia but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
 should be hanged and carved upon these trees
rosalind i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
 before you came for look here what i found on a
 palmtree i was never so berhymed since
 pythagoras time that i was an irish rat which i
 can hardly remember
celia trow you who hath done this
rosalind is it a man
celia and a chain that you once wore about his neck
 change you colour
rosalind i prithee who
celia o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to
 meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
 and so encounter
rosalind nay but who is it
celia is it possible
rosalind nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
 tell me who it is
celia o wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
 wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
 out of all hooping
rosalind good my complexion dost thou think though i am
 caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in
 my disposition one inch of delay more is a
 southsea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it
 quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst
 stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
 out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow
 mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
 all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
 may drink thy tidings
celia so you may put a man in your belly
rosalind is he of god's making what manner of man is his
 head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
celia nay he hath but a little beard
rosalind why god will send more if the man will be
 thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if
 thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin
celia it is young orlando that tripped up the wrestler's
 heels and your heart both in an instant
rosalind nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and
 true maid
celia i faith coz tis he
rosalind orlando
celia orlando
rosalind alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and
 hose what did he when thou sawest him what said
 he how looked he wherein went he what makes
 him here did he ask for me where remains he
 how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see
 him again answer me in one word
celia you must borrow me gargantua's mouth first tis a
 word too great for any mouth of this age's size to
 say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
 answer in a catechism
rosalind but doth he know that i am in this forest and in
 man's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the
 day he wrestled
celia it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
 propositions of a lover but take a taste of my
 finding him and relish it with good observance
 i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn
rosalind it may well be called jove's tree when it drops
 forth such fruit
celia give me audience good madam
rosalind proceed
celia there lay he stretched along like a wounded knight
rosalind though it be pity to see such a sight it well
 becomes the ground
celia cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets
 unseasonably he was furnished like a hunter
rosalind o ominous he comes to kill my heart
celia i would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
 me out of tune
rosalind do you not know i am a woman when i think i must
 speak sweet say on
celia you bring me out soft comes he not here
 enter orlando and jaques
rosalind tis he slink by and note him
jaques i thank you for your company but good faith i had
 as lief have been myself alone
orlando and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you
 too for your society
jaques god be wi you let's meet as little as we can
orlando i do desire we may be better strangers
jaques i pray you mar no more trees with writing
 lovesongs in their barks
orlando i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
 them illfavouredly
jaques rosalind is your love's name
orlando yes just
jaques i do not like her name
orlando there was no thought of pleasing you when she was
 christened
jaques what stature is she of
orlando just as high as my heart
jaques you are full of pretty answers have you not been
 acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
 out of rings
orlando not so but i answer you right painted cloth from
 whence you have studied your questions
jaques you have a nimble wit i think twas made of
 atalanta's heels will you sit down with me and
 we two will rail against our mistress the world and
 all our misery
orlando i will chide no breather in the world but myself
 against whom i know most faults
jaques the worst fault you have is to be in love
orlando tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue
 i am weary of you
jaques by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found
 you
orlando he is drowned in the brook look but in and you
 shall see him
jaques there i shall see mine own figure
orlando which i take to be either a fool or a cipher
jaques i'll tarry no longer with you farewell good
 signior love
orlando i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur
 melancholy
 exit jaques
rosalind aside to celia i will speak to him like a saucy
 lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
 do you hear forester
orlando very well what would you
rosalind i pray you what is't o'clock
orlando you should ask me what time o day there's no clock
 in the forest
rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else
 sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
 detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock
orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that
 been as proper
rosalind by no means sir time travels in divers paces with
 divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles
 withal who time trots withal who time gallops
 withal and who he stands still withal
orlando i prithee who doth he trot withal
rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
 contract of her marriage and the day it is
 solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight
 time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
 seven year
orlando who ambles time withal
rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that
 hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
 he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
 he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
 and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
 of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal
orlando who doth he gallop withal
rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as
 softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
orlando who stays it still withal
rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
 term and term and then they perceive not how time moves
orlando where dwell you pretty youth
rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the
 skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
orlando are you native of this place
rosalind as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled
orlando your accent is something finer than you could
 purchase in so removed a dwelling
rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old
 religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
 in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
 too well for there he fell in love i have heard
 him read many lectures against it and i thank god
 i am not a woman to be touched with so many
 giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
 whole sex withal
orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he
 laid to the charge of women
rosalind there were none principal they were all like one
 another as halfpence are every one fault seeming
 monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it
orlando i prithee recount some of them
rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that
 are sick there is a man haunts the forest that
 abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on
 their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
 on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
 rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would
 give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
 quotidian of love upon him
orlando i am he that is so loveshaked i pray you tell me
 your remedy
rosalind there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he
 taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
 of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner
orlando what were his marks
rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
 sunken which you have not an unquestionable
 spirit which you have not a beard neglected
 which you have not but i pardon you for that for
 simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
 revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
 bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
 untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
 careless desolation but you are no such man you
 are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
 loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other
orlando fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love
rosalind me believe it you may as soon make her that you
 love believe it which i warrant she is apter to
 do than to confess she does that is one of the
 points in the which women still give the lie to
 their consciences but in good sooth are you he
 that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind
 is so admired
orlando i swear to thee youth by the white hand of
 rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he
rosalind but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
rosalind love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves
 as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
 the reason why they are not so punished and cured
 is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
 are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel
orlando did you ever cure any so
rosalind yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me
 his love his mistress and i set him every day to
 woo me at which time would i being but a moonish
 youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
 and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
 inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
 passion something and for no passion truly any
 thing as boys and women are for the most part
 cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
 him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
 for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor
 from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
 madness which was to forswear the full stream of
 the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
 and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon
 me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
 heart that there shall not be one spot of love in't
orlando i would not be cured youth
rosalind i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind
 and come every day to my cote and woo me
orlando now by the faith of my love i will tell me
 where it is
rosalind go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way
 you shall tell me where in the forest you live
 will you go
orlando with all my heart good youth
rosalind nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go
 exeunt
 as you like it

scene iii the forest
 enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind
touchstone come apace good audrey i will fetch up your
 goats audrey and how audrey am i the man yet
 doth my simple feature content you
audrey your features lord warrant us what features
touchstone i am here with thee and thy goats as the most
 capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths
jaques aside o knowledge illinhabited worse than jove
 in a thatched house
touchstone when a man's verses cannot be understood nor a
 man's good wit seconded with the forward child
 understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
 great reckoning in a little room truly i would
 the gods had made thee poetical
audrey i do not know what poetical is is it honest in
 deed and word is it a true thing
touchstone no truly for the truest poetry is the most
 feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
 they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign
audrey do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
touchstone i do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
 honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some
 hope thou didst feign
audrey would you not have me honest
touchstone no truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for
 honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
jaques aside a material fool
audrey well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods
 make me honest
touchstone truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
 were to put good meat into an unclean dish
audrey i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul
touchstone well praised be the gods for thy foulness
 sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may
 be i will marry thee and to that end i have been
 with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next
 village who hath promised to meet me in this place
 of the forest and to couple us
jaques aside i would fain see this meeting
audrey well the gods give us joy
touchstone amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart
 stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple
 but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts but what
 though courage as horns are odious they are
 necessary it is said many a man knows no end of
 his goods right many a man has good horns and
 knows no end of them well that is the dowry of
 his wife tis none of his own getting horns
 even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer
 hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man
 therefore blessed no as a walled town is more
 worthier than a village so is the forehead of a
 married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
 bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
 skill by so much is a horn more precious than to
 want here comes sir oliver
 enter sir oliver martext
 sir oliver martext you are well met will you
 dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go
 with you to your chapel
sir oliver martext is there none here to give the woman
touchstone i will not take her on gift of any man
sir oliver martext truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
jaques advancing
 proceed proceed i'll give her
touchstone good even good master whatyecall't how do you
 sir you are very well met god ild you for your
 last company i am very glad to see you even a
 toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered
jaques will you be married motley
touchstone as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
 the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and
 as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling
jaques and will you being a man of your breeding be
 married under a bush like a beggar get you to
 church and have a good priest that can tell you
 what marriage is this fellow will but join you
 together as they join wainscot then one of you will
 prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
touchstone aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be
 married of him than of another for he is not like
 to marry me well and not being well married it
 will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife
jaques go thou with me and let me counsel thee
touchstone come sweet audrey
 we must be married or we must live in bawdry
 farewell good master oliver not
 o sweet oliver
 o brave oliver
 leave me not behind thee but
 wind away
 begone i say
 i will not to wedding with thee
 exeunt jaques touchstone and audrey
sir oliver martext tis no matter ne'er a fantastical knave of them
 all shall flout me out of my calling

scene iv the forest
 enter rosalind and celia
rosalind never talk to me i will weep
celia do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider
 that tears do not become a man
rosalind but have i not cause to weep
celia as good cause as one would desire therefore weep
rosalind his very hair is of the dissembling colour
celia something browner than judas's marry his kisses are
 judas's own children
rosalind i faith his hair is of a good colour
celia an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
rosalind and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
 of holy bread
celia he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun
 of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously
 the very ice of chastity is in them
rosalind but why did he swear he would come this morning and
 comes not
celia nay certainly there is no truth in him
rosalind do you think so
celia yes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a
 horsestealer but for his verity in love i do
 think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
 wormeaten nut
rosalind not true in love
celia yes when he is in but i think he is not in
rosalind you have heard him swear downright he was
celia was is not is besides the oath of a lover is
 no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
 both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends
 here in the forest on the duke your father
rosalind i met the duke yesterday and had much question with
 him he asked me of what parentage i was i told
 him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go
 but what talk we of fathers when there is such a
 man as orlando
celia o that's a brave man he writes brave verses
 speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks
 them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of
 his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse
 but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
 goose but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
 guides who comes here
 enter corin
corin mistress and master you have oft inquired
 after the shepherd that complain'd of love
 who you saw sitting by me on the turf
 praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
 that was his mistress
celia well and what of him
corin if you will see a pageant truly play'd
 between the pale complexion of true love
 and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
 go hence a little and i shall conduct you
 if you will mark it
rosalind o come let us remove
 the sight of lovers feedeth those in love
 bring us to this sight and you shall say
 i'll prove a busy actor in their play
 exeunt
 as you like it
act iii
scene v another part of the forest
 enter silvius and phebe
silvius sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe
 say that you love me not but say not so
 in bitterness the common executioner
 whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard
 falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
 but first begs pardon will you sterner be
 than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
 enter rosalind celia and corin behind
phebe i would not be thy executioner
 i fly thee for i would not injure thee
 thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye
 tis pretty sure and very probable
 that eyes that are the frail'st and softest things
 who shut their coward gates on atomies
 should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers
 now i do frown on thee with all my heart
 and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
 now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
 or if thou canst not o for shame for shame
 lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
 now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
 scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
 some scar of it lean but upon a rush
 the cicatrice and capable impressure
 thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
 which i have darted at thee hurt thee not
 nor i am sure there is no force in eyes
 that can do hurt
silvius o dear phebe
 if everas that ever may be near
 you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
 then shall you know the wounds invisible
 that love's keen arrows make
phebe but till that time
 come not thou near me and when that time comes
 afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
 as till that time i shall not pity thee
rosalind and why i pray you who might be your mother
 that you insult exult and all at once
 over the wretched what though you have no beauty
 as by my faith i see no more in you
 than without candle may go dark to bed
 must you be therefore proud and pitiless
 why what means this why do you look on me
 i see no more in you than in the ordinary
 of nature's salework od's my little life
 i think she means to tangle my eyes too
 no faith proud mistress hope not after it
 tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
 your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
 that can entame my spirits to your worship
 you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
 like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
 you are a thousand times a properer man
 than she a woman tis such fools as you
 that makes the world full of illfavour'd children
 tis not her glass but you that flatters her
 and out of you she sees herself more proper
 than any of her lineaments can show her
 but mistress know yourself down on your knees
 and thank heaven fasting for a good man's love
 for i must tell you friendly in your ear
 sell when you can you are not for all markets
 cry the man mercy love him take his offer
 foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
 so take her to thee shepherd fare you well
phebe sweet youth i pray you chide a year together
 i had rather hear you chide than this man woo
rosalind he's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
 fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as
 she answers thee with frowning looks i'll sauce her
 with bitter words why look you so upon me
phebe for no ill will i bear you
rosalind i pray you do not fall in love with me
 for i am falser than vows made in wine
 besides i like you not if you will know my house
 tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
 will you go sister shepherd ply her hard
 come sister shepherdess look on him better
 and be not proud though all the world could see
 none could be so abused in sight as he
 come to our flock
 exeunt rosalind celia and corin
phebe dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might
 who ever loved that loved not at first sight'
silvius sweet phebe
phebe ha what say'st thou silvius
silvius sweet phebe pity me
phebe why i am sorry for thee gentle silvius
silvius wherever sorrow is relief would be
 if you do sorrow at my grief in love
 by giving love your sorrow and my grief
 were both extermined
phebe thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
silvius i would have you
phebe why that were covetousness
 silvius the time was that i hated thee
 and yet it is not that i bear thee love
 but since that thou canst talk of love so well
 thy company which erst was irksome to me
 i will endure and i'll employ thee too
 but do not look for further recompense
 than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd
silvius so holy and so perfect is my love
 and i in such a poverty of grace
 that i shall think it a most plenteous crop
 to glean the broken ears after the man
 that the main harvest reaps loose now and then
 a scatter'd smile and that i'll live upon
phebe know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile
silvius not very well but i have met him oft
 and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
 that the old carlot once was master of
phebe think not i love him though i ask for him
 tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
 but what care i for words yet words do well
 when he that speaks them pleases those that hear
 it is a pretty youth not very pretty
 but sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him
 he'll make a proper man the best thing in him
 is his complexion and faster than his tongue
 did make offence his eye did heal it up
 he is not very tall yet for his years he's tall
 his leg is but so so and yet tis well
 there was a pretty redness in his lip
 a little riper and more lusty red
 than that mix'd in his cheek twas just the difference
 between the constant red and mingled damask
 there be some women silvius had they mark'd him
 in parcels as i did would have gone near
 to fall in love with him but for my part
 i love him not nor hate him not and yet
 i have more cause to hate him than to love him
 for what had he to do to chide at me
 he said mine eyes were black and my hair black
 and now i am remember'd scorn'd at me
 i marvel why i answer'd not again
 but that's all one omittance is no quittance
 i'll write to him a very taunting letter
 and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius
silvius phebe with all my heart
phebe i'll write it straight
 the matter's in my head and in my heart
 i will be bitter with him and passing short
 go with me silvius
 exeunt

act iv
scene i the forest
 enter rosalind celia and jaques
jaques i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
 with thee
rosalind they say you are a melancholy fellow
jaques i am so i do love it better than laughing
rosalind those that are in extremity of either are abominable
 fellows and betray themselves to every modern
 censure worse than drunkards
jaques why tis good to be sad and say nothing
rosalind why then tis good to be a post
jaques i have neither the scholar's melancholy which is
 emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical
 nor the courtier's which is proud nor the
 soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's
 which is politic nor the lady's which is nice nor
 the lover's which is all these but it is a
 melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
 extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry's
 contemplation of my travels in which my often
 rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness
rosalind a traveller by my faith you have great reason to
 be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see
 other men's then to have seen much and to have
 nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
jaques yes i have gained my experience
rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have
 a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
 sad and to travel for it too
 enter orlando
orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind
jaques nay then god be wi you an you talk in blank verse
 exit
rosalind farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and
 wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
 own country be out of love with your nativity and
 almost chide god for making you that countenance you
 are or i will scarce think you have swam in a
 gondola why how now orlando where have you been
 all this while you a lover an you serve me such
 another trick never come in my sight more
orlando my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise
rosalind break an hour's promise in love he that will
 divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
 a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
 affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid
 hath clapped him o the shoulder but i'll warrant
 him heartwhole
orlando pardon me dear rosalind
rosalind nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i
 had as lief be wooed of a snail
orlando of a snail
rosalind ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
 carries his house on his head a better jointure
 i think than you make a woman besides he brings
 his destiny with him
orlando what's that
rosalind why horns which such as you are fain to be
 beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
 his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife
orlando virtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous
rosalind and i am your rosalind
celia it pleases him to call you so but he hath a
 rosalind of a better leer than you
rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday
 humour and like enough to consent what would you
 say to me now an i were your very very rosalind
orlando i would kiss before i spoke
rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were
 gravelled for lack of matter you might take
 occasion to kiss very good orators when they are
 out they will spit and for lovers lackinggod
 warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss
orlando how if the kiss be denied
rosalind then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter
orlando who could be out being before his beloved mistress
rosalind marry that should you if i were your mistress or
 i should think my honesty ranker than my wit
orlando what of my suit
rosalind not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
 am not i your rosalind
orlando i take some joy to say you are because i would be
 talking of her
rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you
orlando then in mine own person i die
rosalind no faith die by attorney the poor world is
 almost six thousand years old and in all this time
 there was not any man died in his own person
 videlicit in a lovecause troilus had his brains
 dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he
 could to die before and he is one of the patterns
 of love leander he would have lived many a fair
 year though hero had turned nun if it had not been
 for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
 but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being
 taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
 coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos'
 but these are all lies men have died from time to
 time and worms have eaten them but not for love
orlando i would not have my right rosalind of this mind
 for i protest her frown might kill me
rosalind by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now
 i will be your rosalind in a more comingon
 disposition and ask me what you will i will grant
 it
orlando then love me rosalind
rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all
orlando and wilt thou have me
rosalind ay and twenty such
orlando what sayest thou
rosalind are you not good
orlando i hope so
rosalind why then can one desire too much of a good thing
 come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
 give me your hand orlando what do you say sister
orlando pray thee marry us
celia i cannot say the words
rosalind you must begin will you orlando'
celia go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind
orlando i will
rosalind ay but when
orlando why now as fast as she can marry us
rosalind then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife'
orlando i take thee rosalind for wife
rosalind i might ask you for your commission but i do take
 thee orlando for my husband there's a girl goes
 before the priest and certainly a woman's thought
 runs before her actions
orlando so do all thoughts they are winged
rosalind now tell me how long you would have her after you
 have possessed her
orlando for ever and a day
rosalind say a day without the ever no no orlando
 men are april when they woo december when they wed
 maids are may when they are maids but the sky
 changes when they are wives i will be more jealous
 of thee than a barbary cockpigeon over his hen
 more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
 newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
 than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana
 in the fountain and i will do that when you are
 disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and
 that when thou art inclined to sleep
orlando but will my rosalind do so
rosalind by my life she will do as i do
orlando o but she is wise
rosalind or else she could not have the wit to do this the
 wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's
 wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
 twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly
 with the smoke out at the chimney
orlando a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say
 wit whither wilt'
rosalind nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met
 your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed
orlando and what wit could wit have to excuse that
rosalind marry to say she came to seek you there you shall
 never take her without her answer unless you take
 her without her tongue o that woman that cannot
 make her fault her husband's occasion let her
 never nurse her child herself for she will breed
 it like a fool
orlando for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee
rosalind alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours
orlando i must attend the duke at dinner by two o'clock i
 will be with thee again
rosalind ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you
 would prove my friends told me as much and i
 thought no less that flattering tongue of yours
 won me tis but one cast away and so come
 death two o'clock is your hour
orlando ay sweet rosalind
rosalind by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend
 me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous
 if you break one jot of your promise or come one
 minute behind your hour i will think you the most
 pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover
 and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that
 may be chosen out of the gross band of the
 unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep
 your promise

 rosalind so adieu
rosalind well time is the old justice that examines all such
 offenders and let time try adieu

 head and show the world what the bird hath done to
 her own nest
rosalind o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou
 didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but
 it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown
 bottom like the bay of portugal
celia or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour
 affection in it runs out
rosalind no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot
 of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness
 that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
 because his own are out let him be judge how deep i
 am in love i'll tell thee aliena i cannot be out
 of the sight of orlando i'll go find a shadow and
 sigh till he come

 enter silvius
silvius my errand is to you fair youth
 my gentle phebe bid me give you this
 i know not the contents but as i guess
 by the stern brow and waspish action
 which she did use as she was writing of it
 it bears an angry tenor pardon me
 i am but as a guiltless messenger
rosalind patience herself would startle at this letter
 and play the swaggerer bear this bear all
 she says i am not fair that i lack manners
 she calls me proud and that she could not love me
 were man as rare as phoenix od's my will
 her love is not the hare that i do hunt
 why writes she so to me well shepherd well
 this is a letter of your own device
silvius no i protest i know not the contents
 phebe did write it
rosalind come come you are a fool
 and turn'd into the extremity of love
 i saw her hand she has a leathern hand
 a freestonecolour'd hand i verily did think
 that her old gloves were on but twas her hands
 she has a huswife's hand but that's no matter
 i say she never did invent this letter
 this is a man's invention and his hand
silvius sure it is hers
rosalind why tis a boisterous and a cruel style
 a style forchallengers why she defies me
 like turk to christian women's gentle brain
 could not drop forth such giantrude invention
 such ethiope words blacker in their effect
 than in their countenance will you hear the letter
silvius so please you for i never heard it yet
 yet heard too much of phebe's cruelty
rosalind she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
 reads
 art thou god to shepherd turn'd
 that a maiden's heart hath burn'd
 can a woman rail thus
silvius call you this railing
rosalind reads
 why thy godhead laid apart
 warr'st thou with a woman's heart
 did you ever hear such railing
 whiles the eye of man did woo me
 that could do no vengeance to me
 meaning me a beast
 if the scorn of your bright eyne
 have power to raise such love in mine
 alack in me what strange effect
 would they work in mild aspect
 whiles you chid me i did love
 how then might your prayers move
 he that brings this love to thee
 little knows this love in me
 and by him seal up thy mind
 whether that thy youth and kind
 will the faithful offer take
 of me and all that i can make
 or else by him my love deny
 and then i'll study how to die
silvius call you this chiding
celia alas poor shepherd
rosalind do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt
 thou love such a woman what to make thee an
 instrument and play false strains upon thee not to
 be endured well go your way to her for i see
 love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to
 her that if she love me i charge her to love
 thee if she will not i will never have her unless
 thou entreat for her if you be a true lover
 hence and not a word for here comes more company

 enter oliver
oliver good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
 where in the purlieus of this forest stands
 a sheepcote fenced about with olive trees
celia west of this place down in the neighbour bottom
 the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
 left on your right hand brings you to the place
 but at this hour the house doth keep itself
 there's none within
oliver if that an eye may profit by a tongue
 then should i know you by description
 such garments and such years the boy is fair
 of female favour and bestows himself
 like a ripe sister the woman low
 and browner than her brother are not you
 the owner of the house i did inquire for
celia it is no boast being ask'd to say we are
oliver orlando doth commend him to you both
 and to that youth he calls his rosalind
 he sends this bloody napkin are you he
rosalind i am what must we understand by this
oliver some of my shame if you will know of me
 what man i am and how and why and where
 this handkercher was stain'd
celia i pray you tell it
oliver when last the young orlando parted from you
 he left a promise to return again
 within an hour and pacing through the forest
 chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
 lo what befell he threw his eye aside
 and mark what object did present itself
 under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age
 and high top bald with dry antiquity
 a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair
 lay sleeping on his back about his neck
 a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
 who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
 the opening of his mouth but suddenly
 seeing orlando it unlink'd itself
 and with indented glides did slip away
 into a bush under which bush's shade
 a lioness with udders all drawn dry
 lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
 when that the sleeping man should stir for tis
 the royal disposition of that beast
 to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
 this seen orlando did approach the man
 and found it was his brother his elder brother
celia o i have heard him speak of that same brother
 and he did render him the most unnatural
 that lived amongst men
oliver and well he might so do
 for well i know he was unnatural
rosalind but to orlando did he leave him there
 food to the suck'd and hungry lioness
oliver twice did he turn his back and purposed so
 but kindness nobler ever than revenge
 and nature stronger than his just occasion
 made him give battle to the lioness
 who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
 from miserable slumber i awaked
celia are you his brother
rosalind wast you he rescued
celia was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him
oliver twas i but tis not i i do not shame
 to tell you what i was since my conversion
 so sweetly tastes being the thing i am
rosalind but for the bloody napkin
oliver by and by
 when from the first to last betwixt us two
 tears our recountments had most kindly bathed
 as how i came into that desert place
 in brief he led me to the gentle duke
 who gave me fresh array and entertainment
 committing me unto my brother's love
 who led me instantly unto his cave
 there stripp'd himself and here upon his arm
 the lioness had torn some flesh away
 which all this while had bled and now he fainted
 and cried in fainting upon rosalind
 brief i recover'd him bound up his wound
 and after some small space being strong at heart
 he sent me hither stranger as i am
 to tell this story that you might excuse
 his broken promise and to give this napkin
 dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
 that he in sport doth call his rosalind
 rosalind swoons
celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede
oliver many will swoon when they do look on blood
celia there is more in it cousin ganymede
oliver look he recovers
rosalind i would i were at home
celia we'll lead you thither
 i pray you will you take him by the arm
oliver be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a
 man's heart
rosalind i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would
 think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell
 your brother how well i counterfeited heighho
oliver this was not counterfeit there is too great
 testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
 of earnest
rosalind counterfeit i assure you
oliver well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
rosalind so i do but i faith i should have been a woman by right
celia come you look paler and paler pray you draw
 homewards good sir go with us
oliver that will i for i must bear answer back
 how you excuse my brother rosalind
rosalind i shall devise something but i pray you commend
 my counterfeiting to him will you go

rosalind o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee
 wear thy heart in a scarf
orlando it is my arm

 of a lion
orlando wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady
rosalind did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to
 swoon when he showed me your handkerchief
orlando ay and greater wonders than that
rosalind o i know where you are nay tis true there was
 never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
 and caesar's thrasonical brag of i came saw and
 overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner
 met but they looked no sooner looked but they
 loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
 sighed but they asked one another the reason no
 sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy
 and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
 to marriage which they will climb incontinent or
 else be incontinent before marriage they are in
 the very wrath of love and they will together clubs
 cannot part them
orlando they shall be married tomorrow and i will bid the
 duke to the nuptial but o how bitter a thing it
 is to look into happiness through another man's
 eyes by so much the more shall i tomorrow be at

 think my brother happy in having what he wishes for
rosalind why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind

 yourself good and not to grace me believe then if
 you please that i can do strange things i have

 magician most profound in his art and yet not
 damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart

 marries aliena shall you marry her i know into
 what straits of fortune she is driven and it is
 not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient
 to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
 as she is and without any danger

 you'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd

duke senior i do remember in this shepherd boy
 some lively touches of my daughter's favour

jaques good my lord bid him welcome this is the
 motleyminded gentleman that i have so often met in
 the forest he hath been a courtier he swears
touchstone if any man doubt that let him put me to my
 purgation i have trod a measure i have flattered
 a lady i have been politic with my friend smooth
 with mine enemy i have undone three tailors i have
 had four quarrels and like to have fought one
jaques and how was that ta'en up
touchstone faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the
 seventh cause
jaques how seventh cause good my lord like this fellow
duke senior i like him very well
touchstone god ild you sir i desire you of the like i
 press in here sir amongst the rest of the country
 copulatives to swear and to forswear according as
 marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin
 sir an illfavoured thing sir but mine own a poor
 humour of mine sir to take that that no man else
 will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a
 poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster
duke senior by my faith he is very swift and sententious
touchstone according to the fool's bolt sir and such dulcet diseases
jaques but for the seventh cause how did you find the
 quarrel on the seventh cause
touchstone upon a lie seven times removedbear your body more
 seeming audreyas thus sir i did dislike the
 cut of a certain courtier's beard he sent me word
 if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the
 mind it was this is called the retort courteous
 if i sent him word again it was not well cut he
 would send me word he cut it to please himself
 this is called the quip modest if again it was
 not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
 called the reply churlish if again it was not
 well cut he would answer i spake not true this
 is called the reproof valiant if again it was not
 well cut he would say i lied this is called the
 countercheque quarrelsome and so to the lie
 circumstantial and the lie direct
jaques and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut
touchstone i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial
 nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we
 measured swords and parted
jaques can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie
touchstone o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
 books for good manners i will name you the degrees
 the first the retort courteous the second the
 quip modest the third the reply churlish the
 fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the
 countercheque quarrelsome the sixth the lie with
 circumstance the seventh the lie direct all
 these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may
 avoid that too with an if i knew when seven
 justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
 parties were met themselves one of them thought but
 of an if as if you said so then i said so and
 they shook hands and swore brothers your if is the
 only peacemaker much virtue in if
jaques is not this a rare fellow my lord he's as good at
 any thing and yet a fool

 the presentation of that he shoots his wit

 enter jaques de boys
jaques de boys let me have audience for a word or two
 i am the second son of old sir rowland
 that bring these tidings to this fair assembly
 duke frederick hearing how that every day
 men of great worth resorted to this forest
 address'd a mighty power which were on foot
 in his own conduct purposely to take
 his brother here and put him to the sword
 and to the skirts of this wild wood he came
 where meeting with an old religious man
 after some question with him was converted
 both from his enterprise and from the world
 his crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother
 and all their lands restored to them again
 that were with him exiled this to be true
 i do engage my life
duke senior welcome young man
 thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers wedding
 to one his lands withheld and to the other
 a land itself at large a potent dukedom
 first in this forest let us do those ends
 that here were well begun and well begot
 and after every of this happy number
 that have endured shrewd days and nights with us
 shall share the good of our returned fortune
 according to the measure of their states
 meantime forget this newfall'n dignity
 and fall into our rustic revelry
 play music and you brides and bridegrooms all
 with measure heap'd in joy to the measures fall
jaques sir by your patience if i heard you rightly
 the duke hath put on a religious life
 and thrown into neglect the pompous court
jaques de boys he hath
jaques to him will i out of these convertites
 there is much matter to be heard and learn'd

 your patience and your virtue well deserves it

 epilogue
rosalind it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue
 but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
 the prologue if it be true that good wine needs
 no bush tis true that a good play needs no
 epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes
 and good plays prove the better by the help of good
 epilogues what a case am i in then that am
 neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
 you in the behalf of a good play i am not
 furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not
 become me my way is to conjure you and i'll begin
 with the women i charge you o women for the love
 you bear to men to like as much of this play as
 please you and i charge you o men for the love
 you bear to womenas i perceive by your simpering
 none of you hates themthat between you and the
 women the play may please if i were a woman i
 would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
 me complexions that liked me and breaths that i
 defied not and i am sure as many as have good
 beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my
 kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell

 to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more
 if any born at ephesus be seen
 at any syracusian marts and fairs
 again if any syracusian born
 come to the bay of ephesus he dies
 his goods confiscate to the duke's dispose
 unless a thousand marks be levied
 to quit the penalty and to ransom him
 thy substance valued at the highest rate
 cannot amount unto a hundred marks
 therefore by law thou art condemned to die
aegeon yet this my comfort when your words are done
 my woes end likewise with the evening sun
duke solinus well syracusian say in brief the cause
 why thou departed'st from thy native home
 and for what cause thou camest to ephesus
aegeon a heavier task could not have been imposed
 than i to speak my griefs unspeakable
 yet that the world may witness that my end
 was wrought by nature not by vile offence
 i'll utter what my sorrows give me leave
 in syracusa was i born and wed
 unto a woman happy but for me
 and by me had not our hap been bad
 with her i lived in joy our wealth increased
 by prosperous voyages i often made
 to epidamnum till my factor's death
 and the great care of goods at random left
 drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
 from whom my absence was not six months old
 before herself almost at fainting under
 the pleasing punishment that women bear
 had made provision for her following me
 and soon and safe arrived where i was
 there had she not been long but she became
 a joyful mother of two goodly sons
 and which was strange the one so like the other
 as could not be distinguish'd but by names
 that very hour and in the selfsame inn
 a meaner woman was delivered
 of such a burden male twins both alike
 thosefor their parents were exceeding poor
 i bought and brought up to attend my sons
 my wife not meanly proud of two such boys
 made daily motions for our home return
 unwilling i agreed alas too soon
 we came aboard
 a league from epidamnum had we sail'd
 before the always windobeying deep
 gave any tragic instance of our harm
 but longer did we not retain much hope
 for what obscured light the heavens did grant
 did but convey unto our fearful minds
 a doubtful warrant of immediate death
 which though myself would gladly have embraced
 yet the incessant weepings of my wife
 weeping before for what she saw must come
 and piteous plainings of the pretty babes
 that mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear
 forced me to seek delays for them and me
 and this it was for other means was none
 the sailors sought for safety by our boat
 and left the ship then sinkingripe to us
 my wife more careful for the latterborn
 had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast
 such as seafaring men provide for storms
 to him one of the other twins was bound
 whilst i had been like heedful of the other
 the children thus disposed my wife and i
 fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd
 fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast
 and floating straight obedient to the stream
 was carried towards corinth as we thought
 at length the sun gazing upon the earth
 dispersed those vapours that offended us
 and by the benefit of his wished light
 the seas wax'd calm and we discovered
 two ships from far making amain to us
 of corinth that of epidaurus this
 but ere they cameo let me say no more
 gather the sequel by that went before
duke solinus nay forward old man do not break off so
 for we may pity though not pardon thee
aegeon o had the gods done so i had not now
 worthily term'd them merciless to us
 for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
 we were encounterd by a mighty rock
 which being violently borne upon
 our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
 so that in this unjust divorce of us
 fortune had left to both of us alike
 what to delight in what to sorrow for
 her part poor soul seeming as burdened
 with lesser weight but not with lesser woe
 was carried with more speed before the wind
 and in our sight they three were taken up
 by fishermen of corinth as we thought
 at length another ship had seized on us
 and knowing whom it was their hap to save
 gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests
 and would have reft the fishers of their prey
 had not their bark been very slow of sail
 and therefore homeward did they bend their course
 thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss
 that by misfortunes was my life prolong'd
 to tell sad stories of my own mishaps
duke solinus and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
 do me the favour to dilate at full
 what hath befall'n of them and thee till now
aegeon my youngest boy and yet my eldest care
 at eighteen years became inquisitive
 after his brother and importuned me
 that his attendantso his case was like
 reft of his brother but retain'd his name
 might bear him company in the quest of him
 whom whilst i labour'd of a love to see
 i hazarded the loss of whom i loved
 five summers have i spent in furthest greece
 roaming clean through the bounds of asia
 and coasting homeward came to ephesus
 hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
 or that or any place that harbours men
 but here must end the story of my life
 and happy were i in my timely death
 could all my travels warrant me they live
duke solinus hapless aegeon whom the fates have mark'd
 to bear the extremity of dire mishap
 now trust me were it not against our laws
 against my crown my oath my dignity
 which princes would they may not disannul
 my soul would sue as advocate for thee
 but though thou art adjudged to the death
 and passed sentence may not be recall'd
 but to our honour's great disparagement
 yet i will favour thee in what i can
 therefore merchant i'll limit thee this day
 to seek thy life by beneficial help
 try all the friends thou hast in ephesus
 beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
 and live if no then thou art doom'd to die
 gaoler take him to thy custody
gaoler i will my lord
aegeon hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend
 but to procrastinate his lifeless end

 here comes the almanac of my true date
 what now how chance thou art return'd so soon
dromio of ephesus return'd so soon rather approach'd too late
 the capon burns the pig falls from the spit
 the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell
 my mistress made it one upon my cheek
 she is so hot because the meat is cold
 the meat is cold because you come not home
 you come not home because you have no stomach
 you have no stomach having broke your fast
 but we that know what tis to fast and pray

of syracuse upon my life by some device or other
 the villain is o'erraught of all my money

 darkworking sorcerers that change the mind
 soulkilling witches that deform the body
 disguised cheaters prating mountebanks

scene i the house of antipholus of ephesus
 enter adriana and luciana
adriana neither my husband nor the slave return'd
 that in such haste i sent to seek his master
 sure luciana it is two o'clock
luciana perhaps some merchant hath invited him
 and from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner
 good sister let us dine and never fret
 a man is master of his liberty
 time is their master and when they see time
 they'll go or come if so be patient sister
adriana why should their liberty than ours be more
luciana because their business still lies out o door
adriana look when i serve him so he takes it ill
luciana o know he is the bridle of your will
adriana there's none but asses will be bridled so
luciana why headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe
 there's nothing situate under heaven's eye
 but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
 the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
 are their males subjects and at their controls
 men more divine the masters of all these
 lords of the wide world and wild watery seas
 indued with intellectual sense and souls
 of more preeminence than fish and fowls
 are masters to their females and their lords
 then let your will attend on their accords
adriana this servitude makes you to keep unwed
luciana not this but troubles of the marriagebed
adriana but were you wedded you would bear some sway
luciana ere i learn love i'll practise to obey
adriana how if your husband start some other where
luciana till he come home again i would forbear
adriana patience unmoved no marvel though she pause
 they can be meek that have no other cause
 a wretched soul bruised with adversity
 we bid be quiet when we hear it cry
 but were we burdened with like weight of pain
 as much or more would we ourselves complain
 so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
 with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me
 but if thou live to see like right bereft
 this foolbegg'd patience in thee will be left
luciana well i will marry one day but to try
 here comes your man now is your husband nigh
 enter dromio of ephesus
adriana say is your tardy master now at hand
dromio of ephesus nay he's at two hands with me and that my two ears
 can witness
adriana say didst thou speak with him know'st thou his mind
dromio of ephesus ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
 beshrew his hand i scarce could understand it
luciana spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning
dromio of ephesus nay he struck so plainly i could too well feel his
 blows and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce
 understand them
adriana but say i prithee is he coming home it seems he
 hath great care to please his wife
dromio of ephesus why mistress sure my master is hornmad
adriana hornmad thou villain
dromio of ephesus i mean not cuckoldmad
 but sure he is stark mad
 when i desired him to come home to dinner
 he ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold
 'tis dinnertime quoth i my gold quoth he
 your meat doth burn quoth i my gold quoth he
 will you come home quoth i my gold quoth he
 where is the thousand marks i gave thee villain'
 the pig quoth i is burn'd my gold quoth he
 my mistress sir quoth i hang up thy mistress
 i know not thy mistress out on thy mistress'
luciana quoth who
dromio of ephesus quoth my master
 i know quoth he no house no wife no mistress'
 so that my errand due unto my tongue
 i thank him i bare home upon my shoulders
 for in conclusion he did beat me there
adriana go back again thou slave and fetch him home
dromio of ephesus go back again and be new beaten home
 for god's sake send some other messenger
adriana back slave or i will break thy pate across
dromio of ephesus and he will bless that cross with other beating
 between you i shall have a holy head
adriana hence prating peasant fetch thy master home
dromio of ephesus am i so round with you as you with me
 that like a football you do spurn me thus
 you spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
 if i last in this service you must case me in leather
 exit
luciana fie how impatience loureth in your face
adriana his company must do his minions grace
 whilst i at home starve for a merry look
 hath homely age the alluring beauty took
 from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it
 are my discourses dull barren my wit
 if voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd
 unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
 do their gay vestments his affections bait
 that's not my fault he's master of my state
 what ruins are in me that can be found
 by him not ruin'd then is he the ground
 of my defeatures my decayed fair
 a sunny look of his would soon repair
 but too unruly deer he breaks the pale
 and feeds from home poor i am but his stale
luciana selfharming jealousy fie beat it hence
adriana unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
 i know his eye doth homage otherwhere
 or else what lets it but he would be here
 sister you know he promised me a chain
 would that alone alone he would detain
 so he would keep fair quarter with his bed
 i see the jewel best enamelled
 will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
 that others touch and often touching will
 wear gold and no man that hath a name
 by falsehood and corruption doth it shame
 since that my beauty cannot please his eye
 i'll weep what's left away and weeping die

of syracuse even now even here not half an hour since
dromio of syracuse i did not see you since you sent me hence
 home to the centaur with the gold you gave me
antipholus
of syracuse villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt
 and told'st me of a mistress and a dinner
 for which i hope thou felt'st i was displeased
dromio of syracuse i am glad to see you in this merry vein
 what means this jest i pray you master tell me
antipholus
of syracuse yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
 think'st thou i jest hold take thou that and that
 beating him
dromio of syracuse hold sir for god's sake now your jest is earnest
 upon what bargain do you give it me
antipholus
of syracuse because that i familiarly sometimes
 do use you for my fool and chat with you
 your sauciness will jest upon my love
 and make a common of my serious hours
 when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
 but creep in crannies when he hides his beams
 if you will jest with me know my aspect
 and fashion your demeanor to my looks
 or i will beat this method in your sconce
dromio of syracuse sconce call you it so you would leave battering i
 had rather have it a head an you use these blows
 long i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
 it too or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders
 but i pray sir why am i beaten
antipholus
of syracuse dost thou not know
dromio of syracuse nothing sir but that i am beaten
antipholus
of syracuse shall i tell you why
dromio of syracuse ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath
 a wherefore
antipholus
of syracuse why firstfor flouting me and then wherefore
 for urging it the second time to me
dromio of syracuse was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
 when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
 nor reason
 well sir i thank you
antipholus
of syracuse thank me sir for what
dromio of syracuse marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing
antipholus
of syracuse i'll make you amends next to give you nothing for
 something but say sir is it dinnertime
dromio of syracuse no sir i think the meat wants that i have
antipholus
of syracuse in good time sir what's that
dromio of syracuse basting
antipholus
of syracuse well sir then twill be dry
dromio of syracuse if it be sir i pray you eat none of it
antipholus
of syracuse your reason
dromio of syracuse lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
 dry basting
antipholus
of syracuse well sir learn to jest in good time there's a
 time for all things
dromio of syracuse i durst have denied that before you were so choleric
antipholus
of syracuse by what rule sir
dromio of syracuse marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald
 pate of father time himself
antipholus
of syracuse let's hear it
dromio of syracuse there's no time for a man to recover his hair that
 grows bald by nature
antipholus
of syracuse may he not do it by fine and recovery
dromio of syracuse yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
 lost hair of another man
antipholus
of syracuse why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is
 so plentiful an excrement
dromio of syracuse because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts
 and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit
antipholus
of syracuse why but there's many a man hath more hair than wit
dromio of syracuse not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair
antipholus
of syracuse why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit
dromio of syracuse the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth
 it in a kind of jollity
antipholus
of syracuse for what reason
dromio of syracuse for two and sound ones too
antipholus
of syracuse nay not sound i pray you
dromio of syracuse sure ones then
antipholus
of syracuse nay not sure in a thing falsing
dromio of syracuse certain ones then
antipholus
of syracuse name them
dromio of syracuse the one to save the money that he spends in
 trimming the other that at dinner they should not
 drop in his porridge
antipholus
of syracuse you would all this time have proved there is no
 time for all things
dromio of syracuse marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair
 lost by nature
antipholus
of syracuse but your reason was not substantial why there is no
 time to recover
dromio of syracuse thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore
 to the world's end will have bald followers
antipholus
of syracuse i knew twould be a bald conclusion
 but soft who wafts us yonder
 enter adriana and luciana
adriana ay ay antipholus look strange and frown
 some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
 i am not adriana nor thy wife
 the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
 that never words were music to thine ear
 that never object pleasing in thine eye
 that never touch well welcome to thy hand
 that never meat sweetsavor'd in thy taste
 unless i spake or look'd or touch'd or carved to thee
 how comes it now my husband o how comes it
 that thou art thus estranged from thyself
 thyself i call it being strange to me
 that undividable incorporate
 am better than thy dear self's better part
 ah do not tear away thyself from me
 for know my love as easy mayest thou fall
 a drop of water in the breaking gulf
 and take unmingled that same drop again
 without addition or diminishing
 as take from me thyself and not me too
 how dearly would it touch me to the quick
 shouldst thou but hear i were licentious
 and that this body consecrate to thee
 by ruffian lust should be contaminate
 wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
 and hurl the name of husband in my face
 and tear the stain'd skin off my harlotbrow
 and from my false hand cut the weddingring
 and break it with a deepdivorcing vow
 i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
 i am possess'd with an adulterate blot
 my blood is mingled with the crime of lust
 for if we too be one and thou play false
 i do digest the poison of thy flesh
 being strumpeted by thy contagion
 keep then far league and truce with thy true bed
 i live unstain'd thou undishonoured
antipholus
of syracuse plead you to me fair dame i know you not
 in ephesus i am but two hours old
 as strange unto your town as to your talk
 who every word by all my wit being scann'd
 want wit in all one word to understand

 didst thou deliver to me on the mart
dromio of syracuse i never spake with her in all my life
antipholus
of syracuse how can she thus then call us by our names
 unless it be by inspiration
adriana how ill agrees it with your gravity
 to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
 abetting him to thwart me in my mood
 be it my wrong you are from me exempt
 but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
 come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine
 thou art an elm my husband i a vine
 whose weakness married to thy stronger state
 makes me with thy strength to communicate
 if aught possess thee from me it is dross
 usurping ivy brier or idle moss
 who all for want of pruning with intrusion
 infect thy sap and live on thy confusion
antipholus
of syracuse to me she speaks she moves me for her theme
 what was i married to her in my dream
 or sleep i now and think i hear all this
 what error drives our eyes and ears amiss
 until i know this sure uncertainty
 i'll entertain the offer'd fallacy
luciana dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
dromio of syracuse o for my beads i cross me for a sinner
 this is the fairy land o spite of spites
 we talk with goblins owls and sprites
 if we obey them not this will ensue

luciana if thou art changed to aught tis to an ass
dromio of syracuse tis true she rides me and i long for grass

adriana come come no longer will i be a fool

 and doubt not sir but she will well excuse
 why at this time the doors are made against you
 be ruled by me depart in patience

 now in the stirring passage of the day
 a vulgar comment will be made of it
 and that supposed by the common rout
 against your yet ungalled estimation
 that may with foul intrusion enter in
 and dwell upon your grave when you are dead
 for slander lives upon succession
 for ever housed where it gets possession
antipholus
of ephesus you have prevailed i will depart in quiet
 and in despite of mirth mean to be merry

act iii
scene ii the same
 enter luciana and antipholus of syracuse
luciana and may it be that you have quite forgot
 a husband's office shall antipholus
 even in the spring of love thy lovesprings rot
 shall love in building grow so ruinous
 if you did wed my sister for her wealth
 then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness
 or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
 muffle your false love with some show of blindness
 let not my sister read it in your eye
 be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator
 look sweet be fair become disloyalty
 apparel vice like virtue's harbinger
 bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
 teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
 be secretfalse what need she be acquainted
 what simple thief brags of his own attaint
 tis double wrong to truant with your bed
 and let her read it in thy looks at board
 shame hath a bastard fame well managed
 ill deeds are doubled with an evil word
 alas poor women make us but believe
 being compact of credit that you love us
 though others have the arm show us the sleeve
 we in your motion turn and you may move us
 then gentle brother get you in again
 comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
 tis holy sport to be a little vain
 when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
antipholus
of syracuse sweet mistresswhat your name is else i know not
 nor by what wonder you do hit of mine
 less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
 than our earth's wonder more than earth divine
 teach me dear creature how to think and speak
 lay open to my earthygross conceit
 smother'd in errors feeble shallow weak
 the folded meaning of your words deceit
 against my soul's pure truth why labour you
 to make it wander in an unknown field
 are you a god would you create me new
 transform me then and to your power i'll yield
 but if that i am i then well i know
 your weeping sister is no wife of mine
 nor to her bed no homage do i owe
 far more far more to you do i decline
 o train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
 to drown me in thy sister's flood of tears
 sing siren for thyself and i will dote
 spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs
 and as a bed i'll take them and there lie
 and in that glorious supposition think
 he gains by death that hath such means to die
 let love being light be drowned if she sink
luciana what are you mad that you do reason so
antipholus
of syracuse not mad but mated how i do not know
luciana it is a fault that springeth from your eye
antipholus
of syracuse for gazing on your beams fair sun being by
luciana gaze where you should and that will clear your sight
antipholus
of syracuse as good to wink sweet love as look on night
luciana why call you me love call my sister so
antipholus
of syracuse thy sister's sister
luciana that's my sister
antipholus
of syracuse no
 it is thyself mine own self's better part
 mine eye's clear eye my dear heart's dearer heart
 my food my fortune and my sweet hope's aim
 my sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim
luciana all this my sister is or else should be
antipholus
of syracuse call thyself sister sweet for i am thee
 thee will i love and with thee lead my life
 thou hast no husband yet nor i no wife

 wondrous fat marriage

 lamp of her and run from her by her own light i

 poland winter if she lives till doomsday
 she'll burn a week longer than the whole world
antipholus

dromio of syracuse no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip
 she is spherical like a globe i could find out
 countries in her
antipholus

antipholus

 aspect to the hot breath of spain who sent whole
 armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose

 drudge or diviner laid claim to me call'd me
 dromio swore i was assured to her told me what
 privy marks i had about me as the mark of my
 shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my
 left arm that i amazed ran from her as a witch
 and i think if my breast had not been made of
 faith and my heart of steel
 she had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
 me turn i the wheel
antipholus
of syracuse go hie thee presently post to the road
 an if the wind blow any way from shore
 i will not harbour in this town tonight
 if any bark put forth come to the mart

dromio of syracuse as from a bear a man would run for life
 so fly i from her that would be my wife
 exit
antipholus
of syracuse there's none but witches do inhabit here
 and therefore tis high time that i were hence
 she that doth call me husband even my soul
 doth for a wife abhor but her fair sister
 possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace
 of such enchanting presence and discourse
 hath almost made me traitor to myself
 but lest myself be guilty to selfwrong
 i'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song

 besides this present instance of his rage
 is a mad tale he told today at dinner
 of his own doors being shut against his entrance
 belike his wife acquainted with his fits
 on purpose shut the doors against his way
 my way is now to hie home to his house
 and tell his wife that being lunatic
 he rush'd into my house and took perforce

dromio of ephesus in verity you did my bones bear witness
 that since have felt the vigour of his rage
adriana is't good to soothe him in these contraries
pinch it is no shame the fellow finds his vein
 and yielding to him humours well his frenzy

adriana alas i sent you money to redeem you
 by dromio here who came in haste for it
dromio of ephesus money by me heart and goodwill you might

dromio of ephesus god and the ropemaker bear me witness
 that i was sent for nothing but a rope
pinch mistress both man and master is possess'd

antipholus

antipholus

 therefore away to get our stuff aboard
 exeunt
 the comedy of errors
act v
scene i a street before a priory
 enter second merchant and angelo
angelo i am sorry sir that i have hinder'd you
 but i protest he had the chain of me
 though most dishonestly he doth deny it
second merchant how is the man esteemed here in the city
angelo of very reverend reputation sir
 of credit infinite highly beloved
 second to none that lives here in the city
 his word might bear my wealth at any time
second merchant speak softly yonder as i think he walks
 enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
angelo tis so and that self chain about his neck
 which he forswore most monstrously to have
 good sir draw near to me i'll speak to him
 signior antipholus i wonder much
 that you would put me to this shame and trouble
 and not without some scandal to yourself
 with circumstance and oaths so to deny
 this chain which now you wear so openly
 beside the charge the shame imprisonment
 you have done wrong to this my honest friend
 who but for staying on our controversy
 had hoisted sail and put to sea today
 this chain you had of me can you deny it
antipholus
of syracuse i think i had i never did deny it
second merchant yes that you did sir and forswore it too
antipholus
of syracuse who heard me to deny it or forswear it
second merchant these ears of mine thou know'st did hear thee
 fie on thee wretch tis pity that thou livest
 to walk where any honest man resort
antipholus
of syracuse thou art a villain to impeach me thus
 i'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
 against thee presently if thou darest stand
second merchant i dare and do defy thee for a villain
 they draw
 enter adriana luciana the courtezan and others
adriana hold hurt him not for god's sake he is mad
 some get within him take his sword away
 bind dromio too and bear them to my house
dromio of syracuse run master run for god's sake take a house
 this is some priory in or we are spoil'd
 exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
 to the priory
 enter the lady abbess aemilia
aemelia be quiet people wherefore throng you hither
adriana to fetch my poor distracted husband hence
 let us come in that we may bind him fast
 and bear him home for his recovery
angelo i knew he was not in his perfect wits
second merchant i am sorry now that i did draw on him
aemelia how long hath this possession held the man
adriana this week he hath been heavy sour sad
 and much different from the man he was
 but till this afternoon his passion
 ne'er brake into extremity of rage
aemelia hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
 buried some dear friend hath not else his eye
 stray'd his affection in unlawful love
 a sin prevailing much in youthful men
 who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
 which of these sorrows is he subject to
adriana to none of these except it be the last
 namely some love that drew him oft from home
aemelia you should for that have reprehended him
adriana why so i did
aemelia ay but not rough enough
adriana as roughly as my modesty would let me
aemelia haply in private
adriana and in assemblies too
aemelia ay but not enough
adriana it was the copy of our conference
 in bed he slept not for my urging it
 at board he fed not for my urging it
 alone it was the subject of my theme
 in company i often glanced it
 still did i tell him it was vile and bad
aemelia and thereof came it that the man was mad
 the venom clamours of a jealous woman
 poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth
 it seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing
 and therefore comes it that his head is light
 thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings
 unquiet meals make ill digestions
 thereof the raging fire of fever bred
 and what's a fever but a fit of madness
 thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls
 sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue
 but moody and dull melancholy
 kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
 and at her heels a huge infectious troop
 of pale distemperatures and foes to life
 in food in sport and lifepreserving rest
 to be disturb'd would mad or man or beast
 the consequence is then thy jealous fits
 have scared thy husband from the use of wits
luciana she never reprehended him but mildly
 when he demean'd himself rough rude and wildly
 why bear you these rebukes and answer not
adriana she did betray me to my own reproof
 good people enter and lay hold on him
aemelia no not a creature enters in my house
adriana then let your servants bring my husband forth
aemelia neither he took this place for sanctuary
 and it shall privilege him from your hands
 till i have brought him to his wits again
 or lose my labour in assaying it
adriana i will attend my husband be his nurse
 diet his sickness for it is my office
 and will have no attorney but myself
 and therefore let me have him home with me
aemelia be patient for i will not let him stir
 till i have used the approved means i have
 with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
 to make of him a formal man again
 it is a branch and parcel of mine oath
 a charitable duty of my order
 therefore depart and leave him here with me
adriana i will not hence and leave my husband here
 and ill it doth beseem your holiness
 to separate the husband and the wife
aemelia be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him
 exit
luciana complain unto the duke of this indignity
adriana come go i will fall prostrate at his feet
 and never rise until my tears and prayers
 have won his grace to come in person hither
 and take perforce my husband from the abbess
second merchant by this i think the dial points at five
 anon i'm sure the duke himself in person
 comes this way to the melancholy vale
 the place of death and sorry execution
 behind the ditches of the abbey here
angelo upon what cause
second merchant to see a reverend syracusian merchant
 who put unluckily into this bay
 against the laws and statutes of this town
 beheaded publicly for his offence
angelo see where they come we will behold his death
luciana kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey
 enter duke solinus attended aegeon bareheaded with the
 headsman and other officers
duke solinus yet once again proclaim it publicly
 if any friend will pay the sum for him
 he shall not die so much we tender him
adriana justice most sacred duke against the abbess
duke solinus she is a virtuous and a reverend lady
 it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
adriana may it please your grace antipholus my husband
 whom i made lord of me and all i had
 at your important lettersthis ill day
 a most outrageous fit of madness took him
 that desperately he hurried through the street
 with him his bondman all as mad as he
 doing displeasure to the citizens
 by rushing in their houses bearing thence
 rings jewels any thing his rage did like
 once did i get him bound and sent him home
 whilst to take order for the wrongs i went
 that here and there his fury had committed
 anon i wot not by what strong escape
 he broke from those that had the guard of him
 and with his mad attendant and himself
 each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
 met us again and madly bent on us
 chased us away till raising of more aid
 we came again to bind them then they fled
 into this abbey whither we pursued them
 and here the abbess shuts the gates on us
 and will not suffer us to fetch him out
 nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
 therefore most gracious duke with thy command
 let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
duke solinus long since thy husband served me in my wars
 and i to thee engaged a prince's word
 when thou didst make him master of thy bed
 to do him all the grace and good i could
 go some of you knock at the abbeygate
 and bid the lady abbess come to me
 i will determine this before i stir
 enter a servant
servant o mistress mistress shift and save yourself
 my master and his man are both broke loose
 beaten the maids arow and bound the doctor
 whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire
 and ever as it blazed they threw on him
 great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
 my master preaches patience to him and the while
 his man with scissors nicks him like a fool
 and sure unless you send some present help
 between them they will kill the conjurer
adriana peace fool thy master and his man are here
 and that is false thou dost report to us
servant mistress upon my life i tell you true
 i have not breathed almost since i did see it
 he cries for you and vows if he can take you
 to scorch your face and to disfigure you
 cry within
 hark hark i hear him mistress fly be gone
duke solinus come stand by me fear nothing guard with halberds
adriana ay me it is my husband witness you
 that he is borne about invisible
 even now we housed him in the abbey here
 and now he's there past thought of human reason
 enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus
antipholus
of ephesus justice most gracious duke o grant me justice
 even for the service that long since i did thee
 when i bestrid thee in the wars and took
 deep scars to save thy life even for the blood
 that then i lost for thee now grant me justice
aegeon unless the fear of death doth make me dote
 i see my son antipholus and dromio
antipholus
of ephesus justice sweet prince against that woman there
 she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife
 that hath abused and dishonour'd me
 even in the strength and height of injury
 beyond imagination is the wrong
 that she this day hath shameless thrown on me
duke solinus discover how and thou shalt find me just
antipholus
of ephesus this day great duke she shut the doors upon me
 while she with harlots feasted in my house
duke solinus a grievous fault say woman didst thou so
adriana no my good lord myself he and my sister
 today did dine together so befall my soul
 as this is false he burdens me withal
luciana ne'er may i look on day nor sleep on night
 but she tells to your highness simple truth
angelo o perjured woman they are both forsworn
 in this the madman justly chargeth them
antipholus
of ephesus my liege i am advised what i say
 neither disturbed with the effect of wine
 nor headyrash provoked with raging ire
 albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
 this woman lock'd me out this day from dinner
 that goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her
 could witness it for he was with me then
 who parted with me to go fetch a chain
 promising to bring it to the porpentine
 where balthazar and i did dine together
 our dinner done and he not coming thither
 i went to seek him in the street i met him
 and in his company that gentleman
 there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
 that i this day of him received the chain
 which god he knows i saw not for the which
 he did arrest me with an officer
 i did obey and sent my peasant home
 for certain ducats he with none return'd
 then fairly i bespoke the officer
 to go in person with me to my house
 by the way we met
 my wife her sister and a rabble more
 of vile confederates along with them
 they brought one pinch a hungry leanfaced villain
 a mere anatomy a mountebank
 a threadbare juggler and a fortuneteller
 a needy holloweyed sharplooking wretch
 a deadlooking man this pernicious slave
 forsooth took on him as a conjurer
 and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
 and with no face as twere outfacing me
 cries out i was possess'd then all together
 they fell upon me bound me bore me thence
 and in a dark and dankish vault at home
 there left me and my man both bound together
 till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
 i gain'd my freedom and immediately
 ran hither to your grace whom i beseech
 to give me ample satisfaction
 for these deep shames and great indignities
angelo my lord in truth thus far i witness with him
 that he dined not at home but was lock'd out
duke solinus but had he such a chain of thee or no
angelo he had my lord and when he ran in here
 these people saw the chain about his neck
second merchant besides i will be sworn these ears of mine
 heard you confess you had the chain of him
 after you first forswore it on the mart
 and thereupon i drew my sword on you
 and then you fled into this abbey here
 from whence i think you are come by miracle
antipholus
of ephesus i never came within these abbeywalls
 nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
 i never saw the chain so help me heaven
 and this is false you burden me withal
duke solinus why what an intricate impeach is this
 i think you all have drunk of circe's cup
 if here you housed him here he would have been
 if he were mad he would not plead so coldly
 you say he dined at home the goldsmith here
 denies that saying sirrah what say you
dromio of ephesus sir he dined with her there at the porpentine
courtezan he did and from my finger snatch'd that ring
antipholus
of ephesus tis true my liege this ring i had of her
duke solinus saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here
courtezan as sure my liege as i do see your grace
duke solinus why this is strange go call the abbess hither
 i think you are all mated or stark mad
 exit one to abbess
aegeon most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word
 haply i see a friend will save my life
 and pay the sum that may deliver me
duke solinus speak freely syracusian what thou wilt
aegeon is not your name sir call'd antipholus
 and is not that your bondman dromio
dromio of ephesus within this hour i was his bondman sir
 but he i thank him gnaw'd in two my cords
 now am i dromio and his man unbound
aegeon i am sure you both of you remember me
dromio of ephesus ourselves we do remember sir by you
 for lately we were bound as you are now
 you are not pinch's patient are you sir
aegeon why look you strange on me you know me well
antipholus i never saw you in my life till now
aegeon o grief hath changed me since you saw me last
 and careful hours with time's deformed hand
 have written strange defeatures in my face
 but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
antipholus
of ephesus neither
aegeon dromio nor thou
dromio of ephesus no trust me sir nor i
aegeon i am sure thou dost
dromio of ephesus ay sir but i am sure i do not and whatsoever a
 man denies you are now bound to believe him
aegeon not know my voice o time's extremity
 hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
 in seven short years that here my only son
 knows not my feeble key of untuned cares
 though now this grained face of mine be hid
 in sapconsuming winter's drizzled snow
 and all the conduits of my blood froze up
 yet hath my night of life some memory
 my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
 my dull deaf ears a little use to hear
 all these old witnessesi cannot err
 tell me thou art my son antipholus
antipholus
of ephesus i never saw my father in my life
aegeon but seven years since in syracusa boy
 thou know'st we parted but perhaps my son
 thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery
antipholus
of ephesus the duke and all that know me in the city
 can witness with me that it is not so
 i ne'er saw syracusa in my life
duke solinus i tell thee syracusian twenty years
 have i been patron to antipholus
 during which time he ne'er saw syracusa
 i see thy age and dangers make thee dote
 reenter aemilia with antipholus of syracuse and
 dromio of syracuse
aemelia most mighty duke behold a man much wrong'd
 all gather to see them
adriana i see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me
duke solinus one of these men is genius to the other
 and so of these which is the natural man
 and which the spirit who deciphers them
dromio of syracuse i sir am dromio command him away
dromio of ephesus i sir am dromio pray let me stay
antipholus
of syracuse aegeon art thou not or else his ghost
dromio of syracuse o my old master who hath bound him here
aemelia whoever bound him i will loose his bonds
 and gain a husband by his liberty
 speak old aegeon if thou be'st the man
 that hadst a wife once call'd aemilia
 that bore thee at a burden two fair sons
 o if thou be'st the same aegeon speak
 and speak unto the same aemilia
aegeon if i dream not thou art aemilia
 if thou art she tell me where is that son
 that floated with thee on the fatal raft
aemelia by men of epidamnum he and i
 and the twin dromio all were taken up
 but by and by rude fishermen of corinth
 by force took dromio and my son from them
 and me they left with those of epidamnum
 what then became of them i cannot tell
 i to this fortune that you see me in
duke solinus why here begins his morning story right
 these two antipholuses these two so like
 and these two dromios one in semblance
 besides her urging of her wreck at sea
 these are the parents to these children
 which accidentally are met together
 antipholus thou camest from corinth first
antipholus
of syracuse no sir not i i came from syracuse

scene i britain the garden of cymbeline's palace
 enter two gentlemen
first gentleman you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods
 no more obey the heavens than our courtiers
 still seem as does the king
second gentleman but what's the matter
first gentleman his daughter and the heir of's kingdom whom
 he purposed to his wife's sole sona widow
 that late he marriedhath referr'd herself
 unto a poor but worthy gentleman she's wedded
 her husband banish'd she imprison'd all
 is outward sorrow though i think the king
 be touch'd at very heart
second gentleman none but the king
first gentleman he that hath lost her too so is the queen
 that most desired the match but not a courtier
 although they wear their faces to the bent
 of the king's look's hath a heart that is not
 glad at the thing they scowl at
second gentleman and why so
first gentleman he that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
 too bad for bad report and he that hath her
 i mean that married her alack good man
 and therefore banish'dis a creature such
 as to seek through the regions of the earth
 for one his like there would be something failing
 in him that should compare i do not think
 so fair an outward and such stuff within
 endows a man but he
second gentleman you speak him far
first gentleman i do extend him sir within himself
 crush him together rather than unfold
 his measure duly
second gentleman what's his name and birth
first gentleman i cannot delve him to the root his father
 was call'd sicilius who did join his honour
 against the romans with cassibelan
 but had his titles by tenantius whom
 he served with glory and admired success
 so gain'd the suraddition leonatus
 and had besides this gentleman in question
 two other sons who in the wars o the time
 died with their swords in hand for which
 their father
 then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
 that he quit being and his gentle lady
 big of this gentleman our theme deceased
 as he was born the king he takes the babe
 to his protection calls him posthumus leonatus
 breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber
 puts to him all the learnings that his time
 could make him the receiver of which he took
 as we do air fast as twas minister'd
 and in's spring became a harvest lived in court
 which rare it is to domost praised most loved
 a sample to the youngest to the more mature
 a glass that feated them and to the graver
 a child that guided dotards to his mistress
 for whom he now is banish'd her own price
 proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue
 by her election may be truly read
 what kind of man he is
second gentleman i honour him
 even out of your report but pray you tell me
 is she sole child to the king
first gentleman his only child
 he had two sons if this be worth your hearing
 mark it the eldest of them at three years old
 i the swathingclothes the other from their nursery
 were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge
 which way they went
second gentleman how long is this ago
first gentleman some twenty years
second gentleman that a king's children should be so convey'd
 so slackly guarded and the search so slow
 that could not trace them
first gentleman howsoe'er tis strange
 or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at
 yet is it true sir
second gentleman i do well believe you
first gentleman we must forbear here comes the gentleman
 the queen and princess
 exeunt

 so soon as i can win the offended king
 i will be known your advocate marry yet

cloten if my shirt were bloody then to shift it have i hurt him
second lord aside no faith not so much as his patience
first lord hurt him his body's a passable carcass if he be
 not hurt it is a thoroughfare for steel if it be not hurt
second lord aside his steel was in debt it went o the
 backside the town
cloten the villain would not stand me
second lord aside no but he fled forward still toward your face
first lord stand you you have land enough of your own but
 he added to your having gave you some ground
second lord aside as many inches as you have oceans puppies
cloten i would they had not come between us
second lord aside so would i till you had measured how long
 a fool you were upon the ground
cloten and that she should love this fellow and refuse me
second lord aside if it be a sin to make a true election she
 is damned
first lord sir as i told you always her beauty and her brain
 go not together she's a good sign but i have seen
 small reflection of her wit
second lord aside she shines not upon fools lest the
 reflection should hurt her
cloten come i'll to my chamber would there had been some
 hurt done

 of an ass which is no great hurt

scene iv rome philario's house
 enter philario iachimo a frenchman a
 dutchman and a spaniard
iachimo believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was
 then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy
 as since he hath been allowed the name of but i
 could then have looked on him without the help of
 admiration though the catalogue of his endowments
 had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items
philario you speak of him when he was less furnished than now
 he is with that which makes him both without and within
frenchman i have seen him in france we had very many there
 could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he
iachimo this matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein
 he must be weighed rather by her value than his own
 words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter
frenchman and then his banishment
iachimo ay and the approbation of those that weep this
 lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
 to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment
 which else an easy battery might lay flat for
 taking a beggar without less quality but how comes
 it he is to sojourn with you how creeps
 acquaintance
philario his father and i were soldiers together to whom i
 have been often bound for no less than my life
 here comes the briton let him be so entertained
 amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your
 knowing to a stranger of his quality
 enter posthumus leonatus
 i beseech you all be better known to this
 gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend
 of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear
 hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing
frenchman sir we have known together in orleans
posthumus leonatus since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies
 which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still
frenchman sir you o'errate my poor kindness i was glad i
 did atone my countryman and you it had been pity
 you should have been put together with so mortal a
 purpose as then each bore upon importance of so
 slight and trivial a nature
posthumus leonatus by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller
 rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in
 my every action to be guided by others experiences
 but upon my mended judgmentif i offend not to say
 it is mendedmy quarrel was not altogether slight
frenchman faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords
 and by such two that would by all likelihood have
 confounded one the other or have fallen both
iachimo can we with manners ask what was the difference
frenchman safely i think twas a contention in public
 which may without contradiction suffer the report
 it was much like an argument that fell out last
 night where each of us fell in praise of our
 country mistresses this gentleman at that time
 vouchingand upon warrant of bloody
 affirmationhis to be more fair virtuous wise
 chaste constantqualified and less attemptable
 than any the rarest of our ladies in france
iachimo that lady is not now living or this gentleman's
 opinion by this worn out
posthumus leonatus she holds her virtue still and i my mind
iachimo you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy
posthumus leonatus being so far provoked as i was in france i would
 abate her nothing though i profess myself her
 adorer not her friend
iachimo as fair and as gooda kind of handinhand
 comparisonhad been something too fair and too good
 for any lady in britain if she went before others
 i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres
 many i have beheld i could not but believe she
 excelled many but i have not seen the most
 precious diamond that is nor you the lady
posthumus leonatus i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone
iachimo what do you esteem it at
posthumus leonatus more than the world enjoys
iachimo either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she's
 outprized by a trifle
posthumus leonatus you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if
 there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit
 for the gift the other is not a thing for sale
 and only the gift of the gods
iachimo which the gods have given you
posthumus leonatus which by their graces i will keep
iachimo you may wear her in title yours but you know
 strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your
 ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable
 estimations the one is but frail and the other
 casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished
 courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last
posthumus leonatus your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
 to convince the honour of my mistress if in the
 holding or loss of that you term her frail i do
 nothing doubt you have store of thieves
 notwithstanding i fear not my ring
philario let us leave here gentlemen
posthumus leonatus sir with all my heart this worthy signior i
 thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first
iachimo with five times so much conversation i should get
 ground of your fair mistress make her go back even
 to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend
posthumus leonatus no no
iachimo i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
 your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it
 something but i make my wager rather against your
 confidence than her reputation and to bar your
 offence herein too i durst attempt it against any
 lady in the world
posthumus leonatus you are a great deal abused in too bold a
 persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what you're
 worthy of by your attempt
iachimo what's that
posthumus leonatus a repulse though your attempt as you call it
 deserve more a punishment too
philario gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly
 let it die as it was born and i pray you be
 better acquainted
iachimo would i had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
 approbation of what i have spoke
posthumus leonatus what lady would you choose to assail
iachimo yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe
 i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring
 that commend me to the court where your lady is
 with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
 second conference and i will bring from thence
 that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved
posthumus leonatus i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring
 i hold dear as my finger tis part of it
iachimo you are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy
 ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot
 preserve it from tainting but i see you have some
 religion in you that you fear
posthumus leonatus this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a
 graver purpose i hope
iachimo i am the master of my speeches and would undergo
 what's spoken i swear
posthumus leonatus will you i shall but lend my diamond till your
 return let there be covenants drawn between's my
 mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
 unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here's my ring
philario i will have it no lay
iachimo by the gods it is one if i bring you no
 sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest
 bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats
 are yours so is your diamond too if i come off
 and leave her in such honour as you have trust in
 she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are
 yours provided i have your commendation for my more
 free entertainment
posthumus leonatus i embrace these conditions let us have articles
 betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if
 you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
 to understand you have prevailed i am no further
 your enemy she is not worth our debate if she
 remain unseduced you not making it appear
 otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you
 have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
 your sword
iachimo your hand a covenant we will have these things set
 down by lawful counsel and straight away for
 britain lest the bargain should catch cold and
 starve i will fetch my gold and have our two
 wagers recorded
posthumus leonatus agreed

 make haste who has the note of them
first lady i madam
queen dispatch
 exeunt ladies
 now master doctor have you brought those drugs
cornelius pleaseth your highness ay here they are madam
 presenting a small box
 but i beseech your grace without offence
 my conscience bids me askwherefore you have
 commanded of me those most poisonous compounds
 which are the movers of a languishing death
 but though slow deadly
queen i wonder doctor
 thou ask'st me such a question have i not been
 thy pupil long hast thou not learn'd me how
 to make perfumes distil preserve yea so
 that our great king himself doth woo me oft
 for my confections having thus far proceeded
 unless thou think'st me devilishis't not meet
 that i did amplify my judgment in
 other conclusions i will try the forces
 of these thy compounds on such creatures as
 we count not worth the hanging but none human
 to try the vigour of them and apply
 allayments to their act and by them gather
 their several virtues and effects
cornelius your highness
 shall from this practise but make hard your heart
 besides the seeing these effects will be
 both noisome and infectious
queen o content thee
 enter pisanio
 aside
 here comes a flattering rascal upon him
 will i first work he's for his master
 an enemy to my son how now pisanio
 doctor your service for this time is ended
 take your own way
cornelius aside i do suspect you madam
 but you shall do no harm
queen to pisanio hark thee a word
cornelius aside i do not like her she doth think she has
 strange lingering poisons i do know her spirit
 and will not trust one of her malice with
 a drug of such damn'd nature those she has
 will stupefy and dull the sense awhile
 which first perchance she'll prove on
 cats and dogs
 then afterward up higher but there is
 no danger in what show of death it makes
 more than the lockingup the spirits a time
 to be more fresh reviving she is fool'd
 with a most false effect and i the truer
 so to be false with her
queen no further service doctor
 until i send for thee
cornelius i humbly take my leave
 exit
queen weeps she still say'st thou dost thou think in time
 she will not quench and let instructions enter
 where folly now possesses do thou work
 when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
 i'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
 as great as is thy master greater for
 his fortunes all lie speechless and his name
 is at last gasp return he cannot nor
 continue where he is to shift his being
 is to exchange one misery with another
 and every day that comes comes to decay
 a day's work in him what shalt thou expect
 to be depender on a thing that leans
 who cannot be new built nor has no friends
 so much as but to prop him
 the queen drops the box pisanio takes it up
 thou takest up
 thou know'st not what but take it for thy labour
 it is a thing i made which hath the king
 five times redeem'd from death i do not know
 what is more cordial nay i prethee take it
 it is an earnest of a further good
 that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how
 the case stands with her do't as from thyself
 think what a chance thou changest on but think
 thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
 who shall take notice of thee i'll move the king
 to any shape of thy preferment such
 as thou'lt desire and then myself i chiefly
 that set thee on to this desert am bound
 to load thy merit richly call my women
 think on my words
 exit pisanio
 a sly and constant knave
 not to be shaked the agent for his master
 and the remembrancer of her to hold

 except she bend her humour shall be assured
 to taste of too

 you're kindly welcome
iachimo aside all of her that is out of door most rich
 if she be furnish'd with a mind so rare
 she is alone the arabian bird and i
 have lost the wager boldness be my friend

imogen reads he is one of the noblest note to whose
 kindnesses i am most infinitely tied reflect upon
 him accordingly as you value your trust
 leonatus'
 so far i read aloud
 but even the very middle of my heart
 is warm'd by the rest and takes it thankfully
 you are as welcome worthy sir as i
 have words to bid you and shall find it so
 in all that i can do
iachimo thanks fairest lady
 what are men mad hath nature given them eyes
 to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
 of sea and land which can distinguish twixt
 the fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
 upon the number'd beach and can we not
 partition make with spectacles so precious
 twixt fair and foul
imogen what makes your admiration
iachimo it cannot be i the eye for apes and monkeys
 twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
 contemn with mows the other nor i the judgment
 for idiots in this case of favour would
 be wisely definite nor i the appetite
 sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
 should make desire vomit emptiness
 not so allured to feed
imogen what is the matter trow
iachimo the cloyed will
 that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub
 both fill'd and running ravening first the lamb
 longs after for the garbage

imogen is he disposed to mirth i hope he is
iachimo exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
 so merry and so gamesome he is call'd

imogen when he was here
 he did incline to sadness and ofttimes
 not knowing why
iachimo i never saw him sad
 there is a frenchman his companion one
 an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
 a gallian girl at home he furnaces
 the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton
 your lord i meanlaughs from's free lungs cries o
 can my sides hold to think that man who knows
 by history report or his own proof
 what woman is yea what she cannot choose
 but must be will his free hours languish for
 assured bondage'
imogen will my lord say so
iachimo ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
 it is a recreation to be by
 and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know
 some men are much to blame
imogen not he i hope
iachimo not he but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
 be used more thankfully in himself tis much
 in you which i account his beyond all talents
 whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound
 to pity too
imogen what do you pity sir
iachimo two creatures heartily
imogen am i one sir
 you look on me what wreck discern you in me
 deserves your pity
iachimo lamentable what
 to hide me from the radiant sun and solace
 i the dungeon by a snuff
imogen i pray you sir
 deliver with more openness your answers
 to my demands why do you pity me
iachimo that others do
 i was about to sayenjoy yourbut
 it is an office of the gods to venge it
 not mine to speak on t
imogen you do seem to know
 something of me or what concerns me pray you
 since doubling things go ill often hurts more
 than to be sure they do for certainties
 either are past remedies or timely knowing
 the remedy then borndiscover to me
 what both you spur and stop
iachimo had i this cheek
 to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
 whose every touch would force the feeler's soul
 to the oath of loyalty this object which
 takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
 fixing it only here should i damn'd then
 slaver with lips as common as the stairs
 that mount the capitol join gripes with hands
 made hard with hourly falsehoodfalsehood as
 with labour then bypeeping in an eye
 base and unlustrous as the smoky light
 that's fed with stinking tallow it were fit
 that all the plagues of hell should at one time
 encounter such revolt
imogen my lord i fear
 has forgot britain
iachimo and himself not i
 inclined to this intelligence pronounce
 the beggary of his change but tis your graces
 that from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
 charms this report out
imogen let me hear no more
iachimo o dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
 with pity that doth make me sick a lady
 so fair and fasten'd to an empery
 would make the great'st king doubleto be partner'd
 with tomboys hired with that selfexhibition
 which your own coffers yield with diseased ventures
 that play with all infirmities for gold
 which rottenness can lend nature such boil'd stuff
 as well might poison poison be revenged
 or she that bore you was no queen and you
 recoil from your great stock
imogen revenged
 how should i be revenged if this be true
 as i have such a heart that both mine ears
 must not in haste abuseif it be true
 how should i be revenged
iachimo should he make me
 live like diana's priest betwixt cold sheets
 whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
 in your despite upon your purse revenge it
 i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
 more noble than that runagate to your bed
 and will continue fast to your affection
 still close as sure
imogen what ho pisanio
iachimo let me my service tender on your lips
imogen away i do condemn mine ears that have
 so long attended thee if thou wert honourable
 thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
 for such an end thou seek'stas base as strange
 thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
 from thy report as thou from honour and
 solicit'st here a lady that disdains
 thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio
 the king my father shall be made acquainted
 of thy assault if he shall think it fit
 a saucy stranger in his court to mart
 as in a romish stew and to expound
 his beastly mind to us he hath a court
 he little cares for and a daughter who
 he not respects at all what ho pisanio
iachimo o happy leonatus i may say
 the credit that thy lady hath of thee
 deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
 her assured credit blessed live you long
 a lady to the worthiest sir that ever
 country call'd his and you his mistress only
 for the most worthiest fit give me your pardon
 i have spoke this to know if your affiance
 were deeply rooted and shall make your lord

 the truest manner'd such a holy witch
 that he enchants societies into him
 half all men's hearts are his

iachimo he sits mongst men like a descended god
 he hath a kind of honour sets him off
 more than a mortal seeming be not angry
 most mighty princess that i have adventured
 to try your taking a false report which hath
 honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
 in the election of a sir so rare
 which you know cannot err the love i bear him
 made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
 unlike all others chaffless pray your pardon

 issues being foolish do not derogate
cloten come i'll go see this italian what i have lost
 today at bowls i'll win tonight of him come go
second lord i'll attend your lordship
 exeunt cloten and first lord
 that such a crafty devil as is his mother
 should yield the world this ass a woman that
 bears all down with her brain and this her son
 cannot take two from twenty for his heart
 and leave eighteen alas poor princess
 thou divine imogen what thou endurest
 betwixt a father by thy stepdame govern'd
 a mother hourly coining plots a wooer
 more hateful than the foul expulsion is
 of thy dear husband than that horrid act
 of the divorce he'ld make the heavens hold firm
 the walls of thy dear honour keep unshaked
 that temple thy fair mind that thou mayst stand
 to enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land

 a trunk in one corner of it
 imogen in bed reading a lady attending
imogen who's there my woman helen
lady please you madam
imogen what hour is it
lady almost midnight madam
imogen i have read three hours then mine eyes are weak
 fold down the leaf where i have left to bed
 take not away the taper leave it burning
 and if thou canst awake by four o the clock
 i prithee call me sleep hath seized me wholly
 exit lady
 to your protection i commend me gods
 from fairies and the tempters of the night
 guard me beseech ye
 sleeps iachimo comes from the trunk
iachimo the crickets sing and man's o'erlabour'd sense
 repairs itself by rest our tarquin thus
 did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd
 the chastity he wounded cytherea
 how bravely thou becomest thy bed fresh lily
 and whiter than the sheets that i might touch
 but kiss one kiss rubies unparagon'd
 how dearly they do't tis her breathing that
 perfumes the chamber thus the flame o the taper
 bows toward her and would underpeep her lids
 to see the enclosed lights now canopied
 under these windows white and azure laced
 with blue of heaven's own tinct but my design
 to note the chamber i will write all down
 such and such pictures there the window such
 the adornment of her bed the arras figures
 why such and such and the contents o the story
 ah but some natural notes about her body
 above ten thousand meaner moveables
 would testify to enrich mine inventory
 o sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her
 and be her sense but as a monument
 thus in a chapel lying come off come off
 taking off her bracelet
 as slippery as the gordian knot was hard
 tis mine and this will witness outwardly
 as strongly as the conscience does within
 to the madding of her lord on her left breast
 a mole cinquespotted like the crimson drops
 i the bottom of a cowslip here's a voucher
 stronger than ever law could make this secret
 will force him think i have pick'd the lock and ta'en
 the treasure of her honour no more to what end
 why should i write this down that's riveted
 screw'd to my memory she hath been reading late
 the tale of tereus here the leaf's turn'd down
 where philomel gave up i have enough
 to the trunk again and shut the spring of it
 swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning
 may bare the raven's eye i lodge in fear
 though this a heavenly angel hell is here
 clock strikes
 one two three time time

 on whom there is no more dependency
 but brats and beggary in selffigured knot

 the consequence o the crown and must not soil
 the precious note of it with a base slave
 a hilding for a livery a squire's cloth
 a pantler not so eminent
imogen profane fellow
 wert thou the son of jupiter and no more

posthumus leonatus fear it not sir i would i were so sure
 to win the king as i am bold her honour
 will remain hers
philario what means do you make to him
posthumus leonatus not any but abide the change of time
 quake in the present winter's state and wish
 that warmer days would come in these sear'd hopes
 i barely gratify your love they failing
 i must die much your debtor
philario your very goodness and your company
 o'erpays all i can do by this your king
 hath heard of great augustus caius lucius
 will do's commission throughly and i think
 he'll grant the tribute send the arrearages
 or look upon our romans whose remembrance
 is yet fresh in their grief
posthumus leonatus i do believe
 statist though i am none nor like to be
 that this will prove a war and you shall hear
 the legions now in gallia sooner landed
 in our notfearing britain than have tidings
 of any penny tribute paid our countrymen
 are men more order'd than when julius caesar
 smiled at their lack of skill but found
 their courage
 worthy his frowning at their discipline
 now mingled with their courages will make known
 to their approvers they are people such
 that mend upon the world
 enter iachimo
philario see iachimo
posthumus leonatus the swiftest harts have posted you by land
 and winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails
 to make your vessel nimble
philario welcome sir
posthumus leonatus i hope the briefness of your answer made
 the speediness of your return
iachimo your lady
 is one of the fairest that i have look'd upon
posthumus leonatus and therewithal the best or let her beauty
 look through a casement to allure false hearts
 and be false with them
iachimo here are letters for you
posthumus leonatus their tenor good i trust
iachimo tis very like
philario was caius lucius in the britain court
 when you were there
iachimo he was expected then
 but not approach'd
posthumus leonatus all is well yet
 sparkles this stone as it was wont or is't not
 too dull for your good wearing
iachimo if i had lost it
 i should have lost the worth of it in gold
 i'll make a journey twice as far to enjoy
 a second night of such sweet shortness which
 was mine in britain for the ring is won
posthumus leonatus the stone's too hard to come by
iachimo not a whit
 your lady being so easy
posthumus leonatus make not sir
 your loss your sport i hope you know that we
 must not continue friends
iachimo good sir we must
 if you keep covenant had i not brought
 the knowledge of your mistress home i grant
 we were to question further but i now
 profess myself the winner of her honour
 together with your ring and not the wronger
 of her or you having proceeded but
 by both your wills
posthumus leonatus if you can make't apparent
 that you have tasted her in bed my hand
 and ring is yours if not the foul opinion
 you had of her pure honour gains or loses
 your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
 to who shall find them
iachimo sir my circumstances
 being so near the truth as i will make them
 must first induce you to believe whose strength
 i will confirm with oath which i doubt not
 you'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
 you need it not
posthumus leonatus proceed
iachimo first her bedchamber
 where i confess i slept not but profess
 had that was well worth watchingit was hang'd
 with tapesty of silk and silver the story
 proud cleopatra when she met her roman
 and cydnus swell'd above the banks or for
 the press of boats or pride a piece of work
 so bravely done so rich that it did strive
 in workmanship and value which i wonder'd
 could be so rarely and exactly wrought
 since the true life on't was
posthumus leonatus this is true
 and this you might have heard of here by me
 or by some other
iachimo more particulars
 must justify my knowledge
posthumus leonatus so they must
 or do your honour injury
iachimo the chimney
 is south the chamber and the chimneypiece
 chaste dian bathing never saw i figures
 so likely to report themselves the cutter
 was as another nature dumb outwent her
 motion and breath left out
posthumus leonatus this is a thing
 which you might from relation likewise reap
 being as it is much spoke of
iachimo the roof o the chamber
 with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons
 i had forgot themwere two winking cupids
 of silver each on one foot standing nicely
 depending on their brands
posthumus leonatus this is her honour
 let it be granted you have seen all thisand praise
 be given to your remembrancethe description
 of what is in her chamber nothing saves
 the wager you have laid
iachimo then if you can
 showing the bracelet
 be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel see
 and now tis up again it must be married
 to that your diamond i'll keep them
posthumus leonatus jove
 once more let me behold it is it that
 which i left with her
iachimo siri thank herthat
 she stripp'd it from her arm i see her yet
 her pretty action did outsell her gift
 and yet enrich'd it too she gave it me and said
 she prized it once
posthumus leonatus may be she pluck'd it off
 to send it me
iachimo she writes so to you doth she
posthumus leonatus o no no no tis true here take this too
 gives the ring
 it is a basilisk unto mine eye
 kills me to look on't let there be no honour
 where there is beauty truth where semblance love
 where there's another man the vows of women
 of no more bondage be to where they are made
 than they are to their virtues which is nothing
 o above measure false
philario have patience sir
 and take your ring again tis not yet won
 it may be probable she lost it or
 who knows if one of her women being corrupted
 hath stol'n it from her
posthumus leonatus very true
 and so i hope he came by't back my ring
 render to me some corporal sign about her
 more evident than this for this was stolen
iachimo by jupiter i had it from her arm
posthumus leonatus hark you he swears by jupiter he swears
 tis truenay keep the ring'tis true i am sure
 she would not lose it her attendants are
 all sworn and honourablethey induced to steal it
 and by a strangerno he hath enjoyed her
 the cognizance of her incontinency
 is this she hath bought the name of whore
 thus dearly
 there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
 divide themselves between you
philario sir be patient
 this is not strong enough to be believed
 of one persuaded well of
posthumus leonatus never talk on't
 she hath been colted by him
iachimo if you seek
 for further satisfying under her breast
 worthy the pressinglies a mole right proud
 of that most delicate lodging by my life
 i kiss'd it and it gave me present hunger
 to feed again though full you do remember
 this stain upon her
posthumus leonatus ay and it doth confirm
 another stain as big as hell can hold
 were there no more but it
iachimo will you hear more
posthumus leonatus spare your arithmetic never count the turns
 once and a million
iachimo i'll be sworn
posthumus leonatus no swearing
 if you will swear you have not done't you lie
 and i will kill thee if thou dost deny
 thou'st made me cuckold
iachimo i'll deny nothing
posthumus leonatus o that i had her here to tear her limbmeal
 i will go there and do't i the court before
 her father i'll do something

 the government of patience you have won

 he hath against himself

posthumus leonatus is there no way for men to be but women

 as chaste as unsunn'd snow o all the devils

 like a fullacorn'd boar a german one
 cried o and mounted found no opposition
 but what he look'd for should oppose and she
 should from encounter guard could i find out
 the woman's part in me for there's no motion
 that tends to vice in man but i affirm
 it is the woman's part be it lying note it
 the woman's flattering hers deceiving hers
 lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
 ambitions covetings change of prides disdain
 nice longing slanders mutability
 all faults that may be named nay that hell knows
 why hers in part or all but rather all
 for even to vice
 they are not constant but are changing still
 one vice but of a minute old for one
 not half so old as that i'll write against them
 detest them curse them yet tis greater skill
 in a true hate to pray they have their will

scene i britain a hall in cymbeline's palace
 enter in state cymbeline queen cloten
 and lords at one door and at another
 caius lucius and attendants
cymbeline now say what would augustus caesar with us
caius lucius when julius caesar whose remembrance yet
 lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
 be theme and hearing ever was in this britain
 and conquer'd it cassibelan thine uncle
 famous in caesar's praises no whit less
 than in his feats deserving itfor him
 and his succession granted rome a tribute
 yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
 is left untender'd
queen and to kill the marvel
 shall be so ever
cloten there be many caesars
 ere such another julius britain is
 a world by itself and we will nothing pay
 for wearing our own noses
queen that opportunity
 which then they had to take from s to resume
 we have again remember sir my liege
 the kings your ancestors together with
 the natural bravery of your isle which stands
 as neptune's park ribbed and paled in
 with rocks unscalable and roaring waters
 with sands that will not bear your enemies boats
 but suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquest
 caesar made here but made not here his brag
 of came and saw and overcame  with shame
 that first that ever touch'd himhe was carried
 from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping
 poor ignorant baubles upon our terrible seas
 like eggshells moved upon their surges crack'd
 as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof
 the famed cassibelan who was once at point
 o giglot fortuneto master caesar's sword
 made lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
 and britons strut with courage
cloten come there's no more tribute to be paid our
 kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and
 as i said there is no moe such caesars other of
 them may have crook'd noses but to owe such
 straight arms none
cymbeline son let your mother end
cloten we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
 cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a
 hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if
 caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or
 put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute
 for light else sir no more tribute pray you now
cymbeline you must know
 till the injurious romans did extort
 this tribute from us we were free
 caesar's ambition
 which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
 the sides o the world against all colour here
 did put the yoke upon s which to shake off
 becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
 ourselves to be
cloten 
 we do
lords 
cymbeline say then to caesar
 our ancestor was that mulmutius which
 ordain'd our laws whose use the sword of caesar
 hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
 shall by the power we hold be our good deed
 though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws
 who was the first of britain which did put
 his brows within a golden crown and call'd
 himself a king
caius lucius i am sorry cymbeline
 that i am to pronounce augustus caesar
 caesar that hath more kings his servants than
 thyself domestic officersthine enemy
 receive it from me then war and confusion
 in caesar's name pronounce i gainst thee look
 for fury not to be resisted thus defied
 i thank thee for myself
cymbeline thou art welcome caius
 thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent
 much under him of him i gather'd honour
 which he to seek of me again perforce
 behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect
 that the pannonians and dalmatians for
 their liberties are now in arms a precedent
 which not to read would show the britons cold
 so caesar shall not find them
caius lucius let proof speak
cloten his majesty bids you welcome make
 pastime with us a day or two or longer if
 you seek us afterwards in other terms you
 shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you
 beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in
 the adventure our crows shall fare the better
 for you and there's an end

belarius now for our mountain sport up to yond hill
 your legs are young i'll tread these flats consider

 that it is place which lessens and sets off
 and you may then revolve what tales i have told you
 of courts of princes of the tricks in war
 this service is not service so being done

 have never wing'd from view o the nest nor know not
 what air's from home haply this life is best
 if quiet life be best sweeter to you
 that have a sharper known well corresponding
 with your stiff age but unto us it is
 a cell of ignorance travelling abed
 a prison for a debtor that not dares

arviragus what should we speak of
 when we are old as you when we shall hear
 the rain and wind beat dark december how
 in this our pinching cave shall we discourse
 the freezing hours away we have seen nothing
 we are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
 like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
 our valour is to chase what flies our cage
 we make a quire as doth the prison'd bird
 and sing our bondage freely
belarius how you speak
 did you but know the city's usuries
 and felt them knowingly the art o the court
 as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
 is certain falling or so slippery that
 the fear's as bad as falling the toil o the war
 a pain that only seems to seek out danger
 i the name of fame and honour which dies i'
 the search

 as record of fair act nay many times
 doth ill deserve by doing well what's worse

 whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
 a storm or robbery call it what you will
 shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
 and left me bare to weather
guiderius uncertain favour
belarius my fault being nothingas i have told you oft
 but that two villains whose false oaths prevail'd
 before my perfect honour swore to cymbeline
 i was confederate with the romans so
 follow'd my banishment and this twenty years
 this rock and these demesnes have been my world
 where i have lived at honest freedom paid
 more pious debts to heaven than in all
 the foreend of my time but up to the mountains
 this is not hunters language he that strikes
 the venison first shall be the lord o the feast
 to him the other two shall minister
 and we will fear no poison which attends
 in place of greater state i'll meet you in the valleys
 exeunt guiderius and arviragus
 how hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
 these boys know little they are sons to the king
 nor cymbeline dreams that they are alive
 they think they are mine and though train'd
 up thus meanly
 i the cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit
 the roofs of palaces and nature prompts them
 in simple and low things to prince it much
 beyond the trick of others this polydore
 the heir of cymbeline and britain who
 the king his father call'd guideriusjove
 when on my threefoot stool i sit and tell
 the warlike feats i have done his spirits fly out
 into my story say thus mine enemy fell
 and thus i set my foot on s neck even then
 the princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats
 strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
 that acts my words the younger brother cadwal
 once arviragus in as like a figure
 strikes life into my speech and shows much more
 his own conceivinghark the game is roused
 o cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows
 thou didst unjustly banish me whereon
 at three and two years old i stole these babes
 thinking to bar thee of succession as
 thou reft'st me of my lands euriphile
 thou wast their nurse they took thee for
 their mother
 and every day do honour to her grave
 myself belarius that am morgan call'd
 they take for natural father the game is up

scene iv country near milfordhaven
 enter pisanio and imogen
imogen thou told'st me when we came from horse the place
 was near at hand ne'er long'd my mother so
 to see me first as i have now pisanio man
 where is posthumus what is in thy mind
 that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh
 from the inward of thee one but painted thus
 would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
 beyond selfexplication put thyself
 into a havior of less fear ere wildness
 vanquish my staider senses what's the matter
 why tender'st thou that paper to me with
 a look untender if't be summer news
 smile to't before if winterly thou need'st
 but keep that countenance still my husband's hand
 that drugdamn'd italy hath outcraftied him
 and he's at some hard point speak man thy tongue
 may take off some extremity which to read
 would be even mortal to me
pisanio please you read
 and you shall find me wretched man a thing
 the most disdain'd of fortune
imogen reads thy mistress pisanio hath played the
 strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie
 bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises
 but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
 as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio
 must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with
 the breach of hers let thine own hands take away
 her life i shall give thee opportunity at
 milfordhaven she hath my letter for the purpose
 where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
 it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
 equally to me disloyal'
pisanio what shall i need to draw my sword the paper
 hath cut her throat already no tis slander
 whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
 outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath
 rides on the posting winds and doth belie
 all corners of the world kings queens and states
 maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
 this viperous slander enters what cheer madam
imogen false to his bed what is it to be false
 to lie in watch there and to think on him
 to weep twixt clock and clock if sleep
 charge nature
 to break it with a fearful dream of him
 and cry myself awake that's false to's bed is it
pisanio alas good lady
imogen i false thy conscience witness iachimo
 thou didst accuse him of incontinency
 thou then look'dst like a villain now methinks
 thy favour's good enough some jay of italy
 whose mother was her painting hath betray'd him
 poor i am stale a garment out of fashion
 and for i am richer than to hang by the walls
 i must be ripp'dto pieces with meo
 men's vows are women's traitors all good seeming
 by thy revolt o husband shall be thought
 put on for villany not born where't grows
 but worn a bait for ladies
pisanio good madam hear me
imogen true honest men being heard like false aeneas
 were in his time thought false and sinon's weeping
 did scandal many a holy tear took pity
 from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus
 wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
 goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
 from thy great fall come fellow be thou honest
 do thou thy master's bidding when thou see'st him
 a little witness my obedience look
 i draw the sword myself take it and hit
 the innocent mansion of my love my heart
 fear not tis empty of all things but grief
 thy master is not there who was indeed
 the riches of it do his bidding strike
 thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
 but now thou seem'st a coward
pisanio hence vile instrument
 thou shalt not damn my hand
imogen why i must die
 and if i do not by thy hand thou art
 no servant of thy master's against selfslaughter
 there is a prohibition so divine
 that cravens my weak hand come here's my heart
 something's afore't soft soft we'll no defence
 obedient as the scabbard what is here
 the scriptures of the loyal leonatus
 all turn'd to heresy away away
 corrupters of my faith you shall no more
 be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools
 believe false teachers though those that
 are betray'd
 do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
 stands in worse case of woe
 and thou posthumus thou that didst set up
 my disobedience gainst the king my father
 and make me put into contempt the suits
 of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
 it is no act of common passage but
 a strain of rareness and i grieve myself
 to think when thou shalt be disedged by her
 that now thou tirest on how thy memory
 will then be pang'd by me prithee dispatch
 the lamb entreats the butcher where's thy knife
 thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding
 when i desire it too
pisanio o gracious lady
 since i received command to do this business
 i have not slept one wink
imogen do't and to bed then
pisanio i'll wake mine eyeballs blind first
imogen wherefore then
 didst undertake it why hast thou abused
 so many miles with a pretence this place
 mine action and thine own our horses labour
 the time inviting thee the perturb'd court
 for my being absent whereunto i never
 purpose return why hast thou gone so far
 to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand
 the elected deer before thee
pisanio but to win time
 to lose so bad employment in the which
 i have consider'd of a course good lady
 hear me with patience
imogen talk thy tongue weary speak
 i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear
 therein false struck can take no greater wound
 nor tent to bottom that but speak
pisanio then madam
 i thought you would not back again
imogen most like
 bringing me here to kill me
pisanio not so neither
 but if i were as wise as honest then
 my purpose would prove well it cannot be
 but that my master is abused
 some villain ay and singular in his art
 hath done you both this cursed injury
imogen some roman courtezan
pisanio no on my life
 i'll give but notice you are dead and send him
 some bloody sign of it for tis commanded
 i should do so you shall be miss'd at court
 and that will well confirm it
imogen why good fellow
 what shall i do the where where bide how live
 or in my life what comfort when i am
 dead to my husband
pisanio if you'll back to the court
imogen no court no father nor no more ado
 with that harsh noble simple nothing
 that cloten whose lovesuit hath been to me
 as fearful as a siege
pisanio if not at court
 then not in britain must you bide
imogen where then
 hath britain all the sun that shines day night
 are they not but in britain i the world's volume
 our britain seems as of it but not in t
 in a great pool a swan's nest prithee think
 there's livers out of britain
pisanio i am most glad
 you think of other place the ambassador
 lucius the roman comes to milfordhaven
 tomorrow now if you could wear a mind
 dark as your fortune is and but disguise
 that which to appear itself must not yet be
 but by selfdanger you should tread a course
 pretty and full of view yea haply near
 the residence of posthumus so nigh at least
 that though his actions were not visible yet
 report should render him hourly to your ear
 as truly as he moves
imogen o for such means
 though peril to my modesty not death on't
 i would adventure
pisanio well then here's the point
 you must forget to be a woman change
 command into obedience fear and niceness
 the handmaids of all women or more truly
 woman its pretty selfinto a waggish courage
 ready in gibes quickanswer'd saucy and
 as quarrelous as the weasel nay you must
 forget that rarest treasure of your cheek
 exposing itbut o the harder heart
 alack no remedyto the greedy touch
 of commonkissing titan and forget
 your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
 you made great juno angry
imogen nay be brief
 i see into thy end and am almost
 a man already
pisanio first make yourself but like one
 forethinking this i have already fit
 tis in my cloakbagdoublet hat hose all
 that answer to them would you in their serving
 and with what imitation you can borrow
 from youth of such a season fore noble lucius
 present yourself desire his service tell him
 wherein you're happywhich you'll make him know
 if that his head have ear in musicdoubtless
 with joy he will embrace you for he's honourable
 and doubling that most holy your means abroad
 you have me rich and i will never fail
 beginning nor supplyment
imogen thou art all the comfort
 the gods will diet me with prithee away
 there's more to be consider'd but we'll even
 all that good time will give us this attempt
 i am soldier to and will abide it with
 a prince's courage away i prithee
pisanio well madam we must take a short farewell
 lest being miss'd i be suspected of
 your carriage from the court my noble mistress
 here is a box i had it from the queen
 what's in't is precious if you are sick at sea
 or stomachqualm'd at land a dram of this
 will drive away distemper to some shade
 and fit you to your manhood may the gods
 direct you to the best

 his war for britain
queen tis not sleepy business

cymbeline our expectation that it would be thus
 hath made us forward but my gentle queen
 where is our daughter she hath not appear'd
 before the roman nor to us hath tender'd
 the duty of the day she looks us like
 a thing more made of malice than of duty
 we have noted it call her before us for
 we have been too slight in sufferance
 exit an attendant
queen royal sir

 whereto constrain'd by her infirmity
 she should that duty leave unpaid to you

 and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
 than lady ladies woman from every one
 the best she hath and she of all compounded
 outsells them all i love her therefore but
 disdaining me and throwing favours on
 the low posthumus slanders so her judgment
 that what's else rare is choked and in that point
 i will conclude to hate her nay indeed
 to be revenged upon her for when fools shall
 enter pisanio

 come hither ah you precious pander villain
 where is thy lady in a word or else
 thou art straightway with the fiends
pisanio o good my lord

 cause to use thee with a serious industry that is
 what villany soe'er i bid thee do to perform it

 man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
 relief nor my voice for thy preferment

 held the very garment of posthumus in more respect
 than my noble and natural person together with the
 adornment of my qualities with that suit upon my
 back will i ravish her first kill him and in her
 eyes there shall she see my valour which will then
 be a torment to her contempt he on the ground my
 speech of insultment ended on his dead body and
 when my lust hath dinedwhich as i say to vex
 her i will execute in the clothes that she so
 praisedto the court i'll knock her back foot

 and i'll be merry in my revenge

 when i have slain thee with my proper hand
 i'll follow those that even now fled hence
 and on the gates of lud'stown set your heads
 yield rustic mountaineer
 exeunt fighting
 reenter belarius and arviragus
belarius no companies abroad
arviragus none in the world you did mistake him sure
belarius i cannot tell long is it since i saw him
 but time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
 which then he wore the snatches in his voice
 and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute
 twas very cloten
arviragus in this place we left them
 i wish my brother make good time with him
 you say he is so fell
belarius being scarce made up
 i mean to man he had not apprehension
 of roaring terrors for the effect of judgment
 is oft the cause of fear but see thy brother
 reenter guiderius with cloten's head
guiderius this cloten was a fool an empty purse
 there was no money in't not hercules
 could have knock'd out his brains for he had none
 yet i not doing this the fool had borne
 my head as i do his
belarius what hast thou done
guiderius i am perfect what cut off one cloten's head
 son to the queen after his own report
 who call'd me traitor mountaineer and swore
 with his own single hand he'ld take us in
 displace our heads wherethank the godsthey grow
 and set them on lud'stown
belarius we are all undone
guiderius why worthy father what have we to lose
 but that he swore to take our lives the law
 protects not us then why should we be tender
 to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
 play judge and executioner all himself
 for we do fear the law what company
 discover you abroad
belarius no single soul
 can we set eye on but in all safe reason
 he must have some attendants though his humour
 was nothing but mutation ay and that
 from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not
 absolute madness could so far have raved
 to bring him here alone although perhaps
 it may be heard at court that such as we
 cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
 may make some stronger head the which he hearing
 as it is like himmight break out and swear
 he'ld fetch us in yet is't not probable
 to come alone either he so undertaking
 or they so suffering then on good ground we fear
 if we do fear this body hath a tail
 more perilous than the head
arviragus let ordinance
 come as the gods foresay it howsoe'er
 my brother hath done well
belarius i had no mind
 to hunt this day the boy fidele's sickness
 did make my way long forth
guiderius with his own sword
 which he did wave against my throat i have ta'en
 his head from him i'll throw't into the creek
 behind our rock and let it to the sea
 and tell the fishes he's the queen's son cloten
 that's all i reck
 exit
belarius i fear twill be revenged
 would polydote thou hadst not done't though valour
 becomes thee well enough
arviragus would i had done't
 so the revenge alone pursued me polydore
 i love thee brotherly but envy much
 thou hast robb'd me of this deed i would revenges
 that possible strength might meet would seek us through
 and put us to our answer
belarius well tis done
 we'll hunt no more today nor seek for danger
 where there's no profit i prithee to our rock
 you and fidele play the cooks i'll stay
 till hasty polydote return and bring him
 to dinner presently
arviragus poor sick fidele
 i'll weringly to him to gain his colour
 i'ld let a parish of such clotens blood
 and praise myself for charity
 exit
belarius o thou goddess
 thou divine nature how thyself thou blazon'st
 in these two princely boys they are as gentle
 as zephyrs blowing below the violet
 not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
 their royal blood enchafed as the rudest wind
 that by the top doth take the mountain pine
 and make him stoop to the vale tis wonder
 that an invisible instinct should frame them
 to royalty unlearn'd honour untaught
 civility not seen from other valour
 that wildly grows in them but yields a crop
 as if it had been sow'd yet still it's strange
 what cloten's being here to us portends
 or what his death will bring us
 reenter guiderius
guiderius where's my brother
 i have sent cloten's clotpoll down the stream
 in embassy to his mother his body's hostage
 for his return
 solemn music
belarius my ingenious instrument
 hark polydore it sounds but what occasion
 hath cadwal now to give it motion hark
guiderius is he at home
belarius he went hence even now
guiderius what does he mean since death of my dear'st mother
 it did not speak before all solemn things
 should answer solemn accidents the matter
 triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
 is jollity for apes and grief for boys
 is cadwal mad
belarius look here he comes
 and brings the dire occasion in his arms
 of what we blame him for
 reenter arviragus with imogen as dead
 bearing her in his arms
arviragus the bird is dead
 that we have made so much on i had rather
 have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty
 to have turn'd my leapingtime into a crutch
 than have seen this
guiderius o sweetest fairest lily
 my brother wears thee not the one half so well
 as when thou grew'st thyself
belarius o melancholy
 who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
 the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
 might easiliest harbour in thou blessed thing
 jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i
 thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
 how found you him
arviragus stark as you see
 thus smiling as some fly hid tickled slumber
 not as death's dart being laugh'd at his
 right cheek
 reposing on a cushion
guiderius where
arviragus o the floor
 his arms thus leagued i thought he slept and put
 my clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
 answer'd my steps too loud
guiderius why he but sleeps
 if he be gone he'll make his grave a bed
 with female fairies will his tomb be haunted
 and worms will not come to thee
arviragus with fairest flowers
 whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele
 i'll sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
 the flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor
 the azured harebell like thy veins no nor
 the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
 outsweeten'd not thy breath the ruddock would
 with charitable billo bill soreshaming
 those richleft heirs that let their fathers lie
 without a monumentbring thee all this
 yea and furr'd moss besides when flowers are none
 to winterground thy corse
guiderius prithee have done
 and do not play in wenchlike words with that
 which is so serious let us bury him
 and not protract with admiration what
 is now due debt to the grave
arviragus say where shall's lay him
guiderius by good euriphile our mother
arviragus be't so
 and let us polydore though now our voices
 have got the mannish crack sing him to the ground
 as once our mother use like note and words
 save that euriphile must be fidele
guiderius cadwal
 i cannot sing i'll weep and word it with thee
 for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
 than priests and fanes that lie
arviragus we'll speak it then
belarius great griefs i see medicine the less for cloten
 is quite forgot he was a queen's son boys
 and though he came our enemy remember
 he was paid for that though mean and
 mighty rotting
 together have one dust yet reverence
 that angel of the world doth make distinction
 of place tween high and low our foe was princely
 and though you took his life as being our foe
 yet bury him as a prince
guiderius pray you fetch him hither
 thersites body is as good as ajax'
 when neither are alive
arviragus if you'll go fetch him
 we'll say our song the whilst brother begin
 exit belarius
guiderius nay cadwal we must lay his head to the east
 my father hath a reason for't
arviragus tis true
guiderius come on then and remove him
arviragus so begin
 song
guiderius fear no more the heat o the sun
 nor the furious winter's rages
 thou thy worldly task hast done
 home art gone and ta'en thy wages
 golden lads and girls all must
 as chimneysweepers come to dust
arviragus fear no more the frown o the great
 thou art past the tyrant's stroke
 care no more to clothe and eat
 to thee the reed is as the oak
 the sceptre learning physic must
 all follow this and come to dust
guiderius fear no more the lightning flash
arviragus nor the alldreaded thunderstone
guiderius fear not slander censure rash
arviragus thou hast finish'd joy and moan
guiderius 
 all lovers young all lovers must
arviragus consign to thee and come to dust
guiderius no exorciser harm thee
arviragus nor no witchcraft charm thee

 which we have done whose answer would be death
 drawn on with torture
guiderius this is sir a doubt
 in such a time nothing becoming you
 nor satisfying us
arviragus it is not likely
 that when they hear the roman horses neigh
 behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes
 and ears so cloy'd importantly as now
 that they will waste their time upon our note
 to know from whence we are
belarius o i am known
 of many in the army many years
 though cloten then but young you see not wore him
 from my remembrance and besides the king
 hath not deserved my service nor your loves
 who find in my exile the want of breeding
 the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
 to have the courtesy your cradle promised
 but to be still hot summer's tamings and
 the shrinking slaves of winter
guiderius than be so
 better to cease to be pray sir to the army
 i and my brother are not known yourself
 so out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown

arviragus by this sun that shines
 i'll thither what thing is it that i never
 did see man die scarce ever look'd on blood
 but that of coward hares hot goats and venison
 never bestrid a horse save one that had
 a rider like myself who ne'er wore rowel
 nor iron on his heel i am ashamed
 to look upon the holy sun to have
 the benefit of his blest beams remaining
 so long a poor unknown
guiderius by heavens i'll go
 if you will bless me sir and give me leave
 i'll take the better care but if you will not
 the hazard therefore due fall on me by
 the hands of romans

 so slight a valuation should reserve

 of his wings destitute the army broken

 through a straight lane the enemy fullhearted
 lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work
 more plentiful than tools to do't struck down
 some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling
 merely through fear that the straight pass was damm'd
 with dead men hurt behind and cowards living
 to die with lengthen'd shame

 which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
 an honest one i warrant who deserved
 so long a breeding as his white beard came to

 slight thing of italy

 our fealty and tenantius right
 with honour to maintain
first brother like hardiment posthumus hath
 to cymbeline perform'd
 then jupiter thou king of gods
 why hast thou thus adjourn'd
 the graces for his merits due
 being all to dolours turn'd
sicilius leonatus thy crystal window ope look out
 no longer exercise
 upon a valiant race thy harsh
 and potent injuries
mother since jupiter our son is good
 take off his miseries
sicilius leonatus peep through thy marble mansion help
 or we poor ghosts will cry
 to the shining synod of the rest
 against thy deity
first brother help jupiter or we appeal
 and from thy justice fly
second brother 
 jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting
 upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt the
 apparitions fall on their knees
jupiter no more you petty spirits of region low
 offend our hearing hush how dare you ghosts
 accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know
 skyplanted batters all rebelling coasts
 poor shadows of elysium hence and rest
 upon your neverwithering banks of flowers
 be not with mortal accidents opprest
 no care of yours it is you know tis ours
 whom best i love i cross to make my gift
 the more delay'd delighted be content
 your lowlaid son our godhead will uplift
 his comforts thrive his trials well are spent
 our jovial star reign'd at his birth and in
 our temple was he married rise and fade
 he shall be lord of lady imogen
 and happier much by his affliction made
 this tablet lay upon his breast wherein
 our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
 and so away no further with your din
 express impatience lest you stir up mine
 mount eagle to my palace crystalline
 ascends
sicilius leonatus he came in thunder his celestial breath
 was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle
 stoop'd as to foot us his ascension is
 more sweet than our blest fields his royal bird
 prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
 as when his god is pleased
all thanks jupiter
sicilius leonatus the marble pavement closes he is enter'd
 his radiant root away and to be blest
 let us with care perform his great behest
 the apparitions vanish
posthumus leonatus waking sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot
 a father to me and thou hast created
 a mother and two brothers but o scorn
 gone they went hence so soon as they were born
 and so i am awake poor wretches that depend
 on greatness favour dream as i have done
 wake and find nothing but alas i swerve
 many dream not to find neither deserve
 and yet are steep'd in favours so am i
 that have this golden chance and know not why
 what fairies haunt this ground a book o rare one
 be not as is our fangled world a garment
 nobler than that it covers let thy effects
 so follow to be most unlike our courtiers
 as good as promise
 reads
 when as a lion's whelp shall to himself unknown
 without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of
 tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be
 lopped branches which being dead many years
 shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and
 freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries
 britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty'
 tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
 tongue and brain not either both or nothing
 or senseless speaking or a speaking such
 as sense cannot untie be what it is
 the action of my life is like it which
 i'll keep if but for sympathy
 reenter first gaoler
first gaoler come sir are you ready for death
posthumus leonatus overroasted rather ready long ago
first gaoler hanging is the word sir if
 you be ready for that you are well cooked
posthumus leonatus so if i prove a good repast to the
 spectators the dish pays the shot
first gaoler a heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is
 you shall be called to no more payments fear no
 more tavernbills which are often the sadness of
 parting as the procuring of mirth you come in
 flint for want of meat depart reeling with too
 much drink sorry that you have paid too much and
 sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain
 both empty the brain the heavier for being too
 light the purse too light being drawn of
 heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be
 quit o the charity of a penny cord it sums up
 thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and
 creditor but it of what's past is and to come
 the discharge your neck sir is pen book and
 counters so the acquittance follows
posthumus leonatus i am merrier to die than thou art to live
first gaoler indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the
 toothache but a man that were to sleep your
 sleep and a hangman to help him to bed i think he
 would change places with his officer for look you
 sir you know not which way you shall go
posthumus leonatus yes indeed do i fellow
first gaoler your death has eyes in s head then i have not seen
 him so pictured you must either be directed by
 some that take upon them to know or do take upon
 yourself that which i am sure you do not know or
 jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how
 you shall speed in your journey's end i think you'll
 never return to tell one
posthumus leonatus i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to
 direct them the way i am going but such as wink and
 will not use them
first gaoler what an infinite mock is this that a man should
 have the best use of eyes to see the way of
 blindness i am sure hanging's the way of winking
 enter a messenger
messenger knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king
posthumus leonatus thou bring'st good news i am called to be made free
first gaoler i'll be hang'd then
posthumus leonatus thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the dead
 exeunt posthumus leonatus and messenger
first gaoler unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
 gibbets i never saw one so prone yet on my
 conscience there are verier knaves desire to live
 for all he be a roman and there be some of them
 too that die against their wills so should i if i
 were one i would we were all of one mind and one
 mind good o there were desolation of gaolers and
 gallowses i speak against my present profit but
 my wish hath a preferment in t

 enter cymbeline belarius guiderius arviragus
 pisanio lords officers and attendants
cymbeline stand by my side you whom the gods have made
 preservers of my throne woe is my heart
 that the poor soldier that so richly fought
 whose rags shamed gilded arms whose naked breast
 stepp'd before larges of proof cannot be found
 he shall be happy that can find him if
 our grace can make him so
belarius i never saw
 such noble fury in so poor a thing
 such precious deeds in one that promises nought
 but beggary and poor looks
cymbeline no tidings of him
pisanio he hath been search'd among the dead and living
 but no trace of him
cymbeline to my grief i am
 the heir of his reward
 to belarius guiderius and arviragus
 which i will add
 to you the liver heart and brain of britain
 by whom i grant she lives tis now the time
 to ask of whence you are report it
belarius sir
 in cambria are we born and gentlemen
 further to boast were neither true nor modest
 unless i add we are honest
cymbeline bow your knees
 arise my knights o the battle i create you
 companions to our person and will fit you
 with dignities becoming your estates
 enter cornelius and ladies
 there's business in these faces why so sadly
 greet you our victory you look like romans
 and not o the court of britain
cornelius hail great king
 to sour your happiness i must report
 the queen is dead
cymbeline who worse than a physician
 would this report become but i consider
 by medicine life may be prolong'd yet death
 will seize the doctor too how ended she
cornelius with horror madly dying like her life
 which being cruel to the world concluded
 most cruel to herself what she confess'd
 i will report so please you these her women
 can trip me if i err who with wet cheeks
 were present when she finish'd
cymbeline prithee say
cornelius first she confess'd she never loved you only
 affected greatness got by you not you
 married your royalty was wife to your place
 abhorr'd your person
cymbeline she alone knew this
 and but she spoke it dying i would not
 believe her lips in opening it proceed
cornelius your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
 with such integrity she did confess
 was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
 but that her flight prevented it she had
 ta'en off by poison
cymbeline o most delicate fiend
 who is t can read a woman is there more
cornelius more sir and worse she did confess she had
 for you a mortal mineral which being took
 should by the minute feed on life and lingering
 by inches waste you in which time she purposed
 by watching weeping tendance kissing to
 o'ercome you with her show and in time
 when she had fitted you with her craft to work
 her son into the adoption of the crown
 but failing of her end by his strange absence
 grew shamelessdesperate open'd in despite
 of heaven and men her purposes repented
 the evils she hatch'd were not effected so
 despairing died
cymbeline heard you all this her women
first lady we did so please your highness
cymbeline mine eyes
 were not in fault for she was beautiful
 mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
 that thought her like her seeming it had
 been vicious
 to have mistrusted her yet o my daughter
 that it was folly in me thou mayst say
 and prove it in thy feeling heaven mend all
 enter lucius iachimo the soothsayer and other
 roman prisoners guarded posthumus leonatus
 behind and imogen
 thou comest not caius now for tribute that
 the britons have razed out though with the loss
 of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
 that their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
 of you their captives which ourself have granted
 so think of your estate
caius lucius consider sir the chance of war the day
 was yours by accident had it gone with us
 we should not when the blood was cool
 have threaten'd
 our prisoners with the sword but since the gods
 will have it thus that nothing but our lives
 may be call'd ransom let it come sufficeth
 a roman with a roman's heart can suffer
 augustus lives to think on't and so much
 for my peculiar care this one thing only
 i will entreat my boy a briton born
 let him be ransom'd never master had
 a page so kind so duteous diligent
 so tender over his occasions true
 so feat so nurselike let his virtue join
 with my request which i make bold your highness
 cannot deny he hath done no briton harm
 though he have served a roman save him sir
 and spare no blood beside
cymbeline i have surely seen him
 his favour is familiar to me boy
 thou hast look'd thyself into my grace
 and art mine own i know not why wherefore
 to say live boy ne'er thank thy master live
 and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt
 fitting my bounty and thy state i'll give it
 yea though thou do demand a prisoner
 the noblest ta'en
imogen i humbly thank your highness
caius lucius i do not bid thee beg my life good lad
 and yet i know thou wilt
imogen no no alack
 there's other work in hand i see a thing
 bitter to me as death your life good master
 must shuffle for itself
caius lucius the boy disdains me
 he leaves me scorns me briefly die their joys
 that place them on the truth of girls and boys
 why stands he so perplex'd
cymbeline what wouldst thou boy
 i love thee more and more think more and more
 what's best to ask know'st him thou look'st on speak
 wilt have him live is he thy kin thy friend
imogen he is a roman no more kin to me
 than i to your highness who being born your vassal
 am something nearer
cymbeline wherefore eyest him so
imogen i'll tell you sir in private if you please
 to give me hearing
cymbeline ay with all my heart
 and lend my best attention what's thy name
imogen fidele sir
cymbeline thou'rt my good youth my page
 i'll be thy master walk with me speak freely
 cymbeline and imogen converse apart
belarius is not this boy revived from death
arviragus one sand another
 not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
 who died and was fidele what think you
guiderius the same dead thing alive
belarius peace peace see further he eyes us not forbear
 creatures may be alike were t he i am sure
 he would have spoke to us
guiderius but we saw him dead
belarius be silent let's see further
pisanio aside it is my mistress
 since she is living let the time run on
 to good or bad
 cymbeline and imogen come forward
cymbeline come stand thou by our side
 make thy demand aloud
 to iachimo
 sir step you forth
 give answer to this boy and do it freely
 or by our greatness and the grace of it
 which is our honour bitter torture shall
 winnow the truth from falsehood on speak to him
imogen my boon is that this gentleman may render
 of whom he had this ring
posthumus leonatus aside what's that to him
cymbeline that diamond upon your finger say
 how came it yours
iachimo thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
 which to be spoke would torture thee
cymbeline how me
iachimo i am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
 which torments me to conceal by villany
 i got this ring twas leonatus jewel
 whom thou didst banish andwhich more may
 grieve thee
 as it doth mea nobler sir ne'er lived
 twixt sky and ground wilt thou hear more my lord
cymbeline all that belongs to this
iachimo that paragon thy daughter
 for whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
 quail to remembergive me leave i faint
cymbeline my daughter what of her renew thy strength
 i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
 than die ere i hear more strive man and speak
iachimo upon a timeunhappy was the clock
 that struck the hourit was in romeaccursed
 the mansion where'twas at a feasto would
 our viands had been poison'd or at least
 those which i heaved to headthe good posthumus
 what should i say he was too good to be
 where ill men were and was the best of all
 amongst the rarest of good onessitting sadly
 hearing us praise our loves of italy
 for beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
 of him that best could speak for feature laming
 the shrine of venus or straightpight minerva
 postures beyond brief nature for condition
 a shop of all the qualities that man
 loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
 fairness which strikes the eye
cymbeline i stand on fire
 come to the matter
iachimo all too soon i shall
 unless thou wouldst grieve quickly this posthumus
 most like a noble lord in love and one
 that had a royal lover took his hint
 and not dispraising whom we praisedtherein
 he was as calm as virtuehe began
 his mistress picture which by his tongue
 being made
 and then a mind put in't either our brags
 were crack'd of kitchentrolls or his description
 proved us unspeaking sots
cymbeline nay nay to the purpose
iachimo your daughter's chastitythere it begins
 he spake of her as dian had hot dreams
 and she alone were cold whereat i wretch
 made scruple of his praise and wager'd with him
 pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore
 upon his honour'd finger to attain
 in suit the place of's bed and win this ring
 by hers and mine adultery he true knight
 no lesser of her honour confident
 than i did truly find her stakes this ring
 and would so had it been a carbuncle
 of phoebus wheel and might so safely had it
 been all the worth of's car away to britain
 post i in this design well may you sir
 remember me at court where i was taught
 of your chaste daughter the wide difference
 twixt amorous and villanous being thus quench'd
 of hope not longing mine italian brain
 gan in your duller britain operate
 most vilely for my vantage excellent
 and to be brief my practise so prevail'd
 that i return'd with simular proof enough
 to make the noble leonatus mad
 by wounding his belief in her renown
 with tokens thus and thus averting notes
 of chamberhanging pictures this her bracelet
 o cunning how i got itnay some marks
 of secret on her person that he could not
 but think her bond of chastity quite crack'd
 i having ta'en the forfeit whereupon
 methinks i see him now
posthumus leonatus advancing ay so thou dost
 italian fiend ay me most credulous fool
 egregious murderer thief any thing
 that's due to all the villains past in being
 to come o give me cord or knife or poison
 some upright justicer thou king send out
 for torturers ingenious it is i
 that all the abhorred things o the earth amend
 by being worse than they i am posthumus
 that kill'd thy daughtervillainlike i lie
 that caused a lesser villain than myself
 a sacrilegious thief to do't the temple
 of virtue was she yea and she herself
 spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set
 the dogs o the street to bay me every villain
 be call'd posthumus leonitus and
 be villany less than twas o imogen
 my queen my life my wife o imogen
 imogen imogen
imogen peace my lord hear hear
posthumus leonatus shall's have a play of this thou scornful page
 there lie thy part
 striking her she falls
pisanio o gentlemen help
 mine and your mistress o my lord posthumus
 you ne'er kill'd imogen til now help help
 mine honour'd lady
cymbeline does the world go round
posthumus leonatus how come these staggers on me
pisanio wake my mistress
cymbeline if this be so the gods do mean to strike me
 to death with mortal joy
pisanio how fares thy mistress
imogen o get thee from my sight
 thou gavest me poison dangerous fellow hence
 breathe not where princes are
cymbeline the tune of imogen
pisanio lady
 the gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
 that box i gave you was not thought by me
 a precious thing i had it from the queen
cymbeline new matter still
imogen it poison'd me
cornelius o gods
 i left out one thing which the queen confess'd
 which must approve thee honest if pisanio
 have said she given his mistress that confection
 which i gave him for cordial she is served
 as i would serve a rat'
cymbeline what's this comelius
cornelius the queen sir very oft importuned me
 to temper poisons for her still pretending
 the satisfaction of her knowledge only
 in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
 of no esteem i dreading that her purpose
 was of more danger did compound for her
 a certain stuff which being ta'en would cease
 the present power of life but in short time
 all offices of nature should again
 do their due functions have you ta'en of it
imogen most like i did for i was dead
belarius my boys
 there was our error
guiderius this is sure fidele
imogen why did you throw your wedded lady from you
 think that you are upon a rock and now
 throw me again
 embracing him
posthumus leonatus hang there like a fruit my soul
 till the tree die
cymbeline how now my flesh my child
 what makest thou me a dullard in this act
 wilt thou not speak to me
imogen kneeling your blessing sir
belarius to guiderius and arviragus though you did love
 this youth i blame ye not
 you had a motive for't
cymbeline my tears that fall
 prove holy water on thee imogen
 thy mother's dead
imogen i am sorry for't my lord
cymbeline o she was nought and long of her it was
 that we meet here so strangely but her son
 is gone we know not how nor where
pisanio my lord
 now fear is from me i'll speak troth lord cloten
 upon my lady's missing came to me
 with his sword drawn foam'd at the mouth and swore
 if i discover'd not which way she was gone
 it was my instant death by accident
 had a feigned letter of my master's
 then in my pocket which directed him
 to seek her on the mountains near to milford
 where in a frenzy in my master's garments
 which he enforced from me away he posts
 with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
 my lady's honour what became of him
 i further know not
guiderius let me end the story
 i slew him there
cymbeline marry the gods forfend
 i would not thy good deeds should from my lips
 pluck a bard sentence prithee valiant youth
 deny't again
guiderius i have spoke it and i did it
cymbeline he was a prince
guiderius a most incivil one the wrongs he did me
 were nothing princelike for he did provoke me
 with language that would make me spurn the sea
 if it could so roar to me i cut off's head
 and am right glad he is not standing here
 to tell this tale of mine
cymbeline i am sorry for thee
 by thine own tongue thou art condemn'd and must
 endure our law thou'rt dead
imogen that headless man
 i thought had been my lord
cymbeline bind the offender
 and take him from our presence
belarius stay sir king
 this man is better than the man he slew
 as well descended as thyself and hath
 more of thee merited than a band of clotens
 had ever scar for
 to the guard
 let his arms alone
 they were not born for bondage
cymbeline why old soldier
 wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
 by tasting of our wrath how of descent
 as good as we
arviragus in that he spake too far
cymbeline and thou shalt die for't
belarius we will die all three
 but i will prove that two on's are as good
 as i have given out him my sons i must
 for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
 though haply well for you
arviragus your danger's ours
guiderius and our good his
belarius have at it then by leave
 thou hadst great king a subject who
 was call'd belarius
cymbeline what of him he is
 a banish'd traitor
belarius he it is that hath
 assumed this age indeed a banish'd man
 i know not how a traitor
cymbeline take him hence
 the whole world shall not save him
belarius not too hot
 first pay me for the nursing of thy sons
 and let it be confiscate all so soon
 as i have received it
cymbeline nursing of my sons
belarius i am too blunt and saucy here's my knee
 ere i arise i will prefer my sons
 then spare not the old father mighty sir
 these two young gentlemen that call me father
 and think they are my sons are none of mine
 they are the issue of your loins my liege
 and blood of your begetting
cymbeline how my issue
belarius so sure as you your father's i old morgan
 am that belarius whom you sometime banish'd
 your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
 itself and all my treason that i suffer'd
 was all the harm i did these gentle princes
 for such and so they arethese twenty years
 have i train'd up those arts they have as i
 could put into them my breeding was sir as
 your highness knows their nurse euriphile
 whom for the theft i wedded stole these children
 upon my banishment i moved her to't
 having received the punishment before
 for that which i did then beaten for loyalty
 excited me to treason their dear loss
 the more of you twas felt the more it shaped
 unto my end of stealing them but gracious sir
 here are your sons again and i must lose
 two of the sweet'st companions in the world
 the benediction of these covering heavens
 fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
 to inlay heaven with stars
cymbeline thou weep'st and speak'st
 the service that you three have done is more
 unlike than this thou tell'st i lost my children
 if these be they i know not how to wish
 a pair of worthier sons
belarius be pleased awhile
 this gentleman whom i call polydore
 most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius
 this gentleman my cadwal arviragus
 your younger princely son he sir was lapp'd
 in a most curious mantle wrought by the hand
 of his queen mother which for more probation
 i can with ease produce
cymbeline guiderius had
 upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
 it was a mark of wonder
belarius this is he
 who hath upon him still that natural stamp
 it was wise nature's end in the donation
 to be his evidence now
cymbeline o what am i
 a mother to the birth of three ne'er mother
 rejoiced deliverance more blest pray you be
 that after this strange starting from your orbs
 may reign in them now o imogen
 thou hast lost by this a kingdom
imogen no my lord
 i have got two worlds by t o my gentle brothers
 have we thus met o never say hereafter
 but i am truest speaker you call'd me brother
 when i was but your sister i you brothers
 when ye were so indeed
cymbeline did you e'er meet
arviragus ay my good lord
guiderius and at first meeting loved
 continued so until we thought he died
cornelius by the queen's dram she swallow'd
cymbeline o rare instinct
 when shall i hear all through this fierce
 abridgement
 hath to it circumstantial branches which
 distinction should be rich in where how lived you
 and when came you to serve our roman captive
 how parted with your brothers how first met them
 why fled you from the court and whither these
 and your three motives to the battle with
 i know not how much more should be demanded
 and all the other bydependencies
 from chance to chance but nor the time nor place
 will serve our long inter'gatories see
 posthumus anchors upon imogen
 and she like harmless lightning throws her eye
 on him her brother me her master hitting
 each object with a joy the counterchange
 is severally in all let's quit this ground
 and smoke the temple with our sacrifices
 to belarius
 thou art my brother so we'll hold thee ever
imogen you are my father too and did relieve me
 to see this gracious season
cymbeline all o'erjoy'd
 save these in bonds let them be joyful too
 for they shall taste our comfort
imogen my good master
 i will yet do you service
caius lucius happy be you
cymbeline the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
 he would have well becomed this place and graced
 the thankings of a king
posthumus leonatus i am sir
 the soldier that did company these three
 in poor beseeming twas a fitment for
 the purpose i then follow'd that i was he
 speak iachimo i had you down and might
 have made you finish
iachimo kneeling i am down again
 but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
 as then your force did take that life beseech you
 which i so often owe but your ring first
 and here the bracelet of the truest princess
 that ever swore her faith
posthumus leonatus kneel not to me
 the power that i have on you is to spare you
 the malice towards you to forgive you live
 and deal with others better
cymbeline nobly doom'd
 we'll learn our freeness of a soninlaw
 pardon's the word to all
arviragus you holp us sir
 as you did mean indeed to be our brother
 joy'd are we that you are
posthumus leonatus your servant princes good my lord of rome
 call forth your soothsayer as i slept methought
 great jupiter upon his eagle back'd
 appear'd to me with other spritely shows
 of mine own kindred when i waked i found
 this label on my bosom whose containing
 is so from sense in hardness that i can
 make no collection of it let him show
 his skill in the construction
caius lucius philarmonus
soothsayer here my good lord
caius lucius read and declare the meaning
soothsayer reads when as a lion's whelp shall to himself
 unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a
 piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar
 shall be lopped branches which being dead many
 years shall after revive be jointed to the old
 stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end
 his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in
 peace and plenty'
 thou leonatus art the lion's whelp
 the fit and apt construction of thy name
 being leonatus doth import so much
 to cymbeline
 the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
 which we call mollis aer and mollis aer'
 we term it mulier which mulier i divine
 is this most constant wife who even now
 answering the letter of the oracle
 unknown to you unsought were clipp'd about
 with this most tender air
cymbeline this hath some seeming
soothsayer the lofty cedar royal cymbeline
 personates thee and thy lopp'd branches point
 thy two sons forth who by belarius stol'n
 for many years thought dead are now revived
 to the majestic cedar join'd whose issue
 promises britain peace and plenty
cymbeline well
 my peace we will begin and caius lucius
 although the victor we submit to caesar
 and to the roman empire promising
 to pay our wonted tribute from the which
 we were dissuaded by our wicked queen
 whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
 have laid most heavy hand
soothsayer the fingers of the powers above do tune
 the harmony of this peace the vision
 which i made known to lucius ere the stroke
 of this yet scarcecold battle at this instant
 is full accomplish'd for the roman eagle
 from south to west on wing soaring aloft
 lessen'd herself and in the beams o the sun
 so vanish'd which foreshow'd our princely eagle
 the imperial caesar should again unite
 his favour with the radiant cymbeline
 which shines here in the west
cymbeline laud we the gods
 and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
 from our blest altars publish we this peace
 to all our subjects set we forward let
 a roman and a british ensign wave
 friendly together so through lud'stown march
 and in the temple of great jupiter
 our peace we'll ratify seal it with feasts
 set on there never was a war did cease
 ere bloody hands were wash'd with such a peace

 the mind shall banquet though the body pine
 fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
 make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits
dumain my loving lord dumain is mortified
 the grosser manner of these world's delights
 he throws upon the gross world's baser slaves
 to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die
 with all these living in philosophy
biron i can but say their protestation over
 so much dear liege i have already sworn
 that is to live and study here three years
 but there are other strict observances
 as not to see a woman in that term
 which i hope well is not enrolled there
 and one day in a week to touch no food
 and but one meal on every day beside
 the which i hope is not enrolled there
 and then to sleep but three hours in the night
 and not be seen to wink of all the day
 when i was wont to think no harm all night
 and make a dark night too of half the day
 which i hope well is not enrolled there
 o these are barren tasks too hard to keep
 not to see ladies study fast not sleep
ferdinand your oath is pass'd to pass away from these
biron let me say no my liege an if you please
 i only swore to study with your grace
 and stay here in your court for three years space
longaville you swore to that biron and to the rest
biron by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest
 what is the end of study let me know
ferdinand why that to know which else we should not know
biron things hid and barr'd you mean from common sense
ferdinand ay that is study's godlike recompense
biron come on then i will swear to study so
 to know the thing i am forbid to know
 as thusto study where i well may dine
 when i to feast expressly am forbid
 or study where to meet some mistress fine
 when mistresses from common sense are hid
 or having sworn too hard a keeping oath
 study to break it and not break my troth
 if study's gain be thus and this be so
 study knows that which yet it doth not know
 swear me to this and i will ne'er say no
ferdinand these be the stops that hinder study quite
 and train our intellects to vain delight
biron why all delights are vain but that most vain
 which with pain purchased doth inherit pain
 as painfully to pore upon a book
 to seek the light of truth while truth the while
 doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
 light seeking light doth light of light beguile
 so ere you find where light in darkness lies
 your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
 study me how to please the eye indeed
 by fixing it upon a fairer eye
 who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
 and give him light that it was blinded by
 study is like the heaven's glorious sun
 that will not be deepsearch'd with saucy looks
 small have continual plodders ever won
 save base authority from others books
 these earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
 that give a name to every fixed star
 have no more profit of their shining nights
 than those that walk and wot not what they are
 too much to know is to know nought but fame
 and every godfather can give a name
ferdinand how well he's read to reason against reading
dumain proceeded well to stop all good proceeding
longaville he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding
biron the spring is near when green geese are abreeding
dumain how follows that
biron fit in his place and time
dumain in reason nothing
biron something then in rhyme
ferdinand biron is like an envious sneaping frost
 that bites the firstborn infants of the spring
biron well say i am why should proud summer boast
 before the birds have any cause to sing
 why should i joy in any abortive birth
 at christmas i no more desire a rose
 than wish a snow in may's newfangled mirth
 but like of each thing that in season grows
 so you to study now it is too late
 climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate
ferdinand well sit you out go home biron adieu
biron no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you
 and though i have for barbarism spoke more
 than for that angel knowledge you can say
 yet confident i'll keep what i have swore
 and bide the penance of each three years day
 give me the paper let me read the same
 and to the strict'st decrees i'll write my name
ferdinand how well this yielding rescues thee from shame
biron reads item that no woman shall come within a
 mile of my court hath this been proclaimed
longaville four days ago
biron let's see the penalty
 reads
 on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty
longaville marry that did i
biron sweet lord and why
longaville to fright them hence with that dread penalty
biron a dangerous law against gentility
 reads
 item if any man be seen to talk with a woman
 within the term of three years he shall endure such
 public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise'
 this article my liege yourself must break
 for well you know here comes in embassy
 the french king's daughter with yourself to speak
 a maid of grace and complete majesty
 about surrender up of aquitaine
 to her decrepit sick and bedrid father
 therefore this article is made in vain
 or vainly comes the admired princess hither
ferdinand what say you lords why this was quite forgot
biron so study evermore is overshot
 while it doth study to have what it would
 it doth forget to do the thing it should
 and when it hath the thing it hunteth most
 tis won as towns with fire so won so lost
ferdinand we must of force dispense with this decree
 she must lie here on mere necessity
biron necessity will make us all forsworn
 three thousand times within this three years space
 for every man with his affects is born
 not by might master'd but by special grace
 if i break faith this word shall speak for me
 i am forsworn on mere necessity'
 so to the laws at large i write my name
 subscribes
 and he that breaks them in the least degree
 stands in attainder of eternal shame
 suggestions are to other as to me
 but i believe although i seem so loath
 i am the last that will last keep his oath
 but is there no quick recreation granted
ferdinand ay that there is our court you know is haunted
 with a refined traveller of spain
 a man in all the world's new fashion planted
 that hath a mint of phrases in his brain
 one whom the music of his own vain tongue
 doth ravish like enchanting harmony
 a man of complements whom right and wrong
 have chose as umpire of their mutiny
 this child of fancy that armado hight
 for interim to our studies shall relate
 in highborn words the worth of many a knight
 from tawny spain lost in the world's debate
 how you delight my lords i know not i
 but i protest i love to hear him lie
 and i will use him for my minstrelsy
biron armado is a most illustrious wight
 a man of firenew words fashion's own knight
longaville costard the swain and he shall be our sport
 and so to study three years is but short
 enter dull with a letter and costard
dull which is the duke's own person
biron this fellow what wouldst
dull i myself reprehend his own person for i am his
 grace's tharborough but i would see his own person
 in flesh and blood
biron this is he
dull signior armearmecommends you there's villany
 abroad this letter will tell you more
costard sir the contempts thereof are as touching me
ferdinand a letter from the magnificent armado
biron how low soever the matter i hope in god for high words
longaville a high hope for a low heaven god grant us patience
biron to hear or forbear laughing
longaville to hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to
 forbear both
biron well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to
 climb in the merriness
costard the matter is to me sir as concerning jaquenetta
 the manner of it is i was taken with the manner
biron in what manner
costard in manner and form following sir all those three
 i was seen with her in the manorhouse sitting with
 her upon the form and taken following her into the
 park which put together is in manner and form
 following now sir for the mannerit is the
 manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form
 in some form
biron for the following sir
costard as it shall follow in my correction and god defend
 the right
ferdinand will you hear this letter with attention
biron as we would hear an oracle
costard such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh
ferdinand reads great deputy the welkin's vicegerent and
 sole dominator of navarre my soul's earth's god
 and body's fostering patron'
costard not a word of costard yet
ferdinand reads so it is'
costard it may be so but if he say it is so he is in
 telling true but so
ferdinand peace
costard be to me and every man that dares not fight
ferdinand no words
costard of other men's secrets i beseech you
ferdinand reads so it is besieged with sablecoloured
 melancholy i did commend the blackoppressing humour
 to the most wholesome physic of thy healthgiving
 air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to
 walk the time when about the sixth hour when
 beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down
 to that nourishment which is called supper so much
 for the time when now for the ground which which
 i mean i walked upon it is ycleped thy park then
 for the place where where i mean i did encounter
 that obscene and preposterous event that draweth
 from my snowwhite pen the eboncoloured ink which
 here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest
 but to the place where it standeth northnortheast
 and by east from the west corner of thy curious
 knotted garden there did i see that lowspirited
 swain that base minnow of thy mirth'
costard me
ferdinand reads that unlettered smallknowing soul'
costard me
ferdinand reads that shallow vassal'
costard still me
ferdinand reads which as i remember hight costard'
costard o me
ferdinand reads sorted and consorted contrary to thy
 established proclaimed edict and continent canon
 which witho withbut with this i passion to say
 wherewith
costard with a wench
ferdinand reads with a child of our grandmother eve a
 female or for thy more sweet understanding a
 woman him i as my everesteemed duty pricks me on
 have sent to thee to receive the meed of
 punishment by thy sweet grace's officer anthony
 dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and
 estimation'
dull me an't shall please you i am anthony dull
ferdinand reads for jaquenettaso is the weaker vessel
 called which i apprehended with the aforesaid
 swaini keep her as a vessel of the law's fury
 and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring
 her to trial thine in all compliments of devoted
 and heartburning heat of duty
 don adriano de armado'
biron this is not so well as i looked for but the best
 that ever i heard
ferdinand ay the best for the worst but sirrah what say
 you to this
costard sir i confess the wench
ferdinand did you hear the proclamation
costard i do confess much of the hearing it but little of
 the marking of it
ferdinand it was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken
 with a wench
costard i was taken with none sir i was taken with a damsel
ferdinand well it was proclaimed damsel'
costard this was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin
ferdinand it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin'
costard if it were i deny her virginity i was taken with a maid
ferdinand this maid will not serve your turn sir
costard this maid will serve my turn sir
ferdinand sir i will pronounce your sentence you shall fast
 a week with bran and water
costard i had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge
ferdinand and don armado shall be your keeper
 my lord biron see him deliver'd o'er
 and go we lords to put in practise that
 which each to other hath so strongly sworn
 exeunt ferdinand longaville and dumain
biron i'll lay my head to any good man's hat
 these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn
 sirrah come on
costard i suffer for the truth sir for true it is i was
 taken with jaquenetta and jaquenetta is a true
 girl and therefore welcome the sour cup of
 prosperity affliction may one day smile again and
 till then sit thee down sorrow
 exeunt
 love's labours lost
act i
scene ii the same
 enter don adriano de armado and moth
don
adriano de armado boy what sign is it when a man of great spirit
 grows melancholy
moth a great sign sir that he will look sad
don
adriano de armado why sadness is one and the selfsame thing dear imp
moth no no o lord sir no
don
adriano de armado how canst thou part sadness and melancholy my
 tender juvenal
moth by a familiar demonstration of the working my tough senior
don
adriano de armado why tough senior why tough senior
moth why tender juvenal why tender juvenal
don
adriano de armado i spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton
 appertaining to thy young days which we may
 nominate tender
moth and i tough senior as an appertinent title to your
 old time which we may name tough
don adriano de
armado pretty and apt
moth how mean you sir i pretty and my saying apt or
 i apt and my saying pretty
don
adriano de armado thou pretty because little
moth little pretty because little wherefore apt
don
adriano de armado and therefore apt because quick
moth speak you this in my praise master
don
adriano de armado in thy condign praise
moth i will praise an eel with the same praise
don
adriano de armado what that an eel is ingenious
moth that an eel is quick
don
adriano de armado i do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood
moth i am answered sir
don
adriano de armado i love not to be crossed
moth aside he speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him
don
adriano de armado i have promised to study three years with the duke
moth you may do it in an hour sir
don
adriano de armado impossible
moth how many is one thrice told
don
adriano de armado i am ill at reckoning it fitteth the spirit of a tapster
moth you are a gentleman and a gamester sir
don
adriano de armado i confess both they are both the varnish of a
 complete man
moth then i am sure you know how much the gross sum of
 deuceace amounts to
don
adriano de armado it doth amount to one more than two
moth which the base vulgar do call three
don
adriano de armado true
moth why sir is this such a piece of study now here
 is three studied ere ye'll thrice wink and how
 easy it is to put years to the word three and
 study three years in two words the dancing horse
 will tell you
don
adriano de armado a most fine figure
moth to prove you a cipher
don
adriano de armado i will hereupon confess i am in love and as it is
 base for a soldier to love so am i in love with a
 base wench if drawing my sword against the humour
 of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
 thought of it i would take desire prisoner and
 ransom him to any french courtier for a newdevised
 courtesy i think scorn to sigh methinks i should
 outswear cupid comfort me boy what great men
 have been in love
moth hercules master
don
adriano de armado most sweet hercules more authority dear boy name
 more and sweet my child let them be men of good
 repute and carriage
moth samson master he was a man of good carriage great
 carriage for he carried the towngates on his back
 like a porter and he was in love
don
adriano de armado o wellknit samson strongjointed samson i do
 excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
 carrying gates i am in love too who was samson's
 love my dear moth
moth a woman master
don
adriano de armado of what complexion
moth of all the four or the three or the two or one of the four
don
adriano de armado tell me precisely of what complexion
moth of the seawater green sir
don
adriano de armado is that one of the four complexions
moth as i have read sir and the best of them too
don
adriano de armado green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a
 love of that colour methinks samson had small reason
 for it he surely affected her for her wit
moth it was so sir for she had a green wit
don
adriano de armado my love is most immaculate white and red
moth most maculate thoughts master are masked under
 such colours
don
adriano de armado define define welleducated infant
moth my father's wit and my mother's tongue assist me
don
adriano de armado sweet invocation of a child most pretty and
 pathetical
moth if she be made of white and red
 her faults will ne'er be known
 for blushing cheeks by faults are bred
 and fears by pale white shown
 then if she fear or be to blame
 by this you shall not know
 for still her cheeks possess the same
 which native she doth owe
 a dangerous rhyme master against the reason of
 white and red
don
adriano de armado is there not a ballad boy of the king and the beggar
moth the world was very guilty of such a ballad some
 three ages since but i think now tis not to be
 found or if it were it would neither serve for
 the writing nor the tune
don
adriano de armado i will have that subject newly writ o'er that i may
 example my digression by some mighty precedent
 boy i do love that country girl that i took in the
 park with the rational hind costard she deserves well
moth aside to be whipped and yet a better love than
 my master
don
adriano de armado sing boy my spirit grows heavy in love
moth and that's great marvel loving a light wench
don
adriano de armado i say sing
moth forbear till this company be past
 enter dull costard and jaquenetta
dull sir the duke's pleasure is that you keep costard
 safe and you must suffer him to take no delight
 nor no penance but a must fast three days a week
 for this damsel i must keep her at the park she
 is allowed for the daywoman fare you well
don
adriano de armado i do betray myself with blushing maid
jaquenetta man
don
adriano de armado i will visit thee at the lodge
jaquenetta that's hereby
don
adriano de armado i know where it is situate
jaquenetta lord how wise you are
don
adriano de armado i will tell thee wonders
jaquenetta with that face
don
adriano de armado i love thee
jaquenetta so i heard you say
don
adriano de armado and so farewell
jaquenetta fair weather after you
dull come jaquenetta away
 exeunt dull and jaquenetta
don
adriano de armado villain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
 be pardoned
costard well sir i hope when i do it i shall do it on a
 full stomach
don
adriano de armado thou shalt be heavily punished
costard i am more bound to you than your fellows for they
 are but lightly rewarded
don
adriano de armado take away this villain shut him up
moth come you transgressing slave away
costard let me not be pent up sir i will fast being loose
moth no sir that were fast and loose thou shalt to prison
costard well if ever i do see the merry days of desolation
 that i have seen some shall see
moth what shall some see
costard nay nothing master moth but what they look upon
 it is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
 words and therefore i will say nothing i thank
 god i have as little patience as another man and
 therefore i can be quiet
 exeunt moth and costard
don
adriano de armado i do affect the very ground which is base where
 her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which
 is basest doth tread i shall be forsworn which
 is a great argument of falsehood if i love and
 how can that be true love which is falsely
 attempted love is a familiar love is a devil
 there is no evil angel but love yet was samson so
 tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was
 solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit
 cupid's buttshaft is too hard for hercules club
 and therefore too much odds for a spaniard's rapier
 the first and second cause will not serve my turn
 the passado he respects not the duello he regards
 not his disgrace is to be called boy but his
 glory is to subdue men adieu valour rust rapier
 be still drum for your manager is in love yea
 he loveth assist me some extemporal god of rhyme
 for i am sure i shall turn sonnet devise wit
 write pen for i am for whole volumes in folio

 love's labours lost
act ii
scene i the same
 enter the princess of france rosaline maria
 katharine boyet lords and other attendants
boyet now madam summon up your dearest spirits
 consider who the king your father sends
 to whom he sends and what's his embassy
 yourself held precious in the world's esteem
 to parley with the sole inheritor
 of all perfections that a man may owe
 matchless navarre the plea of no less weight
 than aquitaine a dowry for a queen
 be now as prodigal of all dear grace
 as nature was in making graces dear
 when she did starve the general world beside
 and prodigally gave them all to you
princess good lord boyet my beauty though but mean
 needs not the painted flourish of your praise
 beauty is bought by judgement of the eye
 not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues
 i am less proud to hear you tell my worth
 than you much willing to be counted wise
 in spending your wit in the praise of mine
 but now to task the tasker good boyet
 you are not ignorant alltelling fame
 doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow
 till painful study shall outwear three years
 no woman may approach his silent court
 therefore to's seemeth it a needful course
 before we enter his forbidden gates
 to know his pleasure and in that behalf
 bold of your worthiness we single you
 as our bestmoving fair solicitor
 tell him the daughter of the king of france
 on serious business craving quick dispatch
 importunes personal conference with his grace
 haste signify so much while we attend
 like humblevisaged suitors his high will
boyet proud of employment willingly i go
princess all pride is willing pride and yours is so
 exit boyet
 who are the votaries my loving lords
 that are vowfellows with this virtuous duke
first lord lord longaville is one
princess know you the man
maria i know him madam at a marriagefeast
 between lord perigort and the beauteous heir
 of jaques falconbridge solemnized
 in normandy saw i this longaville
 a man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd
 well fitted in arts glorious in arms
 nothing becomes him ill that he would well
 the only soil of his fair virtue's gloss
 if virtue's gloss will stain with any soil
 is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will
 whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills
 it should none spare that come within his power
princess some merry mocking lord belike is't so
maria they say so most that most his humours know
princess such shortlived wits do wither as they grow
 who are the rest
katharine the young dumain a wellaccomplished youth
 of all that virtue love for virtue loved
 most power to do most harm least knowing ill
 for he hath wit to make an ill shape good
 and shape to win grace though he had no wit
 i saw him at the duke alencon's once
 and much too little of that good i saw
 is my report to his great worthiness
rosaline another of these students at that time
 was there with him if i have heard a truth
 biron they call him but a merrier man
 within the limit of becoming mirth
 i never spent an hour's talk withal
 his eye begets occasion for his wit
 for every object that the one doth catch
 the other turns to a mirthmoving jest
 which his fair tongue conceit's expositor
 delivers in such apt and gracious words
 that aged ears play truant at his tales
 and younger hearings are quite ravished
 so sweet and voluble is his discourse
princess god bless my ladies are they all in love
 that every one her own hath garnished
 with such bedecking ornaments of praise
first lord here comes boyet
 reenter boyet
princess now what admittance lord
boyet navarre had notice of your fair approach
 and he and his competitors in oath
 were all address'd to meet you gentle lady
 before i came marry thus much i have learnt
 he rather means to lodge you in the field
 like one that comes here to besiege his court
 than seek a dispensation for his oath
 to let you enter his unpeopled house
 here comes navarre
 enter ferdinand longaville dumain biron and
 attendants
ferdinand fair princess welcome to the court of navarre
princess fair i give you back again and welcome i have
 not yet the roof of this court is too high to be
 yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine
ferdinand you shall be welcome madam to my court
princess i will be welcome then conduct me thither
ferdinand hear me dear lady i have sworn an oath
princess our lady help my lord he'll be forsworn
ferdinand not for the world fair madam by my will
princess why will shall break it will and nothing else
ferdinand your ladyship is ignorant what it is
princess were my lord so his ignorance were wise
 where now his knowledge must prove ignorance
 i hear your grace hath sworn out housekeeping
 tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord
 and sin to break it
 but pardon me i am too suddenbold
 to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
 vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
 and suddenly resolve me in my suit
ferdinand madam i will if suddenly i may
princess you will the sooner that i were away
 for you'll prove perjured if you make me stay
biron did not i dance with you in brabant once
rosaline did not i dance with you in brabant once
biron i know you did
rosaline how needless was it then to ask the question
biron you must not be so quick
rosaline tis long of you that spur me with such questions
biron your wit's too hot it speeds too fast twill tire
rosaline not till it leave the rider in the mire
biron what time o day
rosaline the hour that fools should ask
biron now fair befall your mask
rosaline fair fall the face it covers
biron and send you many lovers
rosaline amen so you be none
biron nay then will i be gone
ferdinand madam your father here doth intimate
 the payment of a hundred thousand crowns
 being but the one half of an entire sum
 disbursed by my father in his wars
 but say that he or we as neither have
 received that sum yet there remains unpaid
 a hundred thousand more in surety of the which
 one part of aquitaine is bound to us
 although not valued to the money's worth
 if then the king your father will restore
 but that one half which is unsatisfied
 we will give up our right in aquitaine
 and hold fair friendship with his majesty
 but that it seems he little purposeth
 for here he doth demand to have repaid
 a hundred thousand crowns and not demands
 on payment of a hundred thousand crowns
 to have his title live in aquitaine
 which we much rather had depart withal
 and have the money by our father lent
 than aquitaine so gelded as it is
 dear princess were not his requests so far
 from reason's yielding your fair self should make
 a yielding gainst some reason in my breast
 and go well satisfied to france again
princess you do the king my father too much wrong
 and wrong the reputation of your name
 in so unseeming to confess receipt
 of that which hath so faithfully been paid
ferdinand i do protest i never heard of it
 and if you prove it i'll repay it back
 or yield up aquitaine
princess we arrest your word
 boyet you can produce acquittances
 for such a sum from special officers
 of charles his father
ferdinand satisfy me so
boyet so please your grace the packet is not come
 where that and other specialties are bound
 tomorrow you shall have a sight of them
ferdinand it shall suffice me at which interview
 all liberal reason i will yield unto
 meantime receive such welcome at my hand
 as honour without breach of honour may
 make tender of to thy true worthiness
 you may not come fair princess in my gates
 but here without you shall be so received
 as you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart
 though so denied fair harbour in my house
 your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
 tomorrow shall we visit you again
princess sweet health and fair desires consort your grace
ferdinand thy own wish wish i thee in every place
 exit
biron lady i will commend you to mine own heart
rosaline pray you do my commendations i would be glad to see it
biron i would you heard it groan
rosaline is the fool sick
biron sick at the heart
rosaline alack let it blood
biron would that do it good
rosaline my physic says ay'
biron will you prick't with your eye
rosaline no point with my knife
biron now god save thy life
rosaline and yours from long living
biron i cannot stay thanksgiving
 retiring
dumain sir i pray you a word what lady is that same
boyet the heir of alencon katharine her name
dumain a gallant lady monsieur fare you well
 exit
longaville i beseech you a word what is she in the white
boyet a woman sometimes an you saw her in the light
longaville perchance light in the light i desire her name
boyet she hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
longaville pray you sir whose daughter
boyet her mother's i have heard
longaville god's blessing on your beard
boyet good sir be not offended
 she is an heir of falconbridge
longaville nay my choler is ended
 she is a most sweet lady

 exit longaville
biron what's her name in the cap
boyet rosaline by good hap
biron is she wedded or no
boyet to her will sir or so
biron you are welcome sir adieu
boyet farewell to me sir and welcome to you
 exit biron
maria that last is biron the merry madcap lord
 not a word with him but a jest
boyet and every jest but a word
princess it was well done of you to take him at his word
boyet i was as willing to grapple as he was to board
maria two hot sheeps marry
boyet and wherefore not ships
 no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips
maria you sheep and i pasture shall that finish the jest
boyet so you grant pasture for me
 offering to kiss her
maria not so gentle beast
 my lips are no common though several they be
boyet belonging to whom
maria to my fortunes and me
princess good wits will be jangling but gentles agree
 this civil war of wits were much better used
 on navarre and his bookmen for here tis abused
boyet if my observation which very seldom lies
 by the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes
 deceive me not now navarre is infected
princess with what
boyet with that which we lovers entitle affected
princess your reason
boyet why all his behaviors did make their retire
 to the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
 his heart like an agate with your print impress'd
 proud with his form in his eye pride express'd
 his tongue all impatient to speak and not see
 did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
 all senses to that sense did make their repair
 to feel only looking on fairest of fair
 methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye
 as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy
 who tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd
 did point you to buy them along as you pass'd
 his face's own margent did quote such amazes
 that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
 i'll give you aquitaine and all that is his
 an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss
princess come to our pavilion boyet is disposed
boyet but to speak that in words which his eye hath
 disclosed
 i only have made a mouth of his eye

 that we must stand and play the murderer in
forester hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice
 a stand where you may make the fairest shoot
princess i thank my beauty i am fair that shoot
 and thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot
forester pardon me madam for i meant not so
princess what what first praise me and again say no
 o shortlived pride not fair alack for woe
forester yes madam fair
princess nay never paint me now
 where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow
 here good my glass take this for telling true
 fair payment for foul words is more than due
forester nothing but fair is that which you inherit
princess see see my beauty will be saved by merit
 o heresy in fair fit for these days
 a giving hand though foul shall have fair praise
 but come the bow now mercy goes to kill
 and shooting well is then accounted ill
 thus will i save my credit in the shoot
 not wounding pity would not let me do't
 if wounding then it was to show my skill
 that more for praise than purpose meant to kill
 and out of question so it is sometimes
 glory grows guilty of detested crimes
 when for fame's sake for praise an outward part
 we bend to that the working of the heart
 as i for praise alone now seek to spill
 the poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill
boyet do not curst wives hold that selfsovereignty
 only for praise sake when they strive to be
 lords o'er their lords
princess only for praise and praise we may afford
 to any lady that subdues a lord

 true that thou art beauteous truth itself that

 commiseration on thy heroical vassal the
 magnanimous and most illustrate king cophetua set
 eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
 zenelophon and he it was that might rightly say
 veni vidi vici which to annothanize in the
 vulgaro base and obscure vulgarvidelicet he
 came saw and overcame he came one saw two
 overcame three who came the king why did he
 come to see why did he see to overcome to
 whom came he to the beggar what saw he the
 beggar who overcame he the beggar the
 conclusion is victory on whose side the king's
 the captive is enriched on whose side the
 beggar's the catastrophe is a nuptial on whose
 side the king's no on both in one or one in
 both i am the king for so stands the comparison
 thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy lowliness
 shall i command thy love i may shall i enforce
 thy love i could shall i entreat thy love i
 will what shalt thou exchange for rags robes
 for tittles titles for thyself me thus
 expecting thy reply i profane my lips on thy foot
 my eyes on thy picture and my heart on thy every
 part thine in the dearest design of industry

scene ii the same
 enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull
sir nathaniel very reverend sport truly and done in the testimony
 of a good conscience
holofernes the deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe
 as the pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in
 the ear of caelo the sky the welkin the heaven
 and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra
 the soil the land the earth
sir nathaniel truly master holofernes the epithets are sweetly
 varied like a scholar at the least but sir i
 assure ye it was a buck of the first head
holofernes sir nathaniel haud credo
dull twas not a haud credo twas a pricket
holofernes most barbarous intimation yet a kind of
 insinuation as it were in via in way of
 explication facere as it were replication or
 rather ostentare to show as it were his
 inclination after his undressed unpolished
 uneducated unpruned untrained or rather
 unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion to
 insert again my haud credo for a deer
dull i said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket
holofernes twicesod simplicity his coctus
 o thou monster ignorance how deformed dost thou look
sir nathaniel sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
 in a book he hath not eat paper as it were he
 hath not drunk ink his intellect is not
 replenished he is only an animal only sensible in
 the duller parts
 and such barren plants are set before us that we
 thankful should be
 which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that
 do fructify in us more than he
 for as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool
 so were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school
 but omne bene say i being of an old father's mind
 many can brook the weather that love not the wind
dull you two are bookmen can you tell me by your wit
 what was a month old at cain's birth that's not five
 weeks old as yet
holofernes dictynna goodman dull dictynna goodman dull
dull what is dictynna
sir nathaniel a title to phoebe to luna to the moon
holofernes the moon was a month old when adam was no more
 and raught not to five weeks when he came to
 fivescore
 the allusion holds in the exchange
dull tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange
holofernes god comfort thy capacity i say the allusion holds
 in the exchange
dull and i say the pollusion holds in the exchange for
 the moon is never but a month old and i say beside
 that twas a pricket that the princess killed
holofernes sir nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph
 on the death of the deer and to humour the
 ignorant call i the deer the princess killed a pricket
sir nathaniel perge good master holofernes perge so it shall
 please you to abrogate scurrility
holofernes i will something affect the letter for it argues facility
 the preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
 pleasing pricket
 some say a sore but not a sore till now made
 sore with shooting
 the dogs did yell put l to sore then sorel jumps
 from thicket
 or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall ahooting
 if sore be sore then l to sore makes fifty sores
 one sorel
 of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more l
sir nathaniel a rare talent
dull aside if a talent be a claw look how he claws
 him with a talent
holofernes this is a gift that i have simple simple a
 foolish extravagant spirit full of forms figures
 shapes objects ideas apprehensions motions
 revolutions these are begot in the ventricle of
 memory nourished in the womb of pia mater and
 delivered upon the mellowing of occasion but the
 gift is good in those in whom it is acute and i am
 thankful for it
sir nathaniel sir i praise the lord for you and so may my
 parishioners for their sons are well tutored by
 you and their daughters profit very greatly under
 you you are a good member of the commonwealth
holofernes mehercle if their sons be ingenuous they shall
 want no instruction if their daughters be capable
 i will put it to them but vir sapit qui pauca
 loquitur a soul feminine saluteth us
 enter jaquenetta and costard
jaquenetta god give you good morrow master parson
holofernes master parson quasi person an if one should be
 pierced which is the one
costard marry master schoolmaster he that is likest to a hogshead

 tuft of earth fire enough for a flint pearl enough
 for a swine tis pretty it is well
jaquenetta good master parson be so good as read me this
 letter it was given me by costard and sent me

 under pardon sir what are the contents or rather
 as horace says in hiswhat my soul verses
sir nathaniel ay sir and very learned
holofernes let me hear a staff a stanze a verse lege domine
sir nathaniel reads
 if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
 ah never faith could hold if not to beauty vow'd
 though to myself forsworn to thee i'll faithful prove
 those thoughts to me were oaks to thee like
 osiers bow'd
 study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
 where all those pleasures live that art would
 comprehend
 if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
 well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
 all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
 which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
 thy eye jove's lightning bears thy voice his dreadful thunder
 which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
 celestial as thou art o pardon love this wrong
 that sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue
holofernes you find not the apostraphas and so miss the
 accent let me supervise the canzonet here are
 only numbers ratified but for the elegancy
 facility and golden cadence of poesy caret
 ovidius naso was the man and why indeed naso
 but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
 fancy the jerks of invention imitari is nothing
 so doth the hound his master the ape his keeper
 the tired horse his rider but damosella virgin
 was this directed to you
jaquenetta ay sir from one monsieur biron one of the strange
 queen's lords
holofernes i will overglance the superscript to the

 to the person written unto your ladyship's in all
 desired employment biron sir nathaniel this

 of mine where if before repast it shall please
 you to gratify the table with a grace i will on my
 privilege i have with the parents of the foresaid
 child or pupil undertake your ben venuto where i

 neither savouring of poetry wit nor invention i
 beseech your society

 the happiness of life
holofernes and certes the text most infallibly concludes it
 to dull
 sir i do invite you too you shall not

 eyeby this light but for her eye i would not
 love her yes for her two eyes well i do nothing

 heaven i do love and it hath taught me to rhyme
 and to be melancholy and here is part of my rhyme
 and here my melancholy well she hath one o my

 stands aside
 enter ferdinand with a paper
ferdinand ay me
biron aside shot by heaven proceed sweet cupid
 thou hast thumped him with thy birdbolt under the
 left pap in faith secrets
ferdinand reads
 so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
 to those fresh morning drops upon the rose
 as thy eyebeams when their fresh rays have smote
 the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
 nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
 through the transparent bosom of the deep
 as doth thy face through tears of mine give light
 thou shinest in every tear that i do weep
 no drop but as a coach doth carry thee
 so ridest thou triumphing in my woe
 do but behold the tears that swell in me
 and they thy glory through my grief will show
 but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep
 my tears for glasses and still make me weep
 o queen of queens how far dost thou excel
 no thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell
 how shall she know my griefs i'll drop the paper
 sweet leaves shade folly who is he comes here
 steps aside
 what longaville and reading listen ear
biron now in thy likeness one more fool appear
 enter longaville with a paper
longaville ay me i am forsworn
biron why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers
ferdinand in love i hope sweet fellowship in shame
biron one drunkard loves another of the name
longaville am i the first that have been perjured so
biron i could put thee in comfort not by two that i know
 thou makest the triumviry the cornercap of society
 the shape of love's tyburn that hangs up simplicity
longaville i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
 o sweet maria empress of my love
 these numbers will i tear and write in prose
biron o rhymes are guards on wanton cupid's hose
 disfigure not his slop
longaville this same shall go
 reads
 did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
 gainst whom the world cannot hold argument
 persuade my heart to this false perjury
 vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
 a woman i forswore but i will prove
 thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
 my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
 thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me
 vows are but breath and breath a vapour is
 then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine
 exhalest this vapourvow in thee it is
 if broken then it is no fault of mine
 if by me broke what fool is not so wise
 to lose an oath to win a paradise
biron this is the livervein which makes flesh a deity
 a green goose a goddess pure pure idolatry
 god amend us god amend we are much out o the way
longaville by whom shall i send thiscompany stay
 steps aside
biron all hid all hid an old infant play
 like a demigod here sit i in the sky
 and wretched fools secrets heedfully o'ereye
 more sacks to the mill o heavens i have my wish
 enter dumain with a paper
 dumain transform'd four woodcocks in a dish
dumain o most divine kate
biron o most profane coxcomb
dumain by heaven the wonder in a mortal eye
biron by earth she is not corporal there you lie
dumain her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted
biron an ambercolour'd raven was well noted
dumain as upright as the cedar
biron stoop i say
 her shoulder is with child
dumain as fair as day
biron ay as some days but then no sun must shine
dumain o that i had my wish
longaville and i had mine
ferdinand and i mine too good lord
biron amen so i had mine is not that a good word
dumain i would forget her but a fever she
 reigns in my blood and will remember'd be
biron a fever in your blood why then incision
 would let her out in saucers sweet misprision
dumain once more i'll read the ode that i have writ
biron once more i'll mark how love can vary wit
dumain reads
 on a dayalack the day
 love whose month is ever may
 spied a blossom passing fair
 playing in the wanton air
 through the velvet leaves the wind
 all unseen can passage find
 that the lover sick to death
 wish himself the heaven's breath
 air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
 air would i might triumph so
 but alack my hand is sworn
 ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
 vow alack for youth unmeet
 youth so apt to pluck a sweet
 do not call it sin in me
 that i am forsworn for thee
 thou for whom jove would swear
 juno but an ethiope were
 and deny himself for jove
 turning mortal for thy love
 this will i send and something else more plain
 that shall express my true love's fasting pain
 o would the king biron and longaville
 were lovers too ill to example ill
 would from my forehead wipe a perjured note
 for none offend where all alike do dote
longaville advancing dumain thy love is far from charity
 you may look pale but i should blush i know
 to be o'erheard and taken napping so
ferdinand advancing come sir you blush as his your case is such
 you chide at him offending twice as much
 you do not love maria longaville
 did never sonnet for her sake compile
 nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
 his loving bosom to keep down his heart
 i have been closely shrouded in this bush
 and mark'd you both and for you both did blush
 i heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion
 saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
 ay me says one o jove the other cries
 one her hairs were gold crystal the other's eyes
 to longaville
 you would for paradise break faith and troth
 to dumain
 and jove for your love would infringe an oath
 what will biron say when that he shall hear
 faith so infringed which such zeal did swear
 how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
 how will he triumph leap and laugh at it
 for all the wealth that ever i did see
 i would not have him know so much by me
biron now step i forth to whip hypocrisy
 advancing
 ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me
 good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
 these worms for loving that art most in love
 your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
 there is no certain princess that appears
 you'll not be perjured tis a hateful thing
 tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
 but are you not ashamed nay are you not
 all three of you to be thus much o'ershot
 you found his mote the king your mote did see
 but i a beam do find in each of three
 o what a scene of foolery have i seen
 of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
 o me with what strict patience have i sat
 to see a king transformed to a gnat
 to see great hercules whipping a gig
 and profound solomon to tune a jig
 and nestor play at pushpin with the boys
 and critic timon laugh at idle toys
 where lies thy grief o tell me good dumain
 and gentle longaville where lies thy pain
 and where my liege's all about the breast
 a caudle ho
ferdinand too bitter is thy jest
 are we betray'd thus to thy overview
biron not you to me but i betray'd by you
 i that am honest i that hold it sin
 to break the vow i am engaged in
 i am betray'd by keeping company
 with men like men of inconstancy
 when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
 or groan for love or spend a minute's time
 in pruning me when shall you hear that i
 will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
 a gait a state a brow a breast a waist
 a leg a limb
ferdinand soft whither away so fast
 a true man or a thief that gallops so
biron i post from love good lover let me go
 enter jaquenetta and costard
jaquenetta god bless the king
ferdinand what present hast thou there
costard some certain treason
ferdinand what makes treason here
costard nay it makes nothing sir
ferdinand if it mar nothing neither
 the treason and you go in peace away together
jaquenetta i beseech your grace let this letter be read
 our parson misdoubts it twas treason he said
ferdinand biron read it over
 giving him the paper
 where hadst thou it
jaquenetta of costard
ferdinand where hadst thou it
costard of dun adramadio dun adramadio
 biron tears the letter
ferdinand how now what is in you why dost thou tear it
biron a toy my liege a toy your grace needs not fear it
longaville it did move him to passion and therefore let's hear it
dumain it is biron's writing and here is his name
 gathering up the pieces
biron to costard ah you whoreson loggerhead you were
 born to do me shame
 guilty my lord guilty i confess i confess
ferdinand what
biron that you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess
 he he and you and you my liege and i
 are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die
 o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more
dumain now the number is even
biron true true we are four
 will these turtles be gone
ferdinand hence sirs away
costard walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay
 exeunt costard and jaquenetta
biron sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace
 as true we are as flesh and blood can be
 the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face
 young blood doth not obey an old decree
 we cannot cross the cause why we were born
 therefore of all hands must we be forsworn
ferdinand what did these rent lines show some love of thine
biron did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline
 that like a rude and savage man of inde
 at the first opening of the gorgeous east
 bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
 kisses the base ground with obedient breast
 what peremptory eaglesighted eye
 dares look upon the heaven of her brow
 that is not blinded by her majesty
ferdinand what zeal what fury hath inspired thee now
 my love her mistress is a gracious moon
 she an attending star scarce seen a light
biron my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron
 o but for my love day would turn to night
 of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
 do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
 where several worthies make one dignity
 where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
 lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues
 fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not
 to things of sale a seller's praise belongs
 she passes praise then praise too short doth blot
 a wither'd hermit fivescore winters worn
 might shake off fifty looking in her eye
 beauty doth varnish age as if newborn
 and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy
 o tis the sun that maketh all things shine
ferdinand by heaven thy love is black as ebony
biron is ebony like her o wood divine
 a wife of such wood were felicity
 o who can give an oath where is a book
 that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack
 if that she learn not of her eye to look
 no face is fair that is not full so black
ferdinand o paradox black is the badge of hell
 the hue of dungeons and the suit of night
 and beauty's crest becomes the heavens well
biron devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
 o if in black my lady's brows be deck'd
 it mourns that painting and usurping hair
 should ravish doters with a false aspect
 and therefore is she born to make black fair
 her favour turns the fashion of the days
 for native blood is counted painting now
 and therefore red that would avoid dispraise
 paints itself black to imitate her brow
dumain to look like her are chimneysweepers black
longaville and since her time are colliers counted bright
ferdinand and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack
dumain dark needs no candles now for dark is light
biron your mistresses dare never come in rain
 for fear their colours should be wash'd away
ferdinand twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
 i'll find a fairer face not wash'd today
biron i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here
ferdinand no devil will fright thee then so much as she
dumain i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
longaville look here's thy love my foot and her face see
biron o if the streets were paved with thine eyes
 her feet were much too dainty for such tread
dumain o vile then as she goes what upward lies
 the street should see as she walk'd overhead
ferdinand but what of this are we not all in love
biron nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn
ferdinand then leave this chat and good biron now prove
 our loving lawful and our faith not torn
dumain ay marry there some flattery for this evil
longaville o some authority how to proceed
 some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
dumain some salve for perjury
biron tis more than need
 have at you then affection's men at arms
 consider what you first did swear unto
 to fast to study and to see no woman
 flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth
 say can you fast your stomachs are too young
 and abstinence engenders maladies
 and where that you have vow'd to study lords
 in that each of you have forsworn his book
 can you still dream and pore and thereon look
 for when would you my lord or you or you
 have found the ground of study's excellence
 without the beauty of a woman's face
 from women's eyes this doctrine i derive
 they are the ground the books the academes
 from whence doth spring the true promethean fire
 why universal plodding poisons up
 the nimble spirits in the arteries
 as motion and longduring action tires
 the sinewy vigour of the traveller
 now for not looking on a woman's face
 you have in that forsworn the use of eyes
 and study too the causer of your vow
 for where is any author in the world
 teaches such beauty as a woman's eye
 learning is but an adjunct to ourself
 and where we are our learning likewise is
 then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes
 do we not likewise see our learning there
 o we have made a vow to study lords
 and in that vow we have forsworn our books
 for when would you my liege or you or you
 in leaden contemplation have found out
 such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
 of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with
 other slow arts entirely keep the brain
 and therefore finding barren practisers
 scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
 but love first learned in a lady's eyes
 lives not alone immured in the brain
 but with the motion of all elements
 courses as swift as thought in every power
 and gives to every power a double power
 above their functions and their offices
 it adds a precious seeing to the eye
 a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind
 a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound
 when the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd
 love's feeling is more soft and sensible
 than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails
 love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste
 for valour is not love a hercules
 still climbing trees in the hesperides
 subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical
 as bright apollo's lute strung with his hair
 and when love speaks the voice of all the gods
 makes heaven drowsy with the harmony
 never durst poet touch a pen to write
 until his ink were temper'd with love's sighs
 o then his lines would ravish savage ears
 and plant in tyrants mild humility
 from women's eyes this doctrine i derive
 they sparkle still the right promethean fire
 they are the books the arts the academes
 that show contain and nourish all the world
 else none at all in ought proves excellent
 then fools you were these women to forswear
 or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
 for wisdom's sake a word that all men love
 or for love's sake a word that loves all men
 or for men's sake the authors of these women
 or women's sake by whom we men are men
 let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
 or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
 it is religion to be thus forsworn
 for charity itself fulfills the law
 and who can sever love from charity
ferdinand saint cupid then and soldiers to the field
biron advance your standards and upon them lords
 pellmell down with them but be first advised
 in conflict that you get the sun of them
longaville now to plaindealing lay these glozes by
 shall we resolve to woo these girls of france
ferdinand and win them too therefore let us devise
 some entertainment for them in their tents
biron first from the park let us conduct them thither
 then homeward every man attach the hand
 of his fair mistress in the afternoon
 we will with some strange pastime solace them
 such as the shortness of the time can shape
 for revels dances masks and merry hours
 forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers
ferdinand away away no time shall be omitted
 that will betime and may by us be fitted
biron allons allons sow'd cockle reap'd no corn
 and justice always whirls in equal measure
 light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
 if so our copper buys no better treasure

 love's labours lost
act v
scene ii the same
 enter the princess katharine rosaline and maria
princess sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart
 if fairings come thus plentifully in
 a lady wall'd about with diamonds
 look you what i have from the loving king
rosaline madame came nothing else along with that
princess nothing but this yes as much love in rhyme
 as would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper
 writ o both sides the leaf margent and all
 that he was fain to seal on cupid's name
rosaline that was the way to make his godhead wax
 for he hath been five thousand years a boy
katharine ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too
rosaline you'll ne'er be friends with him a kill'd your sister
katharine he made her melancholy sad and heavy
 and so she died had she been light like you
 of such a merry nimble stirring spirit
 she might ha been a grandam ere she died
 and so may you for a light heart lives long
rosaline what's your dark meaning mouse of this light word
katharine a light condition in a beauty dark
rosaline we need more light to find your meaning out
katharine you'll mar the light by taking it in snuff
 therefore i'll darkly end the argument
rosaline look what you do you do it still i the dark
katharine so do not you for you are a light wench
rosaline indeed i weigh not you and therefore light
katharine you weigh me not o that's you care not for me
rosaline great reason for past cure is still past care'
princess well bandied both a set of wit well play'd
 but rosaline you have a favour too
 who sent it and what is it
rosaline i would you knew
 an if my face were but as fair as yours
 my favour were as great be witness this
 nay i have verses too i thank biron
 the numbers true and were the numbering too
 i were the fairest goddess on the ground
 i am compared to twenty thousand fairs
 o he hath drawn my picture in his letter
princess any thing like
rosaline much in the letters nothing in the praise
princess beauteous as ink a good conclusion
katharine fair as a text b in a copybook
rosaline ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor
 my red dominical my golden letter
 o that your face were not so full of o's
katharine a pox of that jest and i beshrew all shrows
princess but katharine what was sent to you from fair dumain
katharine madam this glove
princess did he not send you twain
katharine yes madam and moreover
 some thousand verses of a faithful lover
 a huge translation of hypocrisy
 vilely compiled profound simplicity
maria this and these pearls to me sent longaville
 the letter is too long by half a mile
princess i think no less dost thou not wish in heart
 the chain were longer and the letter short
maria ay or i would these hands might never part
princess we are wise girls to mock our lovers so
rosaline they are worse fools to purchase mocking so
 that same biron i'll torture ere i go
 o that i knew he were but in by the week
 how i would make him fawn and beg and seek
 and wait the season and observe the times
 and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
 and shape his service wholly to my hests
 and make him proud to make me proud that jests
 so perttauntlike would i o'ersway his state
 that he should be my fool and i his fate
princess none are so surely caught when they are catch'd
 as wit turn'd fool folly in wisdom hatch'd
 hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
 and wit's own grace to grace a learned fool
rosaline the blood of youth burns not with such excess
 as gravity's revolt to wantonness
maria folly in fools bears not so strong a note
 as foolery in the wise when wit doth dote
 since all the power thereof it doth apply
 to prove by wit worth in simplicity
princess here comes boyet and mirth is in his face
 enter boyet
boyet o i am stabb'd with laughter where's her grace
princess thy news boyet
boyet prepare madam prepare
 arm wenches arm encounters mounted are
 against your peace love doth approach disguised
 armed in arguments you'll be surprised
 muster your wits stand in your own defence
 or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence
princess saint denis to saint cupid what are they
 that charge their breath against us say scout say
boyet under the cool shade of a sycamore
 i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
 when lo to interrupt my purposed rest
 toward that shade i might behold addrest
 the king and his companions warily
 i stole into a neighbour thicket by
 and overheard what you shall overhear
 that by and by disguised they will be here
 their herald is a pretty knavish page
 that well by heart hath conn'd his embassage
 action and accent did they teach him there
 thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear'
 and ever and anon they made a doubt
 presence majestical would put him out
 for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see
 yet fear not thou but speak audaciously'
 the boy replied an angel is not evil
 i should have fear'd her had she been a devil'
 with that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder
 making the bold wag by their praises bolder
 one rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore
 a better speech was never spoke before
 another with his finger and his thumb
 cried via we will do't come what will come'
 the third he caper'd and cried all goes well'
 the fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell
 with that they all did tumble on the ground
 with such a zealous laughter so profound
 that in this spleen ridiculous appears
 to cheque their folly passion's solemn tears
princess but what but what come they to visit us
boyet they do they do and are apparell'd thus
 like muscovites or russians as i guess
 their purpose is to parle to court and dance
 and every one his lovefeat will advance
 unto his several mistress which they'll know
 by favours several which they did bestow
princess and will they so the gallants shall be task'd
 for ladies we shall every one be mask'd
 and not a man of them shall have the grace
 despite of suit to see a lady's face
 hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear
 and then the king will court thee for his dear
 hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
 so shall biron take me for rosaline
 and change your favours too so shall your loves
 woo contrary deceived by these removes
rosaline come on then wear the favours most in sight
katharine but in this changing what is your intent
princess the effect of my intent is to cross theirs
 they do it but in mocking merriment
 and mock for mock is only my intent
 their several counsels they unbosom shall
 to loves mistook and so be mock'd withal
 upon the next occasion that we meet
 with visages displayed to talk and greet
rosaline but shall we dance if they desire to't
princess no to the death we will not move a foot
 nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace
 but while tis spoke each turn away her face
boyet why that contempt will kill the speaker's heart
 and quite divorce his memory from his part
princess therefore i do it and i make no doubt
 the rest will ne'er come in if he be out
 there's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown
 to make theirs ours and ours none but our own
 so shall we stay mocking intended game
 and they well mock'd depart away with shame
 trumpets sound within
boyet the trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers come
 the ladies mask
 enter blackamoors with music moth ferdinand
 biron longaville and dumain in russian habits
 and masked
moth all hail the richest beauties on the earth
boyet beauties no richer than rich taffeta
moth a holy parcel of the fairest dames
 the ladies turn their backs to him
 that ever turn'd theirbacksto mortal views
biron aside to moth their eyes villain their eyes
moth that ever turn'd their eyes to mortal viewsout
boyet true out indeed
moth out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe
 not to behold
biron aside to moth once to behold rogue
moth once to behold with your sunbeamed eyes
 with your sunbeamed eyes
boyet they will not answer to that epithet
 you were best call it daughterbeamed eyes'
moth they do not mark me and that brings me out
biron is this your perfectness be gone you rogue
 exit moth
rosaline what would these strangers know their minds boyet
 if they do speak our language tis our will
 that some plain man recount their purposes
 know what they would
boyet what would you with the princess
biron nothing but peace and gentle visitation
rosaline what would they say they
boyet nothing but peace and gentle visitation
rosaline why that they have and bid them so be gone
boyet she says you have it and you may be gone
ferdinand say to her we have measured many miles
 to tread a measure with her on this grass
boyet they say that they have measured many a mile
 to tread a measure with you on this grass
rosaline it is not so ask them how many inches
 is in one mile if they have measured many
 the measure then of one is easily told
boyet if to come hither you have measured miles
 and many miles the princess bids you tell
 how many inches doth fill up one mile
biron tell her we measure them by weary steps
boyet she hears herself
rosaline how many weary steps
 of many weary miles you have o'ergone
 are number'd in the travel of one mile
biron we number nothing that we spend for you
 our duty is so rich so infinite
 that we may do it still without accompt
 vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
 that we like savages may worship it
rosaline my face is but a moon and clouded too
ferdinand blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do
 vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
 those clouds removed upon our watery eyne
rosaline o vain petitioner beg a greater matter
 thou now request'st but moonshine in the water
ferdinand then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change
 thou bid'st me beg this begging is not strange
rosaline play music then nay you must do it soon
 music plays
 not yet no dance thus change i like the moon
ferdinand will you not dance how come you thus estranged
rosaline you took the moon at full but now she's changed
ferdinand yet still she is the moon and i the man
 the music plays vouchsafe some motion to it
rosaline our ears vouchsafe it
ferdinand but your legs should do it
rosaline since you are strangers and come here by chance
 we'll not be nice take hands we will not dance
ferdinand why take we hands then
rosaline only to part friends
 curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends
ferdinand more measure of this measure be not nice
rosaline we can afford no more at such a price
ferdinand prize you yourselves what buys your company
rosaline your absence only
ferdinand that can never be
rosaline then cannot we be bought and so adieu
 twice to your visor and half once to you
ferdinand if you deny to dance let's hold more chat
rosaline in private then
ferdinand i am best pleased with that
 they converse apart
biron whitehanded mistress one sweet word with thee
princess honey and milk and sugar there is three
biron nay then two treys and if you grow so nice
 metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice
 there's halfadozen sweets
princess seventh sweet adieu
 since you can cog i'll play no more with you
biron one word in secret
princess let it not be sweet
biron thou grievest my gall
princess gall bitter

 they converse apart
dumain will you vouchsafe with me to change a word
maria name it
dumain fair lady
maria say you so fair lord
 take that for your fair lady
dumain please it you
 as much in private and i'll bid adieu
 they converse apart
katharine what was your vizard made without a tongue
longaville i know the reason lady why you ask
katharine o for your reason quickly sir i long
longaville you have a double tongue within your mask
 and would afford my speechless vizard half
katharine veal quoth the dutchman is not veal a calf
longaville a calf fair lady

longaville look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks
 will you give horns chaste lady do not so
katharine then die a calf before your horns do grow
longaville one word in private with you ere i die
katharine bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry
 they converse apart
boyet the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
 as is the razor's edge invisible
 cutting a smaller hair than may be seen
 above the sense of sense so sensible
 seemeth their conference their conceits have wings
 fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things
rosaline not one word more my maids break off break off
biron by heaven all drybeaten with pure scoff
ferdinand farewell mad wenches you have simple wits
princess twenty adieus my frozen muscovits
 exeunt ferdinand lords and blackamoors
 are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at
boyet tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff'd out
rosaline wellliking wits they have gross gross fat fat
princess o poverty in wit kinglypoor flout
 will they not think you hang themselves tonight
 or ever but in vizards show their faces
 this pert biron was out of countenance quite
rosaline o they were all in lamentable cases
 the king was weepingripe for a good word
princess biron did swear himself out of all suit
maria dumain was at my service and his sword
 no point quoth i my servant straight was mute
katharine lord longaville said i came o'er his heart
 and trow you what he called me
princess qualm perhaps
katharine yes in good faith
princess go sickness as thou art
rosaline well better wits have worn plain statutecaps
 but will you hear the king is my love sworn
princess and quick biron hath plighted faith to me
katharine and longaville was for my service born
maria dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree
boyet madam and pretty mistresses give ear
 immediately they will again be here
 in their own shapes for it can never be
 they will digest this harsh indignity
princess will they return
boyet they will they will god knows
 and leap for joy though they are lame with blows
 therefore change favours and when they repair
 blow like sweet roses in this summer air
princess how blow how blow speak to be understood
boyet fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud
 dismask'd their damask sweet commixture shown
 are angels vailing clouds or roses blown
princess avaunt perplexity what shall we do
 if they return in their own shapes to woo
rosaline good madam if by me you'll be advised
 let's mock them still as well known as disguised
 let us complain to them what fools were here
 disguised like muscovites in shapeless gear
 and wonder what they were and to what end
 their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
 and their rough carriage so ridiculous
 should be presented at our tent to us
boyet ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand
princess whip to our tents as roes run o'er land
 exeunt princess rosaline katharine and maria
 reenter ferdinand biron longaville and dumain
 in their proper habits
ferdinand fair sir god save you where's the princess
boyet gone to her tent please it your majesty
 command me any service to her thither
ferdinand that she vouchsafe me audience for one word
boyet i will and so will she i know my lord
 exit
biron this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease
 and utters it again when god doth please
 he is wit's pedler and retails his wares
 at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs
 and we that sell by gross the lord doth know
 have not the grace to grace it with such show
 this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve
 had he been adam he had tempted eve
 a can carve too and lisp why this is he
 that kiss'd his hand away in courtesy
 this is the ape of form monsieur the nice
 that when he plays at tables chides the dice
 in honourable terms nay he can sing
 a mean most meanly and in ushering
 mend him who can the ladies call him sweet
 the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet
 this is the flower that smiles on every one
 to show his teeth as white as whale's bone
 and consciences that will not die in debt
 pay him the due of honeytongued boyet
ferdinand a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart
 that put armado's page out of his part
biron see where it comes behavior what wert thou
 till this madman show'd thee and what art thou now
 reenter the princess ushered by boyet rosaline
 maria and katharine
ferdinand all hail sweet madam and fair time of day
princess fair in all hail is foul as i conceive
ferdinand construe my speeches better if you may
princess then wish me better i will give you leave
ferdinand we came to visit you and purpose now
 to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then
princess this field shall hold me and so hold your vow
 nor god nor i delights in perjured men
ferdinand rebuke me not for that which you provoke
 the virtue of your eye must break my oath
princess you nickname virtue vice you should have spoke
 for virtue's office never breaks men's troth
 now by my maiden honour yet as pure
 as the unsullied lily i protest
 a world of torments though i should endure
 i would not yield to be your house's guest
 so much i hate a breaking cause to be
 of heavenly oaths vow'd with integrity
ferdinand o you have lived in desolation here
 unseen unvisited much to our shame
princess not so my lord it is not so i swear
 we have had pastimes here and pleasant game
 a mess of russians left us but of late
ferdinand how madam russians
princess ay in truth my lord
 trim gallants full of courtship and of state
rosaline madam speak true it is not so my lord
 my lady to the manner of the days
 in courtesy gives undeserving praise
 we four indeed confronted were with four
 in russian habit here they stay'd an hour
 and talk'd apace and in that hour my lord
 they did not bless us with one happy word
 i dare not call them fools but this i think
 when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink
biron this jest is dry to me fair gentle sweet
 your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet
 with eyes best seeing heaven's fiery eye
 by light we lose light your capacity
 is of that nature that to your huge store
 wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor
rosaline this proves you wise and rich for in my eye
biron i am a fool and full of poverty
rosaline but that you take what doth to you belong
 it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue
biron o i am yours and all that i possess
rosaline all the fool mine
biron i cannot give you less
rosaline which of the vizards was it that you wore
biron where when what vizard why demand you this
rosaline there then that vizard that superfluous case
 that hid the worse and show'd the better face
ferdinand we are descried they'll mock us now downright
dumain let us confess and turn it to a jest
princess amazed my lord why looks your highness sad
rosaline help hold his brows he'll swoon why look you pale
 seasick i think coming from muscovy
biron thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
 can any face of brass hold longer out
 here stand i lady dart thy skill at me
 bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout
 thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance
 cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit
 and i will wish thee never more to dance
 nor never more in russian habit wait
 o never will i trust to speeches penn'd
 nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue
 nor never come in vizard to my friend
 nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper's song
 taffeta phrases silken terms precise
 threepiled hyperboles spruce affectation
 figures pedantical these summerflies
 have blown me full of maggot ostentation
 i do forswear them and i here protest
 by this white glovehow white the hand god knows
 henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
 in russet yeas and honest kersey noes
 and to begin wenchso god help me la
 my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw
rosaline sans sans i pray you
biron yet i have a trick
 of the old rage bear with me i am sick
 i'll leave it by degrees soft let us see
 write lord have mercy on us on those three
 they are infected in their hearts it lies
 they have the plague and caught it of your eyes
 these lords are visited you are not free
 for the lord's tokens on you do i see
princess no they are free that gave these tokens to us
biron our states are forfeit seek not to undo us
rosaline it is not so for how can this be true
 that you stand forfeit being those that sue
biron peace for i will not have to do with you
rosaline nor shall not if i do as i intend
biron speak for yourselves my wit is at an end
ferdinand teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression
 some fair excuse
princess the fairest is confession
 were not you here but even now disguised
ferdinand madam i was
princess and were you well advised
ferdinand i was fair madam
princess when you then were here
 what did you whisper in your lady's ear
ferdinand that more than all the world i did respect her
princess when she shall challenge this you will reject her
ferdinand upon mine honour no
princess peace peace forbear
 your oath once broke you force not to forswear
ferdinand despise me when i break this oath of mine
princess i will and therefore keep it rosaline
 what did the russian whisper in your ear
rosaline madam he swore that he did hold me dear
 as precious eyesight and did value me
 above this world adding thereto moreover
 that he would wed me or else die my lover
princess god give thee joy of him the noble lord
 most honourably doth unhold his word
ferdinand what mean you madam by my life my troth
 i never swore this lady such an oath
rosaline by heaven you did and to confirm it plain
 you gave me this but take it sir again
ferdinand my faith and this the princess i did give
 i knew her by this jewel on her sleeve
princess pardon me sir this jewel did she wear
 and lord biron i thank him is my dear
 what will you have me or your pearl again
biron neither of either i remit both twain
 i see the trick on't here was a consent
 knowing aforehand of our merriment
 to dash it like a christmas comedy
 some carrytale some pleaseman some slight zany
 some mumblenews some trencherknight some dick
 that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
 to make my lady laugh when she's disposed
 told our intents before which once disclosed
 the ladies did change favours and then we
 following the signs woo'd but the sign of she
 now to our perjury to add more terror
 we are again forsworn in will and error
 much upon this it is and might not you
 to boyet
 forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
 do not you know my lady's foot by the squier
 and laugh upon the apple of her eye
 and stand between her back sir and the fire
 holding a trencher jesting merrily
 you put our page out go you are allow'd
 die when you will a smock shall be your shroud
 you leer upon me do you there's an eye
 wounds like a leaden sword
boyet full merrily
 hath this brave manage this career been run
biron lo he is tilting straight peace i have done

 enter mercade
mercade god save you madam
princess welcome mercade
 but that thou interrupt'st our merriment
mercade i am sorry madam for the news i bring
 is heavy in my tongue the king your father
princess dead for my life
mercade even so my tale is told
biron worthies away the scene begins to cloud
don
adriano de armado for mine own part i breathe free breath i have
 seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
 discretion and i will right myself like a soldier
 exeunt worthies
ferdinand how fares your majesty
princess boyet prepare i will away tonight
ferdinand madam not so i do beseech you stay
princess prepare i say i thank you gracious lords
 for all your fair endeavors and entreat
 out of a newsad soul that you vouchsafe
 in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
 the liberal opposition of our spirits
 if overboldly we have borne ourselves
 in the converse of breath your gentleness
 was guilty of it farewell worthy lord
 a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
 excuse me so coming too short of thanks
 for my great suit so easily obtain'd
ferdinand the extreme parts of time extremely forms
 all causes to the purpose of his speed
 and often at his very loose decides
 that which long process could not arbitrate
 and though the mourning brow of progeny
 forbid the smiling courtesy of love
 the holy suit which fain it would convince
 yet since love's argument was first on foot
 let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
 from what it purposed since to wail friends lost
 is not by much so wholesomeprofitable
 as to rejoice at friends but newly found
princess i understand you not my griefs are double
biron honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
 and by these badges understand the king
 for your fair sakes have we neglected time
 play'd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies
 hath much deform'd us fashioning our humours
 even to the opposed end of our intents
 and what in us hath seem'd ridiculous
 as love is full of unbefitting strains
 all wanton as a child skipping and vain
 form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye
 full of strange shapes of habits and of forms
 varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
 to every varied object in his glance
 which particoated presence of loose love
 put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
 have misbecomed our oaths and gravities
 those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
 suggested us to make therefore ladies
 our love being yours the error that love makes
 is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false
 by being once false for ever to be true
 to those that make us bothfair ladies you
 and even that falsehood in itself a sin
 thus purifies itself and turns to grace
princess we have received your letters full of love
 your favours the ambassadors of love
 and in our maiden council rated them
 at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
 as bombast and as lining to the time
 but more devout than this in our respects
 have we not been and therefore met your loves
 in their own fashion like a merriment
dumain our letters madam show'd much more than jest
longaville so did our looks
rosaline we did not quote them so
ferdinand now at the latest minute of the hour
 grant us your loves
princess a time methinks too short
 to make a worldwithoutend bargain in
 no no my lord your grace is perjured much
 full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
 if for my love as there is no such cause
 you will do aught this shall you do for me
 your oath i will not trust but go with speed
 to some forlorn and naked hermitage
 remote from all the pleasures of the world
 there stay until the twelve celestial signs
 have brought about the annual reckoning
 if this austere insociable life
 change not your offer made in heat of blood
 if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
 nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
 but that it bear this trial and last love
 then at the expiration of the year
 come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
 and by this virgin palm now kissing thine
 i will be thine and till that instant shut
 my woeful self up in a mourning house
 raining the tears of lamentation
 for the remembrance of my father's death
 if this thou do deny let our hands part
 neither entitled in the other's heart
ferdinand if this or more than this i would deny
 to flatter up these powers of mine with rest
 the sudden hand of death close up mine eye
 hence ever then my heart is in thy breast
biron and what to me my love and what to me
rosaline you must be purged too your sins are rack'd
 you are attaint with faults and perjury
 therefore if you my favour mean to get
 a twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest
 but seek the weary beds of people sick
dumain but what to me my love but what to me a wife
katharine a beard fair health and honesty
 with threefold love i wish you all these three
dumain o shall i say i thank you gentle wife
katharine not so my lord a twelvemonth and a day
 i'll mark no words that smoothfaced wooers say
 come when the king doth to my lady come
 then if i have much love i'll give you some
dumain i'll serve thee true and faithfully till then
katharine yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again
longaville what says maria
maria at the twelvemonth's end
 i'll change my black gown for a faithful friend
longaville i'll stay with patience but the time is long
maria the liker you few taller are so young
biron studies my lady mistress look on me
 behold the window of my heart mine eye
 what humble suit attends thy answer there
 impose some service on me for thy love
rosaline oft have i heard of you my lord biron
 before i saw you and the world's large tongue
 proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
 full of comparisons and wounding flouts
 which you on all estates will execute
 that lie within the mercy of your wit
 to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
 and therewithal to win me if you please
 without the which i am not to be won
 you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
 visit the speechless sick and still converse
 with groaning wretches and your task shall be
 with all the fierce endeavor of your wit
 to enforce the pained impotent to smile
biron to move wild laughter in the throat of death
 it cannot be it is impossible
 mirth cannot move a soul in agony
rosaline why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit
 whose influence is begot of that loose grace
 which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
 a jest's prosperity lies in the ear
 of him that hears it never in the tongue
 of him that makes it then if sickly ears
 deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans
 will hear your idle scorns continue then
 and i will have you and that fault withal
 but if they will not throw away that spirit
 and i shall find you empty of that fault
 right joyful of your reformation
biron a twelvemonth well befall what will befall
 i'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital
princess to ferdinand ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave
ferdinand no madam we will bring you on your way
biron our wooing doth not end like an old play
 jack hath not jill these ladies courtesy
 might well have made our sport a comedy
ferdinand come sir it wants a twelvemonth and a day
 and then twill end
biron that's too long for a play

 the cuckoo then on every tree
 mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo
 cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear
 unpleasing to a married ear
 when shepherds pipe on oaten straws
 and merry larks are ploughmen's clocks
 when turtles tread and rooks and daws
 and maidens bleach their summer smocks
 the cuckoo then on every tree
 mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo
 cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear
 unpleasing to a married ear
 
 winter
 when icicles hang by the wall
 and dick the shepherd blows his nail
 and tom bears logs into the hall
 and milk comes frozen home in pail
 when blood is nipp'd and ways be foul
 then nightly sings the staring owl tuwhit

 while greasy joan doth keel the pot
 when all aloud the wind doth blow
 and coughing drowns the parson's saw
 and birds sit brooding in the snow
 and marian's nose looks red and raw
 when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl

 and given his deputation all the organs
 of our own power what think you of it
escalus if any in vienna be of worth
 to undergo such ample grace and honour
 it is lord angelo
duke vincentio look where he comes
 enter angelo
angelo always obedient to your grace's will
 i come to know your pleasure
duke vincentio angelo
 there is a kind of character in thy life
 that to the observer doth thy history
 fully unfold thyself and thy belongings
 are not thine own so proper as to waste
 thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
 heaven doth with us as we with torches do
 not light them for themselves for if our virtues
 did not go forth of us twere all alike
 as if we had them not spirits are not finely touch'd
 but to fine issues nor nature never lends
 the smallest scruple of her excellence
 but like a thrifty goddess she determines
 herself the glory of a creditor
 both thanks and use but i do bend my speech
 to one that can my part in him advertise
 hold therefore angelo
 in our remove be thou at full ourself
 mortality and mercy in vienna
 live in thy tongue and heart old escalus
 though first in question is thy secondary
 take thy commission
angelo now good my lord
 let there be some more test made of my metal
 before so noble and so great a figure
 be stamp'd upon it
duke vincentio no more evasion
 we have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
 proceeded to you therefore take your honours
 our haste from hence is of so quick condition
 that it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
 matters of needful value we shall write to you
 as time and our concernings shall importune
 how it goes with us and do look to know
 what doth befall you here so fare you well
 to the hopeful execution do i leave you
 of your commissions
angelo yet give leave my lord
 that we may bring you something on the way
duke vincentio my haste may not admit it
 nor need you on mine honour have to do
 with any scruple your scope is as mine own
 so to enforce or qualify the laws
 as to your soul seems good give me your hand
 i'll privily away i love the people
 but do not like to stage me to their eyes
 through it do well i do not relish well
 their loud applause and aves vehement
 nor do i think the man of safe discretion
 that does affect it once more fare you well
angelo the heavens give safety to your purposes
escalus lead forth and bring you back in happiness
duke i thank you fare you well
 exit
escalus i shall desire you sir to give me leave
 to have free speech with you and it concerns me
 to look into the bottom of my place
 a power i have but of what strength and nature
 i am not yet instructed
angelo tis so with me let us withdraw together
 and we may soon our satisfaction have
 touching that point
escalus i'll wait upon your honour

scene ii a street
 enter lucio and two gentlemen
lucio if the duke with the other dukes come not to
 composition with the king of hungary why then all
 the dukes fall upon the king
first gentleman heaven grant us its peace but not the king of
 hungary's
second gentleman amen
lucio thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that
 went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped
 one out of the table
second gentleman thou shalt not steal'
lucio ay that he razed
first gentleman why twas a commandment to command the captain and
 all the rest from their functions they put forth
 to steal there's not a soldier of us all that in
 the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition
 well that prays for peace
second gentleman i never heard any soldier dislike it
lucio i believe thee for i think thou never wast where
 grace was said
second gentleman no a dozen times at least
first gentleman what in metre
lucio in any proportion or in any language
first gentleman i think or in any religion
lucio ay why not grace is grace despite of all
 controversy as for example thou thyself art a
 wicked villain despite of all grace
first gentleman well there went but a pair of shears between us
lucio i grant as there may between the lists and the
 velvet thou art the list
first gentleman and thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou'rt
 a threepiled piece i warrant thee i had as lief
 be a list of an english kersey as be piled as thou
 art piled for a french velvet do i speak
 feelingly now
lucio i think thou dost and indeed with most painful
 feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own
 confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i
 live forget to drink after thee
first gentleman i think i have done myself wrong have i not
second gentleman yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free
lucio behold behold where madam mitigation comes i
 have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to
second gentleman to what i pray
lucio judge
second gentleman to three thousand dolours a year
first gentleman ay and more
lucio a french crown more
first gentleman thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou
 art full of error i am sound
lucio nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as
 things that are hollow thy bones are hollow
 impiety has made a feast of thee
 enter mistress overdone
first gentleman how now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica
mistress overdone well well there's one yonder arrested and carried
 to prison was worth five thousand of you all
second gentleman who's that i pray thee
mistress overdone marry sir that's claudio signior claudio
first gentleman claudio to prison tis not so
mistress overdone nay but i know tis so i saw him arrested saw
 him carried away and which is more within these
 three days his head to be chopped off
lucio but after all this fooling i would not have it so
 art thou sure of this
mistress overdone i am too sure of it and it is for getting madam
 julietta with child
lucio believe me this may be he promised to meet me two
 hours since and he was ever precise in
 promisekeeping
second gentleman besides you know it draws something near to the
 speech we had to such a purpose
first gentleman but most of all agreeing with the proclamation
lucio away let's go learn the truth of it
 exeunt lucio and gentlemen
mistress overdone thus what with the war what with the sweat what
 with the gallows and what with poverty i am
 customshrunk
 enter pompey
 how now what's the news with you
pompey yonder man is carried to prison
mistress overdone well what has he done
pompey a woman
mistress overdone but what's his offence
pompey groping for trouts in a peculiar river
mistress overdone what is there a maid with child by him
pompey no but there's a woman with maid by him you have
 not heard of the proclamation have you
mistress overdone what proclamation man
pompey all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down
mistress overdone and what shall become of those in the city
pompey they shall stand for seed they had gone down too
 but that a wise burgher put in for them
mistress overdone but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
 pulled down
pompey to the ground mistress
mistress overdone why here's a change indeed in the commonwealth
 what shall become of me
pompey come fear you not good counsellors lack no
 clients though you change your place you need not
 change your trade i'll be your tapster still
 courage there will be pity taken on you you that
 have worn your eyes almost out in the service you
 will be considered
mistress overdone what's to do here thomas tapster let's withdraw
pompey here comes signior claudio led by the provost to
 prison and there's madam juliet
 exeunt
 enter provost claudio juliet and officers
claudio fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world
 bear me to prison where i am committed
provost i do it not in evil disposition
 but from lord angelo by special charge
claudio thus can the demigod authority
 make us pay down for our offence by weight
 the words of heaven on whom it will it will
 on whom it will not so yet still tis just
 reenter lucio and two gentlemen
lucio why how now claudio whence comes this restraint
claudio from too much liberty my lucio liberty
 as surfeit is the father of much fast
 so every scope by the immoderate use
 turns to restraint our natures do pursue
 like rats that ravin down their proper bane
 a thirsty evil and when we drink we die
lucio if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would
 send for certain of my creditors and yet to say
 the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom
 as the morality of imprisonment what's thy
 offence claudio
claudio what but to speak of would offend again
lucio what is't murder
claudio no
lucio lechery
claudio call it so
provost away sir you must go
claudio one word good friend lucio a word with you
lucio a hundred if they'll do you any good
 is lechery so look'd after
claudio thus stands it with me upon a true contract
 i got possession of julietta's bed
 you know the lady she is fast my wife
 save that we do the denunciation lack
 of outward order this we came not to
 only for propagation of a dower
 remaining in the coffer of her friends
 from whom we thought it meet to hide our love
 till time had made them for us but it chances
 the stealth of our most mutual entertainment
 with character too gross is writ on juliet
lucio with child perhaps
claudio unhappily even so
 and the new deputy now for the duke
 whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
 or whether that the body public be
 a horse whereon the governor doth ride
 who newly in the seat that it may know
 he can command lets it straight feel the spur
 whether the tyranny be in his place
 or in his emmence that fills it up
 i stagger inbut this new governor
 awakes me all the enrolled penalties
 which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall
 so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
 and none of them been worn and for a name
 now puts the drowsy and neglected act
 freshly on me tis surely for a name
lucio i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on
 thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love
 may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to
 him
claudio i have done so but he's not to be found
 i prithee lucio do me this kind service
 this day my sister should the cloister enter
 and there receive her approbation
 acquaint her with the danger of my state
 implore her in my voice that she make friends
 to the strict deputy bid herself assay him
 i have great hope in that for in her youth
 there is a prone and speechless dialect
 such as move men beside she hath prosperous art
 when she will play with reason and discourse
 and well she can persuade
lucio i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the
 like which else would stand under grievous
 imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i
 would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
 game of ticktack i'll to her
claudio i thank you good friend lucio
lucio within two hours
claudio come officer away

scene iii a monastery
 enter duke vincentio and friar thomas
duke vincentio no holy father throw away that thought
 believe not that the dribbling dart of love
 can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee
 to give me secret harbour hath a purpose
 more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
 of burning youth
friar thomas may your grace speak of it
duke vincentio my holy sir none better knows than you
 how i have ever loved the life removed
 and held in idle price to haunt assemblies
 where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps
 i have deliver'd to lord angelo
 a man of stricture and firm abstinence
 my absolute power and place here in vienna
 and he supposes me travell'd to poland
 for so i have strew'd it in the common ear
 and so it is received now pious sir
 you will demand of me why i do this
friar thomas gladly my lord
duke vincentio we have strict statutes and most biting laws
 the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds
 which for this nineteen years we have let slip
 even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave
 that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers
 having bound up the threatening twigs of birch
 only to stick it in their children's sight
 for terror not to use in time the rod
 becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees
 dead to infliction to themselves are dead
 and liberty plucks justice by the nose
 the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
 goes all decorum
friar thomas it rested in your grace
 to unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased
 and it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
 than in lord angelo
duke vincentio i do fear too dreadful
 sith twas my fault to give the people scope
 twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
 for what i bid them do for we bid this be done
 when evil deeds have their permissive pass
 and not the punishment therefore indeed my father
 i have on angelo imposed the office
 who may in the ambush of my name strike home
 and yet my nature never in the fight
 to do in slander and to behold his sway
 i will as twere a brother of your order
 visit both prince and people therefore i prithee
 supply me with the habit and instruct me
 how i may formally in person bear me
 like a true friar more reasons for this action
 at our more leisure shall i render you
 only this one lord angelo is precise
 stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
 that his blood flows or that his appetite
 is more to bread than stone hence shall we see
 if power change purpose what our seemers be

scene iv a nunnery
 enter isabella and francisca
isabella and have you nuns no farther privileges
francisca are not these large enough
isabella yes truly i speak not as desiring more
 but rather wishing a more strict restraint
 upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare
lucio within ho peace be in this place
isabella who's that which calls
francisca it is a man's voice gentle isabella
 turn you the key and know his business of him
 you may i may not you are yet unsworn
 when you have vow'd you must not speak with men
 but in the presence of the prioress
 then if you speak you must not show your face
 or if you show your face you must not speak
 he calls again i pray you answer him
 exit
isabella peace and prosperity who is't that calls
 enter lucio
lucio hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses
 proclaim you are no less can you so stead me
 as bring me to the sight of isabella
 a novice of this place and the fair sister
 to her unhappy brother claudio
isabella why her unhappy brother let me ask
 the rather for i now must make you know
 i am that isabella and his sister
lucio gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
 not to be weary with you he's in prison
isabella woe me for what
lucio for that which if myself might be his judge
 he should receive his punishment in thanks
 he hath got his friend with child
isabella sir make me not your story
lucio it is true
 i would notthough tis my familiar sin
 with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
 tongue far from heartplay with all virgins so
 i hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted
 by your renouncement an immortal spirit
 and to be talk'd with in sincerity
 as with a saint
isabella you do blaspheme the good in mocking me
lucio do not believe it fewness and truth tis thus
 your brother and his lover have embraced
 as those that feed grow full as blossoming time
 that from the seedness the bare fallow brings
 to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
 expresseth his full tilth and husbandry
isabella some one with child by him my cousin juliet
lucio is she your cousin
isabella adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names
 by vain though apt affection
lucio she it is
isabella o let him marry her
lucio this is the point
 the duke is very strangely gone from hence
 bore many gentlemen myself being one
 in hand and hope of action but we do learn
 by those that know the very nerves of state
 his givingsout were of an infinite distance
 from his truemeant design upon his place
 and with full line of his authority
 governs lord angelo a man whose blood
 is very snowbroth one who never feels
 the wanton stings and motions of the sense
 but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
 with profits of the mind study and fast
 heto give fear to use and liberty
 which have for long run by the hideous law
 as mice by lionshath pick'd out an act
 under whose heavy sense your brother's life
 falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
 and follows close the rigour of the statute
 to make him an example all hope is gone
 unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
 to soften angelo and that's my pith of business
 twixt you and your poor brother
isabella doth he so seek his life
lucio has censured him
 already and as i hear the provost hath
 a warrant for his execution
isabella alas what poor ability's in me
 to do him good
lucio assay the power you have
isabella my power alas i doubt
lucio our doubts are traitors
 and make us lose the good we oft might win
 by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo
 and let him learn to know when maidens sue
 men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
 all their petitions are as freely theirs
 as they themselves would owe them
isabella i'll see what i can do
lucio but speedily
isabella i will about it straight
 no longer staying but to give the mother
 notice of my affair i humbly thank you
 commend me to my brother soon at night
 i'll send him certain word of my success
lucio i take my leave of you

scene i a hall in angelo's house
 enter angelo escalus and a justice provost
 officers and other attendants behind
angelo we must not make a scarecrow of the law
 setting it up to fear the birds of prey
 and let it keep one shape till custom make it
 their perch and not their terror
escalus ay but yet
 let us be keen and rather cut a little
 than fall and bruise to death alas this gentleman
 whom i would save had a most noble father
 let but your honour know
 whom i believe to be most strait in virtue
 that in the working of your own affections
 had time cohered with place or place with wishing
 or that the resolute acting of your blood
 could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose
 whether you had not sometime in your life
 err'd in this point which now you censure him
 and pull'd the law upon you
angelo tis one thing to be tempted escalus
 another thing to fall i not deny
 the jury passing on the prisoner's life
 may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
 guiltier than him they try what's open made to justice
 that justice seizes what know the laws
 that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant
 the jewel that we find we stoop and take't
 because we see it but what we do not see
 we tread upon and never think of it
 you may not so extenuate his offence
 for i have had such faults but rather tell me
 when i that censure him do so offend
 let mine own judgment pattern out my death
 and nothing come in partial sir he must die
escalus be it as your wisdom will

provost here if it like your honour
angelo see that claudio
 be executed by nine tomorrow morning

pompey sir if it please your honour this is not so

angelo well the matter
isabella i have a brother is condemn'd to die
 i do beseech you let it be his fault
 and not my brother
provost aside heaven give thee moving graces
angelo condemn the fault and not the actor of it
 why every fault's condemn'd ere it be done
 mine were the very cipher of a function
 to fine the faults whose fine stands in record
 and let go by the actor
isabella o just but severe law
 i had a brother then heaven keep your honour
lucio aside to isabella give't not o'er so to him
 again entreat him
 kneel down before him hang upon his gown
 you are too cold if you should need a pin
 you could not with more tame a tongue desire it
 to him i say
isabella must he needs die
angelo maiden no remedy
isabella yes i do think that you might pardon him
 and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy
angelo i will not do't
isabella but can you if you would
angelo look what i will not that i cannot do
isabella but might you do't and do the world no wrong
 if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
 as mine is to him
angelo he's sentenced tis too late
lucio aside to isabella you are too cold
isabella too late why no i that do speak a word
 may call it back again well believe this
 no ceremony that to great ones longs
 not the king's crown nor the deputed sword
 the marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe
 become them with one half so good a grace
 as mercy does
 if he had been as you and you as he
 you would have slipt like him but he like you
 would not have been so stern
angelo pray you be gone
isabella i would to heaven i had your potency
 and you were isabel should it then be thus
 no i would tell what twere to be a judge
 and what a prisoner
lucio aside to isabella
 ay touch him there's the vein
angelo your brother is a forfeit of the law
 and you but waste your words
isabella alas alas
 why all the souls that were were forfeit once
 and he that might the vantage best have took
 found out the remedy how would you be
 if he which is the top of judgment should
 but judge you as you are o think on that
 and mercy then will breathe within your lips
 like man new made
angelo be you content fair maid
 it is the law not i condemn your brother
 were he my kinsman brother or my son
 it should be thus with him he must die tomorrow
isabella tomorrow o that's sudden spare him spare him
 he's not prepared for death even for our kitchens
 we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
 with less respect than we do minister
 to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you
 who is it that hath died for this offence
 there's many have committed it
lucio aside to isabella ay well said
angelo the law hath not been dead though it hath slept
 those many had not dared to do that evil
 if the first that did the edict infringe
 had answer'd for his deed now tis awake
 takes note of what is done and like a prophet
 looks in a glass that shows what future evils
 either new or by remissness newconceived
 and so in progress to be hatch'd and born
 are now to have no successive degrees
 but ere they live to end
isabella yet show some pity
angelo i show it most of all when i show justice
 for then i pity those i do not know
 which a dismiss'd offence would after gall
 and do him right that answering one foul wrong
 lives not to act another be satisfied
 your brother dies tomorrow be content
isabella so you must be the first that gives this sentence
 and he that suffer's o it is excellent
 to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous
 to use it like a giant
lucio aside to isabella that's well said
isabella could great men thunder
 as jove himself does jove would ne'er be quiet
 for every pelting petty officer
 would use his heaven for thunder
 nothing but thunder merciful heaven
 thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
 split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
 than the soft myrtle but man proud man
 drest in a little brief authority
 most ignorant of what he's most assured
 his glassy essence like an angry ape
 plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
 as make the angels weep who with our spleens
 would all themselves laugh mortal
lucio aside to isabella o to him to him wench he
 will relent
 he's coming i perceive t
provost aside pray heaven she win him
isabella we cannot weigh our brother with ourself
 great men may jest with saints tis wit in them
 but in the less foul profanation
lucio thou'rt i the right girl more o that
isabella that in the captain's but a choleric word
 which in the soldier is flat blasphemy
lucio aside to isabella art avised o that more on t
angelo why do you put these sayings upon me
isabella because authority though it err like others
 hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
 that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom
 knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
 that's like my brother's fault if it confess
 a natural guiltiness such as is his
 let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
 against my brother's life
angelo aside she speaks and tis
 such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well
isabella gentle my lord turn back
angelo i will bethink me come again tomorrow
isabella hark how i'll bribe you good my lord turn back
angelo how bribe me
isabella ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you
lucio aside to isabella you had marr'd all else
isabella not with fond shekels of the tested gold
 or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
 as fancy values them but with true prayers
 that shall be up at heaven and enter there
 ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls
 from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
 to nothing temporal
angelo well come to me tomorrow
lucio aside to isabella go to tis well away
isabella heaven keep your honour safe
angelo aside amen
 for i am that way going to temptation
 where prayers cross
isabella at what hour tomorrow
 shall i attend your lordship
angelo at any time fore noon
isabella save your honour
 exeunt isabella lucio and provost
angelo from thee even from thy virtue
 what's this what's this is this her fault or mine
 the tempter or the tempted who sins most
 ha
 not she nor doth she tempt but it is i
 that lying by the violet in the sun
 do as the carrion does not as the flower
 corrupt with virtuous season can it be
 that modesty may more betray our sense
 than woman's lightness having waste ground enough
 shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
 and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie
 what dost thou or what art thou angelo
 dost thou desire her foully for those things
 that make her good o let her brother live
 thieves for their robbery have authority
 when judges steal themselves what do i love her
 that i desire to hear her speak again
 and feast upon her eyes what is't i dream on
 o cunning enemy that to catch a saint
 with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous
 is that temptation that doth goad us on
 to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet
 with all her double vigour art and nature
 once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
 subdues me quite even till now
 when men were fond i smiled and wonder'd how
 exit

scene iii a room in a prison
 enter severally duke vincentio disguised as a
 friar and provost
duke vincentio hail to you provost so i think you are
provost i am the provost what's your will good friar
duke vincentio bound by my charity and my blest order
 i come to visit the afflicted spirits
 here in the prison do me the common right
 to let me see them and to make me know
 the nature of their crimes that i may minister
 to them accordingly
provost i would do more than that if more were needful
 enter juliet
 look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine
 who falling in the flaws of her own youth
 hath blister'd her report she is with child
 and he that got it sentenced a young man
 more fit to do another such offence
 than die for this
duke vincentio when must he die
provost as i do think tomorrow
 i have provided for you stay awhile
 to juliet
 and you shall be conducted
duke vincentio repent you fair one of the sin you carry
juliet i do and bear the shame most patiently
duke vincentio i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
 and try your penitence if it be sound
 or hollowly put on
juliet i'll gladly learn
duke vincentio love you the man that wrong'd you
juliet yes as i love the woman that wrong'd him
duke vincentio so then it seems your most offenceful act
 was mutually committed
juliet mutually
duke vincentio then was your sin of heavier kind than his
juliet i do confess it and repent it father
duke vincentio tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent
 as that the sin hath brought you to this shame
 which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven
 showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
 but as we stand in fear
juliet i do repent me as it is an evil
 and take the shame with joy
duke vincentio there rest
 your partner as i hear must die tomorrow
 and i am going with instruction to him
 grace go with you benedicite
 exit
juliet must die tomorrow o injurious love
 that respites me a life whose very comfort
 is still a dying horror
provost tis pity of him

scene iv a room in angelo's house
 enter angelo
angelo when i would pray and think i think and pray
 to several subjects heaven hath my empty words
 whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
 anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth
 as if i did but only chew his name
 and in my heart the strong and swelling evil
 of my conception the state whereon i studied
 is like a good thing being often read
 grown fear'd and tedious yea my gravity
 whereinlet no man hear mei take pride
 could i with boot change for an idle plume
 which the air beats for vain o place o form
 how often dost thou with thy case thy habit
 wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
 to thy false seeming blood thou art blood
 let's write good angel on the devil's horn
 tis not the devil's crest
 enter a servant
 how now who's there
servant one isabel a sister desires access to you
angelo teach her the way
 exit servant
 o heavens
 why does my blood thus muster to my heart
 making both it unable for itself
 and dispossessing all my other parts
 of necessary fitness
 so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
 come all to help him and so stop the air
 by which he should revive and even so
 the general subject to a wellwish'd king
 quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
 crowd to his presence where their untaught love
 must needs appear offence
 enter isabella
 how now fair maid
isabella i am come to know your pleasure
angelo that you might know it would much better please me
 than to demand what tis your brother cannot live
isabella even so heaven keep your honour
angelo yet may he live awhile and it may be
 as long as you or i yet he must die
isabella under your sentence
angelo yea
isabella when i beseech you that in his reprieve
 longer or shorter he may be so fitted
 that his soul sicken not
angelo ha fie these filthy vices it were as good
 to pardon him that hath from nature stolen
 a man already made as to remit
 their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
 in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy
 falsely to take away a life true made
 as to put metal in restrained means
 to make a false one
isabella tis set down so in heaven but not in earth
angelo say you so then i shall pose you quickly
 which had you rather that the most just law
 now took your brother's life or to redeem him
 give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
 as she that he hath stain'd
isabella sir believe this
 i had rather give my body than my soul
angelo i talk not of your soul our compell'd sins
 stand more for number than for accompt
isabella how say you
angelo nay i'll not warrant that for i can speak
 against the thing i say answer to this
 i now the voice of the recorded law
 pronounce a sentence on your brother's life
 might there not be a charity in sin
 to save this brother's life
isabella please you to do't
 i'll take it as a peril to my soul
 it is no sin at all but charity
angelo pleased you to do't at peril of your soul
 were equal poise of sin and charity
isabella that i do beg his life if it be sin
 heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit
 if that be sin i'll make it my morn prayer
 to have it added to the faults of mine
 and nothing of your answer
angelo nay but hear me
 your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant
 or seem so craftily and that's not good
isabella let me be ignorant and in nothing good
 but graciously to know i am no better
angelo thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
 when it doth tax itself as these black masks
 proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
 than beauty could display'd but mark me
 to be received plain i'll speak more gross
 your brother is to die
isabella so
angelo and his offence is so as it appears
 accountant to the law upon that pain
isabella true
angelo admit no other way to save his life
 as i subscribe not that nor any other
 but in the loss of questionthat you his sister
 finding yourself desired of such a person
 whose credit with the judge or own great place
 could fetch your brother from the manacles
 of the allbuilding law and that there were
 no earthly mean to save him but that either
 you must lay down the treasures of your body
 to this supposed or else to let him suffer
 what would you do
isabella as much for my poor brother as myself
 that is were i under the terms of death
 the impression of keen whips i'ld wear as rubies
 and strip myself to death as to a bed
 that longing have been sick for ere i'ld yield
 my body up to shame
angelo then must your brother die
isabella and twere the cheaper way
 better it were a brother died at once
 than that a sister by redeeming him
 should die for ever
angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentence
 that you have slander'd so
isabella ignomy in ransom and free pardon
 are of two houses lawful mercy
 is nothing kin to foul redemption
angelo you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant
 and rather proved the sliding of your brother
 a merriment than a vice
isabella o pardon me my lord it oft falls out
 to have what we would have we speak not what we mean
 i something do excuse the thing i hate
 for his advantage that i dearly love
angelo we are all frail
isabella else let my brother die
 if not a feodary but only he
 owe and succeed thy weakness
angelo nay women are frail too
isabella ay as the glasses where they view themselves
 which are as easy broke as they make forms
 women help heaven men their creation mar
 in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail
 for we are soft as our complexions are
 and credulous to false prints
angelo i think it well
 and from this testimony of your own sex
 since i suppose we are made to be no stronger
 than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold
 i do arrest your words be that you are
 that is a woman if you be more you're none
 if you be one as you are well express'd
 by all external warrants show it now
 by putting on the destined livery
isabella i have no tongue but one gentle my lord
 let me entreat you speak the former language
angelo plainly conceive i love you
isabella my brother did love juliet
 and you tell me that he shall die for it
angelo he shall not isabel if you give me love
isabella i know your virtue hath a licence in't
 which seems a little fouler than it is
 to pluck on others
angelo believe me on mine honour
 my words express my purpose
isabella ha little honour to be much believed
 and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming
 i will proclaim thee angelo look for't
 sign me a present pardon for my brother
 or with an outstretch'd throat i'll tell the world aloud
 what man thou art
angelo who will believe thee isabel
 my unsoil'd name the austereness of my life
 my vouch against you and my place i the state
 will so your accusation overweigh
 that you shall stifle in your own report
 and smell of calumny i have begun
 and now i give my sensual race the rein
 fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
 lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
 that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
 by yielding up thy body to my will
 or else he must not only die the death
 but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
 to lingering sufferance answer me tomorrow
 or by the affection that now guides me most
 i'll prove a tyrant to him as for you
 say what you can my false o'erweighs your true
 exit
isabella to whom should i complain did i tell this
 who would believe me o perilous mouths
 that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue
 either of condemnation or approof
 bidding the law make court'sy to their will
 hooking both right and wrong to the appetite
 to follow as it draws i'll to my brother
 though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood
 yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
 that had he twenty heads to tender down
 on twenty bloody blocks he'ld yield them up
 before his sister should her body stoop
 to such abhorr'd pollution
 then isabel live chaste and brother die
 more than our brother is our chastity
 i'll tell him yet of angelo's request
 and fit his mind to death for his soul's rest

act iii
scene i a room in the prison
 enter duke vincentio disguised as before claudio
 and provost
duke vincentio so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo
claudio the miserable have no other medicine
 but only hope
 i've hope to live and am prepared to die
duke vincentio be absolute for death either death or life
 shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life
 if i do lose thee i do lose a thing
 that none but fools would keep a breath thou art
 servile to all the skyey influences
 that dost this habitation where thou keep'st
 hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool
 for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
 and yet runn'st toward him still thou art not noble
 for all the accommodations that thou bear'st
 are nursed by baseness thou'rt by no means valiant
 for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
 of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep
 and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fear'st
 thy death which is no more thou art not thyself
 for thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
 that issue out of dust happy thou art not
 for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get
 and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain
 for thy complexion shifts to strange effects
 after the moon if thou art rich thou'rt poor
 for like an ass whose back with ingots bows
 thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey
 and death unloads thee friend hast thou none
 for thine own bowels which do call thee sire
 the mere effusion of thy proper loins
 do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
 for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age
 but as it were an afterdinner's sleep
 dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
 becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
 of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
 thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
 to make thy riches pleasant what's yet in this
 that bears the name of life yet in this life
 lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear
 that makes these odds all even
claudio i humbly thank you
 to sue to live i find i seek to die
 and seeking death find life let it come on
isabella within what ho peace here grace and good company
provost who's there come in the wish deserves a welcome
duke vincentio dear sir ere long i'll visit you again
claudio most holy sir i thank you
 enter isabella
isabella my business is a word or two with claudio
provost and very welcome look signior here's your sister
duke vincentio provost a word with you
provost as many as you please
duke vincentio bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed
 exeunt duke vincentio and provost
claudio now sister what's the comfort
isabella why
 as all comforts are most good most good indeed
 lord angelo having affairs to heaven
 intends you for his swift ambassador
 where you shall be an everlasting leiger
 therefore your best appointment make with speed
 tomorrow you set on
claudio is there no remedy
isabella none but such remedy as to save a head
 to cleave a heart in twain
claudio but is there any
isabella yes brother you may live
 there is a devilish mercy in the judge
 if you'll implore it that will free your life
 but fetter you till death
claudio perpetual durance
isabella ay just perpetual durance a restraint
 though all the world's vastidity you had
 to a determined scope
claudio but in what nature
isabella in such a one as you consenting to't
 would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
 and leave you naked
claudio let me know the point
isabella o i do fear thee claudio and i quake
 lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
 and six or seven winters more respect
 than a perpetual honour darest thou die
 the sense of death is most in apprehension
 and the poor beetle that we tread upon
 in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
 as when a giant dies
claudio why give you me this shame
 think you i can a resolution fetch
 from flowery tenderness if i must die
 i will encounter darkness as a bride
 and hug it in mine arms
isabella there spake my brother there my father's grave
 did utter forth a voice yes thou must die
 thou art too noble to conserve a life
 in base appliances this outwardsainted deputy
 whose settled visage and deliberate word
 nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew
 as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
 his filth within being cast he would appear
 a pond as deep as hell
claudio the prenzie angelo
isabella o tis the cunning livery of hell
 the damned'st body to invest and cover
 in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio
 if i would yield him my virginity
 thou mightst be freed
claudio o heavens it cannot be
isabella yes he would give't thee from this rank offence
 so to offend him still this night's the time
 that i should do what i abhor to name
 or else thou diest tomorrow
claudio thou shalt not do't
isabella o were it but my life
 i'ld throw it down for your deliverance
 as frankly as a pin
claudio thanks dear isabel
isabella be ready claudio for your death tomorrow
claudio yes has he affections in him
 that thus can make him bite the law by the nose
 when he would force it sure it is no sin
 or of the deadly seven it is the least
isabella which is the least
claudio if it were damnable he being so wise
 why would he for the momentary trick
 be perdurably fined o isabel
isabella what says my brother
claudio death is a fearful thing
isabella and shamed life a hateful
claudio ay but to die and go we know not where
 to lie in cold obstruction and to rot
 this sensible warm motion to become
 a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
 to bathe in fiery floods or to reside
 in thrilling region of thickribbed ice
 to be imprison'd in the viewless winds
 and blown with restless violence round about
 the pendent world or to be worse than worst
 of those that lawless and incertain thought
 imagine howling tis too horrible
 the weariest and most loathed worldly life
 that age ache penury and imprisonment
 can lay on nature is a paradise
 to what we fear of death
isabella alas alas
claudio sweet sister let me live
 what sin you do to save a brother's life
 nature dispenses with the deed so far
 that it becomes a virtue
isabella o you beast
 o faithless coward o dishonest wretch
 wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
 is't not a kind of incest to take life
 from thine own sister's shame what should i think
 heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair
 for such a warped slip of wilderness
 ne'er issued from his blood take my defiance
 die perish might but my bending down
 reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
 i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death
 no word to save thee
claudio nay hear me isabel
isabella o fie fie fie
 thy sin's not accidental but a trade
 mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
 tis best thou diest quickly
claudio o hear me isabella
 reenter duke vincentio
duke vincentio vouchsafe a word young sister but one word
isabella what is your will
duke vincentio might you dispense with your leisure i would by and
 by have some speech with you the satisfaction i
 would require is likewise your own benefit
isabella i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be
 stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile
 walks apart
duke vincentio son i have overheard what hath passed between you
 and your sister angelo had never the purpose to
 corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her
 virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
 of natures she having the truth of honour in her
 hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
 glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i
 know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to
 death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
 that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to
 your knees and make ready
claudio let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love
 with life that i will sue to be rid of it
duke vincentio hold you there farewell
 exit claudio
 provost a word with you
 reenter provost
provost what's your will father
duke vincentio that now you are come you will be gone leave me
 awhile with the maid my mind promises with my
 habit no loss shall touch her by my company
provost in good time
 exit provost isabella comes forward
duke vincentio the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good
 the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
 brief in goodness but grace being the soul of
 your complexion shall keep the body of it ever
 fair the assault that angelo hath made to you
 fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but
 that frailty hath examples for his falling i should
 wonder at angelo how will you do to content this
 substitute and to save your brother
isabella i am now going to resolve him i had rather my
 brother die by the law than my son should be
 unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke
 deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can
 speak to him i will open my lips in vain or
 discover his government
duke vincentio that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter
 now stands he will avoid your accusation he made
 trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my
 advisings to the love i have in doing good a
 remedy presents itself i do make myself believe
 that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
 lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from
 the angry law do no stain to your own gracious
 person and much please the absent duke if
 peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
 this business
isabella let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do
 anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit
duke vincentio virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have
 you not heard speak of mariana the sister of
 frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea
isabella i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name
duke vincentio she should this angelo have married was affianced
 to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between
 which time of the contract and limit of the
 solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea
 having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
 sister but mark how heavily this befell to the
 poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and
 renowned brother in his love toward her ever most
 kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of
 her fortune her marriagedowry with both her
 combinate husband this wellseeming angelo
isabella can this be so did angelo so leave her
duke vincentio left her in her tears and dried not one of them
 with his comfort swallowed his vows whole
 pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few
 bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet
 wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears
 is washed with them but relents not
isabella what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
 from the world what corruption in this life that
 it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail
duke vincentio it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the
 cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps
 you from dishonour in doing it
isabella show me how good father
duke vincentio this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
 of her first affection his unjust unkindness that
 in all reason should have quenched her love hath
 like an impediment in the current made it more
 violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his
 requiring with a plausible obedience agree with
 his demands to the point only refer yourself to
 this advantage first that your stay with him may
 not be long that the time may have all shadow and
 silence in it and the place answer to convenience
 this being granted in courseand now follows
 allwe shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
 your appointment go in your place if the encounter
 acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to
 her recompense and here by this is your brother
 saved your honour untainted the poor mariana
 advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid
 will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you
 think well to carry this as you may the doubleness
 of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof
 what think you of it
isabella the image of it gives me content already and i
 trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection
duke vincentio it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily
 to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his
 bed give him promise of satisfaction i will
 presently to saint luke's there at the moated
 grange resides this dejected mariana at that
 place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that
 it may be quickly
isabella i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father

 what news
elbow come your ways sir come
lucio go to kennel pompey go
 exeunt elbow pompey and officers
 what news friar of the duke
duke vincentio i know none can you tell me of any
lucio some say he is with the emperor of russia other
 some he is in rome but where is he think you
duke vincentio i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well
lucio it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
 the state and usurp the beggary he was never born
 to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he
 puts transgression to t
duke vincentio he does well in t
lucio a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
 him something too crabbed that way friar
duke vincentio it is too general a vice and severity must cure it
lucio yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred
 it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp
 it quite friar till eating and drinking be put
 down they say this angelo was not made by man and
 woman after this downright way of creation is it
 true think you
duke vincentio how should he be made then
lucio some report a seamaid spawned him some that he
 was begot between two stockfishes but it is
 certain that when he makes water his urine is
 congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a
 motion generative that's infallible
duke vincentio you are pleasant sir and speak apace
lucio why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the
 rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
 man would the duke that is absent have done this
 ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
 hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing
 a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he
 knew the service and that instructed him to mercy
duke vincentio i never heard the absent duke much detected for
 women he was not inclined that way
lucio o sir you are deceived
duke vincentio tis not possible
lucio who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and
 his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish the
 duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too
 that let me inform you
duke vincentio you do him wrong surely
lucio sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the
 duke and i believe i know the cause of his
 withdrawing
duke vincentio what i prithee might be the cause
lucio no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the
 teeth and the lips but this i can let you
 understand the greater file of the subject held the
 duke to be wise
duke vincentio wise why no question but he was
lucio a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow
duke vincentio either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking
 the very stream of his life and the business he hath
 helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
 proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own
 bringingsforth and he shall appear to the
 envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier
 therefore you speak unskilfully or if your
 knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice
lucio sir i know him and i love him
duke vincentio love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with
 dearer love
lucio come sir i know what i know
duke vincentio i can hardly believe that since you know not what
 you speak but if ever the duke return as our
 prayers are he may let me desire you to make your
 answer before him if it be honest you have spoke
 you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call
 upon you and i pray you your name
lucio sir my name is lucio well known to the duke
duke vincentio he shall know you better sir if i may live to
 report you
lucio i fear you not
duke vincentio o you hope the duke will return no more or you
 imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i
 can do you little harm you'll forswear this again
lucio i'll be hanged first thou art deceived in me
 friar but no more of this canst thou tell if
 claudio die tomorrow or no
duke vincentio why should he die sir
lucio why for filling a bottle with a tundish i would
 the duke we talk of were returned again the
 ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
 continency sparrows must not build in his
 houseeaves because they are lecherous the duke
 yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would
 never bring them to light would he were returned
 marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing
 farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the
 duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on
 fridays he's not past it yet and i say to thee
 he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown
 bread and garlic say that i said so farewell

escalus go away with her to prison
mistress overdone good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted
 a merciful man good my lord
escalus double and treble admonition and still forfeit in
 the same kind this would make mercy swear and play
 the tyrant
provost a bawd of eleven years continuance may it please
 your honour
mistress overdone my lord this is one lucio's information against me
 mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the
 duke's time he promised her marriage his child
 is a year and a quarter old come philip and jacob
 i have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me
escalus that fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be
 called before us away with her to prison go to
 no more words
 exeunt officers with mistress overdone
 provost my brother angelo will not be altered
 claudio must die tomorrow let him be furnished
 with divines and have all charitable preparation
 if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be
 so with him
provost so please you this friar hath been with him and
 advised him for the entertainment of death
escalus good even good father
duke vincentio bliss and goodness on you
escalus of whence are you
duke vincentio not of this country though my chance is now
 to use it for my time i am a brother
 of gracious order late come from the see
 in special business from his holiness
escalus what news abroad i the world
duke vincentio none but that there is so great a fever on
 goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it
 novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous
 to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous
 to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce
 truth enough alive to make societies secure but
 security enough to make fellowships accurst much
 upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this
 news is old enough yet it is every day's news i
 pray you sir of what disposition was the duke
escalus one that above all other strifes contended
 especially to know himself
duke vincentio what pleasure was he given to
escalus rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
 any thing which professed to make him rejoice a
 gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to
 his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous
 and let me desire to know how you find claudio
 prepared i am made to understand that you have
 lent him visitation
duke vincentio he professes to have received no sinister measure
 from his judge but most willingly humbles himself
 to the determination of justice yet had he framed
 to himself by the instruction of his frailty many
 deceiving promises of life which i by my good
 leisure have discredited to him and now is he
 resolved to die
escalus you have paid the heavens your function and the
 prisoner the very debt of your calling i have
 laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
 shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i
 found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him
 he is indeed justice
duke vincentio if his own life answer the straitness of his
 proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he
 chance to fail he hath sentenced himself
escalus i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well
duke vincentio peace be with you
 exeunt escalus and provost
 he who the sword of heaven will bear
 should be as holy as severe
 pattern in himself to know
 grace to stand and virtue go
 more nor less to others paying
 than by selfoffences weighing
 shame to him whose cruel striking
 kills for faults of his own liking
 twice treble shame on angelo
 to weed my vice and let his grow
 o what may man within him hide
 though angel on the outward side
 how may likeness made in crimes
 making practise on the times
 to draw with idle spiders strings
 most ponderous and substantial things
 craft against vice i must apply

 so disguise shall by the disguised
 pay with falsehood false exacting

provost none since the curfew rung
duke vincentio not isabel
provost no
duke vincentio they will then ere't be long
provost what comfort is for claudio
duke vincentio there's some in hope
provost it is a bitter deputy
duke vincentio not so not so his life is parallel'd
 even with the stroke and line of his great justice
 he doth with holy abstinence subdue
 that in himself which he spurs on his power
 to qualify in others were he meal'd with that
 which he corrects then were he tyrannous
 but this being so he's just
 knocking within
 now are they come
 exit provost
 this is a gentle provost seldom when
 the steeled gaoler is the friend of men
 knocking within
 how now what noise that spirit's possessed with haste
 that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes
 reenter provost
provost there he must stay until the officer
 arise to let him in he is call'd up
duke vincentio have you no countermand for claudio yet
 but he must die tomorrow
provost none sir none
duke vincentio as near the dawning provost as it is
 you shall hear more ere morning
provost happily
 you something know yet i believe there comes
 no countermand no such example have we
 besides upon the very siege of justice
 lord angelo hath to the public ear
 profess'd the contrary
 enter a messenger
 this is his lordship's man
duke vincentio and here comes claudio's pardon
messenger giving a paper
 my lord hath sent you this note and by me this
 further charge that you swerve not from the
 smallest article of it neither in time matter or
 other circumstance good morrow for as i take it
 it is almost day
provost i shall obey him
 exit messenger
duke vincentio aside this is his pardon purchased by such sin
 for which the pardoner himself is in
 hence hath offence his quick celerity
 when it is born in high authority
 when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended
 that for the fault's love is the offender friended
 now sir what news
provost i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss
 in mine office awakens me with this unwonted
 puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before
duke vincentio pray you let's hear
provost reads
 whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let
 claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the
 afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction
 let me have claudio's head sent me by five let
 this be duly performed with a thought that more
 depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail
 not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril'
 what say you to this sir
duke vincentio what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the
 afternoon
provost a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one
 that is a prisoner nine years old
duke vincentio how came it that the absent duke had not either
 delivered him to his liberty or executed him i
 have heard it was ever his manner to do so
provost his friends still wrought reprieves for him and
 indeed his fact till now in the government of lord
 angelo came not to an undoubtful proof
duke vincentio it is now apparent
provost most manifest and not denied by himself
duke vincentio hath he born himself penitently in prison how
 seems he to be touched
provost a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
 as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless
 of what's past present or to come insensible of
 mortality and desperately mortal
duke vincentio he wants advice
provost he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty
 of the prison give him leave to escape hence he
 would not drunk many times a day if not many days
 entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if
 to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming
 warrant for it it hath not moved him at all
duke vincentio more of him anon there is written in your brow
 provost honesty and constancy if i read it not
 truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the
 boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard
 claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is
 no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath
 sentenced him to make you understand this in a
 manifested effect i crave but four days respite
 for the which you are to do me both a present and a
 dangerous courtesy
provost pray sir in what
duke vincentio in the delaying death
provost a lack how may i do it having the hour limited
 and an express command under penalty to deliver
 his head in the view of angelo i may make my case
 as claudio's to cross this in the smallest
duke vincentio by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my
 instructions may be your guide let this barnardine
 be this morning executed and his head born to angelo
provost angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
duke vincentio o death's a great disguiser and you may add to it
 shave the head and tie the beard and say it was
 the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
 death you know the course is common if any thing
 fall to you upon this more than thanks and good
 fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead
 against it with my life
provost pardon me good father it is against my oath
duke vincentio were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
provost to him and to his substitutes
duke vincentio you will think you have made no offence if the duke
 avouch the justice of your dealing
provost but what likelihood is in that
duke vincentio not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see
 you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor
 persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go
 further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you
 look you sir here is the hand and seal of the
 duke you know the character i doubt not and the
 signet is not strange to you
provost i know them both
duke vincentio the contents of this is the return of the duke you
 shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you
 shall find within these two days he will be here
 this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this
 very day receives letters of strange tenor
 perchance of the duke's death perchance entering
 into some monastery but by chance nothing of what
 is writ look the unfolding star calls up the
 shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these
 things should be all difficulties are but easy
 when they are known call your executioner and off
 with barnardine's head i will give him a present
 shrift and advise him for a better place yet you
 are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you
 come away it is almost clear dawn

 enter angelo and escalus
escalus every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other
angelo in most uneven and distracted manner his actions
 show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be
 not tainted and why meet him at the gates and
 redeliver our authorities there
escalus i guess not
angelo and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
 entering that if any crave redress of injustice
 they should exhibit their petitions in the street
escalus he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of
 complaints and to deliver us from devices
 hereafter which shall then have no power to stand
 against us
angelo well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes
 i the morn i'll call you at your house give
 notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
 him
escalus i shall sir fare you well
angelo good night
 exit escalus
 this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
 and dull to all proceedings a deflower'd maid
 and by an eminent body that enforced
 the law against it but that her tender shame
 will not proclaim against her maiden loss
 how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no
 for my authority bears of a credent bulk
 that no particular scandal once can touch
 but it confounds the breather he should have lived
 save that riotous youth with dangerous sense
 might in the times to come have ta'en revenge
 by so receiving a dishonour'd life
 with ransom of such shame would yet he had lived
 a lack when once our grace we have forgot
 nothing goes right we would and we would not

 our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you
angelo 
 happy return be to your royal grace
escalus 
duke vincentio many and hearty thankings to you both
 we have made inquiry of you and we hear
 such goodness of your justice that our soul
 cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
 forerunning more requital
angelo you make my bonds still greater
duke vincentio o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it
 to lock it in the wards of covert bosom
 when it deserves with characters of brass
 a forted residence gainst the tooth of time
 and razure of oblivion give me your hand
 and let the subject see to make them know
 that outward courtesies would fain proclaim
 favours that keep within come escalus
 you must walk by us on our other hand
 and good supporters are you
 friar peter and isabella come forward
friar peter now is your time speak loud and kneel before him
isabella justice o royal duke vail your regard
 upon a wrong'd i would fain have said a maid
 o worthy prince dishonour not your eye
 by throwing it on any other object
 till you have heard me in my true complaint
 and given me justice justice justice justice
duke vincentio relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief
 here is lord angelo shall give you justice
 reveal yourself to him
isabella o worthy duke
 you bid me seek redemption of the devil
 hear me yourself for that which i must speak
 must either punish me not being believed
 or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here
angelo my lord her wits i fear me are not firm
 she hath been a suitor to me for her brother
 cut off by course of justice
isabella by course of justice
angelo and she will speak most bitterly and strange
isabella most strange but yet most truly will i speak
 that angelo's forsworn is it not strange
 that angelo's a murderer is t not strange
 that angelo is an adulterous thief
 an hypocrite a virginviolator
 is it not strange and strange
duke vincentio nay it is ten times strange
isabella it is not truer he is angelo
 than this is all as true as it is strange
 nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
 to the end of reckoning
duke vincentio away with her poor soul
 she speaks this in the infirmity of sense
isabella o prince i conjure thee as thou believest
 there is another comfort than this world
 that thou neglect me not with that opinion
 that i am touch'd with madness make not impossible
 that which but seems unlike tis not impossible
 but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground
 may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
 as angelo even so may angelo
 in all his dressings characts titles forms
 be an archvillain believe it royal prince
 if he be less he's nothing but he's more
 had i more name for badness
duke vincentio by mine honesty
 if she be madas i believe no other
 her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
 such a dependency of thing on thing
 as e'er i heard in madness
isabella o gracious duke
 harp not on that nor do not banish reason
 for inequality but let your reason serve
 to make the truth appear where it seems hid
 and hide the false seems true
duke vincentio many that are not mad
 have sure more lack of reason what would you say
isabella i am the sister of one claudio
 condemn'd upon the act of fornication
 to lose his head condemn'd by angelo
 i in probation of a sisterhood
 was sent to by my brother one lucio
 as then the messenger
lucio that's i an't like your grace
 i came to her from claudio and desired her
 to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo
 for her poor brother's pardon
isabella that's he indeed
duke vincentio you were not bid to speak
lucio no my good lord
 nor wish'd to hold my peace
duke vincentio i wish you now then
 pray you take note of it and when you have
 a business for yourself pray heaven you then
 be perfect
lucio i warrant your honour
duke vincentio the warrants for yourself take heed to't
isabella this gentleman told somewhat of my tale
lucio right
duke vincentio it may be right but you are i the wrong
 to speak before your time proceed
isabella i went
 to this pernicious caitiff deputy
duke vincentio that's somewhat madly spoken
isabella pardon it
 the phrase is to the matter
duke vincentio mended again the matter proceed
isabella in brief to set the needless process by
 how i persuaded how i pray'd and kneel'd
 how he refell'd me and how i replied
 for this was of much lengththe vile conclusion
 i now begin with grief and shame to utter
 he would not but by gift of my chaste body
 to his concupiscible intemperate lust
 release my brother and after much debatement
 my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
 and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes
 his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
 for my poor brother's head
duke vincentio this is most likely
isabella o that it were as like as it is true
duke vincentio by heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speak'st
 or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
 in hateful practise first his integrity
 stands without blemish next it imports no reason
 that with such vehemency he should pursue
 faults proper to himself if he had so offended
 he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
 and not have cut him off some one hath set you on
 confess the truth and say by whose advice
 thou camest here to complain
isabella and is this all
 then o you blessed ministers above
 keep me in patience and with ripen'd time
 unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
 in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe
 as i thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go
duke vincentio i know you'ld fain be gone an officer
 to prison with her shall we thus permit
 a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
 on him so near us this needs must be a practise
 who knew of your intent and coming hither
isabella one that i would were here friar lodowick
duke vincentio a ghostly father belike who knows that lodowick
lucio my lord i know him tis a meddling friar
 i do not like the man had he been lay my lord
 for certain words he spake against your grace
 in your retirement i had swinged him soundly
duke vincentio words against me this is a good friar belike
 and to set on this wretched woman here
 against our substitute let this friar be found
lucio but yesternight my lord she and that friar
 i saw them at the prison a saucy friar
 a very scurvy fellow
friar peter blessed be your royal grace
 i have stood by my lord and i have heard
 your royal ear abused first hath this woman
 most wrongfully accused your substitute
 who is as free from touch or soil with her
 as she from one ungot
duke vincentio we did believe no less
 know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of
friar peter i know him for a man divine and holy
 not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
 as he's reported by this gentleman
 and on my trust a man that never yet
 did as he vouches misreport your grace
lucio my lord most villanously believe it
friar peter well he in time may come to clear himself
 but at this instant he is sick my lord
 of a strange fever upon his mere request
 being come to knowledge that there was complaint
 intended gainst lord angelo came i hither
 to speak as from his mouth what he doth know
 is true and false and what he with his oath
 and all probation will make up full clear
 whensoever he's convented first for this woman
 to justify this worthy nobleman
 so vulgarly and personally accused
 her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
 till she herself confess it
duke vincentio good friar let's hear it
 isabella is carried off guarded and mariana comes forward
 do you not smile at this lord angelo
 o heaven the vanity of wretched fools
 give us some seats come cousin angelo
 in this i'll be impartial be you judge
 of your own cause is this the witness friar
 first let her show her face and after speak
mariana pardon my lord i will not show my face
 until my husband bid me
duke vincentio what are you married
mariana no my lord
duke vincentio are you a maid
mariana no my lord
duke vincentio a widow then
mariana neither my lord
duke vincentio why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife
lucio my lord she may be a punk for many of them are
 neither maid widow nor wife
duke vincentio silence that fellow i would he had some cause
 to prattle for himself
lucio well my lord
mariana my lord i do confess i ne'er was married
 and i confess besides i am no maid
 i have known my husband yet my husband
 knows not that ever he knew me
lucio he was drunk then my lord it can be no better
duke vincentio for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too
lucio well my lord
duke vincentio this is no witness for lord angelo
mariana now i come to't my lord
 she that accuses him of fornication
 in selfsame manner doth accuse my husband
 and charges him my lord with such a time
 when i'll depose i had him in mine arms
 with all the effect of love
angelo charges she more than me
mariana not that i know
duke vincentio no you say your husband
mariana why just my lord and that is angelo
 who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body
 but knows he thinks that he knows isabel's
angelo this is a strange abuse let's see thy face
mariana my husband bids me now i will unmask
 unveiling
 this is that face thou cruel angelo
 which once thou sworest was worth the looking on
 this is the hand which with a vow'd contract
 was fast belock'd in thine this is the body
 that took away the match from isabel
 and did supply thee at thy gardenhouse
 in her imagined person
duke vincentio know you this woman
lucio carnally she says
duke vincentio sirrah no more
lucio enough my lord
angelo my lord i must confess i know this woman
 and five years since there was some speech of marriage
 betwixt myself and her which was broke off
 partly for that her promised proportions
 came short of composition but in chief
 for that her reputation was disvalued
 in levity since which time of five years
 i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
 upon my faith and honour
mariana noble prince
 as there comes light from heaven and words from breath
 as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
 i am affianced this man's wife as strongly
 as words could make up vows and my good lord
 but tuesday night last gone in's gardenhouse
 he knew me as a wife as this is true
 let me in safety raise me from my knees
 or else for ever be confixed here
 a marble monument
angelo i did but smile till now
 now good my lord give me the scope of justice
 my patience here is touch'd i do perceive
 these poor informal women are no more
 but instruments of some more mightier member
 that sets them on let me have way my lord
 to find this practise out
duke vincentio ay with my heart
 and punish them to your height of pleasure
 thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman
 compact with her that's gone think'st thou thy oaths
 though they would swear down each particular saint
 were testimonies against his worth and credit
 that's seal'd in approbation you lord escalus
 sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains
 to find out this abuse whence tis derived
 there is another friar that set them on
 let him be sent for
friar peter would he were here my lord for he indeed
 hath set the women on to this complaint

 and he may fetch him

escalus why thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar
 is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
 to accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth
 and in the witness of his proper ear
 to call him villain and then to glance from him
 to the duke himself to tax him with injustice
 take him hence to the rack with him we'll touse you
 joint by joint but we will know his purpose
 what unjust'

 fool and a coward as you then reported him to be
duke vincentio you must sir change persons with me ere you make
 that my report you indeed spoke so of him and
 much more much worse
lucio o thou damnable fellow did not i pluck thee by the
 nose for thy speeches

 treasonable abuses

 to angelo
 sir by your leave
 hast thou or word or wit or impudence
 that yet can do thee office if thou hast
 rely upon it till my tale be heard

 when i perceive your grace like power divine
 hath look'd upon my passes then good prince
 no longer session hold upon my shame
 but let my trial be mine own confession

angelo i was my lord
duke vincentio go take her hence and marry her instantly
 do you the office friar which consummate
 return him here again go with him provost
 exeunt angelo mariana friar peter and provost
escalus my lord i am more amazed at his dishonour
 than at the strangeness of it
duke vincentio come hither isabel
 your friar is now your prince as i was then
 advertising and holy to your business
 not changing heart with habit i am still
 attorney'd at your service
isabella o give me pardon
 that i your vassal have employ'd and pain'd
 your unknown sovereignty
duke vincentio you are pardon'd isabel
 and now dear maid be you as free to us
 your brother's death i know sits at your heart
 and you may marvel why i obscured myself
 labouring to save his life and would not rather
 make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
 than let him so be lost o most kind maid
 it was the swift celerity of his death
 which i did think with slower foot came on
 that brain'd my purpose but peace be with him
 that life is better life past fearing death
 than that which lives to fear make it your comfort
 so happy is your brother
isabella i do my lord
 reenter angelo mariana friar peter and provost
duke vincentio for this newmarried man approaching here
 whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
 your well defended honour you must pardon
 for mariana's sake but as he adjudged your brother
 being criminal in double violation
 of sacred chastity and of promisebreach
 thereon dependent for your brother's life
 the very mercy of the law cries out
 most audible even from his proper tongue
 an angelo for claudio death for death'
 haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
 like doth quit like and measure still for measure
 then angelo thy fault's thus manifested
 which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
 we do condemn thee to the very block
 where claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste
 away with him
mariana o my most gracious lord
 i hope you will not mock me with a husband
duke vincentio it is your husband mock'd you with a husband
 consenting to the safeguard of your honour
 i thought your marriage fit else imputation
 for that he knew you might reproach your life
 and choke your good to come for his possessions
 although by confiscation they are ours
 we do instate and widow you withal
 to buy you a better husband
mariana o my dear lord
 i crave no other nor no better man
duke vincentio never crave him we are definitive
mariana gentle my liege
 kneeling
duke vincentio you do but lose your labour
 away with him to death
 to lucio
 now sir to you
mariana o my good lord sweet isabel take my part
 lend me your knees and all my life to come
 i'll lend you all my life to do you service
duke vincentio against all sense you do importune her
 should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
 her brother's ghost his paved bed would break
 and take her hence in horror
mariana isabel
 sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me
 hold up your hands say nothing i'll speak all
 they say best men are moulded out of faults
 and for the most become much more the better
 for being a little bad so may my husband
 o isabel will you not lend a knee
duke vincentio he dies for claudio's death
isabella most bounteous sir
 kneeling
 look if it please you on this man condemn'd
 as if my brother lived i partly think
 a due sincerity govern'd his deeds
 till he did look on me since it is so
 let him not die my brother had but justice
 in that he did the thing for which he died
 for angelo
 his act did not o'ertake his bad intent
 and must be buried but as an intent
 that perish'd by the way thoughts are no subjects
 intents but merely thoughts
mariana merely my lord
duke vincentio your suit's unprofitable stand up i say
 i have bethought me of another fault
 provost how came it claudio was beheaded
 at an unusual hour
provost it was commanded so
duke vincentio had you a special warrant for the deed
provost no my good lord it was by private message
duke vincentio for which i do discharge you of your office
 give up your keys
provost pardon me noble lord
 i thought it was a fault but knew it not
 yet did repent me after more advice
 for testimony whereof one in the prison
 that should by private order else have died
 i have reserved alive
duke vincentio what's he
provost his name is barnardine
duke vincentio i would thou hadst done so by claudio
 go fetch him hither let me look upon him
 exit provost
escalus i am sorry one so learned and so wise
 as you lord angelo have still appear'd
 should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
 and lack of temper'd judgment afterward
angelo i am sorry that such sorrow i procure
 and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
 that i crave death more willingly than mercy
 tis my deserving and i do entreat it
 reenter provost with barnardine claudio muffled
 and juliet
duke vincentio which is that barnardine
provost this my lord
duke vincentio there was a friar told me of this man
 sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
 that apprehends no further than this world
 and squarest thy life according thou'rt condemn'd
 but for those earthly faults i quit them all
 and pray thee take this mercy to provide
 for better times to come friar advise him
 i leave him to your hand what muffled fellow's that
provost this is another prisoner that i saved
 who should have died when claudio lost his head
 as like almost to claudio as himself
 unmuffles claudio
duke vincentio to isabella if he be like your brother for his sake
 is he pardon'd and for your lovely sake
 give me your hand and say you will be mine
 he is my brother too but fitter time for that
 by this lord angelo perceives he's safe
 methinks i see a quickening in his eye
 well angelo your evil quits you well
 look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
 i find an apt remission in myself
 and yet here's one in place i cannot pardon
 to lucio
 you sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward
 one all of luxury an ass a madman
 wherein have i so deserved of you
 that you extol me thus
lucio faith my lord i spoke it but according to the
 trick if you will hang me for it you may but i
 had rather it would please you i might be whipt
duke vincentio whipt first sir and hanged after
 proclaim it provost round about the city
 is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow
 as i have heard him swear himself there's one
 whom he begot with child let her appear
 and he shall marry her the nuptial finish'd
 let him be whipt and hang'd
lucio i beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore
 your highness said even now i made you a duke
 good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold
duke vincentio upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
 thy slanders i forgive and therewithal
 remit thy other forfeits take him to prison
 and see our pleasure herein executed
lucio marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death
 whipping and hanging
duke vincentio slandering a prince deserves it
 exit officers with lucio
 she claudio that you wrong'd look you restore
 joy to you mariana love her angelo
 i have confess'd her and i know her virtue
 thanks good friend escalus for thy much goodness
 there's more behind that is more gratulate
 thanks provost for thy care and secrecy
 we shill employ thee in a worthier place

 the head of ragozine for claudio's
 the offence pardons itself dear isabel

 whereto if you'll a willing ear incline
 what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine

 which touching but my gentle vessel's side
 would scatter all her spices on the stream
 enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
 and in a word but even now worth this
 and now worth nothing shall i have the thought
 to think on this and shall i lack the thought
 that such a thing bechanced would make me sad
 but tell not me i know antonio
 is sad to think upon his merchandise
antonio believe me no i thank my fortune for it
 my ventures are not in one bottom trusted
 nor to one place nor is my whole estate
 upon the fortune of this present year
 therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
salarino why then you are in love
antonio fie fie
salarino not in love neither then let us say you are sad
 because you are not merry and twere as easy
 for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
 because you are not sad now by twoheaded janus
 nature hath framed strange fellows in her time
 some that will evermore peep through their eyes
 and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper
 and other of such vinegar aspect
 that they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
 though nestor swear the jest be laughable
 enter bassanio lorenzo and gratiano
salanio here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman
 gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well
 we leave you now with better company
salarino i would have stay'd till i had made you merry
 if worthier friends had not prevented me
antonio your worth is very dear in my regard
 i take it your own business calls on you
 and you embrace the occasion to depart
salarino good morrow my good lords
bassanio good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
 you grow exceeding strange must it be so
salarino we'll make our leisures to attend on yours
 exeunt salarino and salanio
lorenzo my lord bassanio since you have found antonio
 we two will leave you but at dinnertime
 i pray you have in mind where we must meet
bassanio i will not fail you
gratiano you look not well signior antonio
 you have too much respect upon the world
 they lose it that do buy it with much care
 believe me you are marvellously changed
antonio i hold the world but as the world gratiano
 a stage where every man must play a part
 and mine a sad one
gratiano let me play the fool
 with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
 and let my liver rather heat with wine
 than my heart cool with mortifying groans
 why should a man whose blood is warm within
 sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
 sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
 by being peevish i tell thee what antonio
 i love thee and it is my love that speaks
 there are a sort of men whose visages
 do cream and mantle like a standing pond
 and do a wilful stillness entertain
 with purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
 of wisdom gravity profound conceit
 as who should say i am sir oracle
 and when i ope my lips let no dog bark'
 o my antonio i do know of these
 that therefore only are reputed wise
 for saying nothing when i am very sure
 if they should speak would almost damn those ears
 which hearing them would call their brothers fools
 i'll tell thee more of this another time
 but fish not with this melancholy bait
 for this fool gudgeon this opinion
 come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile
 i'll end my exhortation after dinner
lorenzo well we will leave you then till dinnertime
 i must be one of these same dumb wise men
 for gratiano never lets me speak
gratiano well keep me company but two years moe
 thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
antonio farewell i'll grow a talker for this gear
gratiano thanks i faith for silence is only commendable
 in a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
 exeunt gratiano and lorenzo
antonio is that any thing now
bassanio gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more
 than any man in all venice his reasons are as two
 grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you
 shall seek all day ere you find them and when you
 have them they are not worth the search
antonio well tell me now what lady is the same
 to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
 that you today promised to tell me of
bassanio tis not unknown to you antonio
 how much i have disabled mine estate
 by something showing a more swelling port
 than my faint means would grant continuance
 nor do i now make moan to be abridged
 from such a noble rate but my chief care
 is to come fairly off from the great debts
 wherein my time something too prodigal
 hath left me gaged to you antonio
 i owe the most in money and in love
 and from your love i have a warranty
 to unburden all my plots and purposes
 how to get clear of all the debts i owe
antonio i pray you good bassanio let me know it
 and if it stand as you yourself still do
 within the eye of honour be assured
 my purse my person my extremest means
 lie all unlock'd to your occasions
bassanio in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft
 i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight
 the selfsame way with more advised watch
 to find the other forth and by adventuring both
 i oft found both i urge this childhood proof
 because what follows is pure innocence
 i owe you much and like a wilful youth
 that which i owe is lost but if you please
 to shoot another arrow that self way
 which you did shoot the first i do not doubt
 as i will watch the aim or to find both
 or bring your latter hazard back again
 and thankfully rest debtor for the first
antonio you know me well and herein spend but time
 to wind about my love with circumstance
 and out of doubt you do me now more wrong
 in making question of my uttermost
 than if you had made waste of all i have
 then do but say to me what i should do
 that in your knowledge may by me be done
 and i am prest unto it therefore speak
bassanio in belmont is a lady richly left
 and she is fair and fairer than that word
 of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
 i did receive fair speechless messages
 her name is portia nothing undervalued
 to cato's daughter brutus portia
 nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
 for the four winds blow in from every coast
 renowned suitors and her sunny locks
 hang on her temples like a golden fleece
 which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand
 and many jasons come in quest of her
 o my antonio had i but the means
 to hold a rival place with one of them
 i have a mind presages me such thrift
 that i should questionless be fortunate
antonio thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea
 neither have i money nor commodity
 to raise a present sum therefore go forth
 try what my credit can in venice do
 that shall be rack'd even to the uttermost
 to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia
 go presently inquire and so will i
 where money is and i no question make
 to have it of my trust or for my sake

act i
scene ii belmont a room in portia's house
 enter portia and nerissa
portia by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of
 this great world
nerissa you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in
 the same abundance as your good fortunes are and
 yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit
 with too much as they that starve with nothing it
 is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the
 mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but
 competency lives longer
portia good sentences and well pronounced
nerissa they would be better if well followed
portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to
 do chapels had been churches and poor men's
 cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that
 follows his own instructions i can easier teach
 twenty what were good to be done than be one of the
 twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may
 devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps
 o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the
 youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
 cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to
 choose me a husband o me the word choose i may
 neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i
 dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed
 by the will of a dead father is it not hard
 nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none
nerissa your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their
 death have good inspirations therefore the lottery
 that he hath devised in these three chests of gold
 silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning
 chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any
 rightly but one who shall rightly love but what
 warmth is there in your affection towards any of
 these princely suitors that are already come
portia i pray thee overname them and as thou namest
 them i will describe them and according to my
 description level at my affection
nerissa first there is the neapolitan prince
portia ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but
 talk of his horse and he makes it a great
 appropriation to his own good parts that he can
 shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his
 mother played false with a smith
nerissa then there is the county palatine
portia he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you
 will not have me choose he hears merry tales and
 smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping
 philosopher when he grows old being so full of
 unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be
 married to a death'shead with a bone in his mouth
 than to either of these god defend me from these
 two
nerissa how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon
portia god made him and therefore let him pass for a man
 in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but
 he why he hath a horse better than the
 neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than
 the count palatine he is every man in no man if a
 throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will
 fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i
 should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me
 i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i
 shall never requite him
nerissa what say you then to falconbridge the young baron
 of england
portia you know i say nothing to him for he understands
 not me nor i him he hath neither latin french
 nor italian and you will come into the court and
 swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english
 he is a proper man's picture but alas who can
 converse with a dumbshow how oddly he is suited
 i think he bought his doublet in italy his round
 hose in france his bonnet in germany and his
 behavior every where
nerissa what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour
portia that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he
 borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and
 swore he would pay him again when he was able i
 think the frenchman became his surety and sealed
 under for another
nerissa how like you the young german the duke of saxony's nephew
portia very vilely in the morning when he is sober and
 most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when
 he is best he is a little worse than a man and
 when he is worst he is little better than a beast
 and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall
 make shift to go without him
nerissa if he should offer to choose and choose the right
 casket you should refuse to perform your father's
 will if you should refuse to accept him
portia therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a
 deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket
 for if the devil be within and that temptation
 without i know he will choose it i will do any
 thing nerissa ere i'll be married to a sponge
nerissa you need not fear lady the having any of these
 lords they have acquainted me with their
 determinations which is indeed to return to their
 home and to trouble you with no more suit unless
 you may be won by some other sort than your father's
 imposition depending on the caskets
portia if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as
 chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner
 of my father's will i am glad this parcel of wooers
 are so reasonable for there is not one among them
 but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant
 them a fair departure
nerissa do you not remember lady in your father's time a
 venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither
 in company of the marquis of montferrat
portia yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so called
nerissa true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish
 eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
portia i remember him well and i remember him worthy of
 thy praise
 enter a servingman
 how now what news
servant the four strangers seek for you madam to take
 their leave and there is a forerunner come from a
 fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the
 prince his master will be here tonight
portia if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
 heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should
 be glad of his approach if he have the condition
 of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had
 rather he should shrive me than wive me come
 nerissa sirrah go before
 whiles we shut the gates
 upon one wooer another knocks at the door

shylock three thousand ducats well
bassanio ay sir for three months
shylock for three months well
bassanio for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound
shylock antonio shall become bound well
bassanio may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i
 know your answer
shylock three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound
bassanio your answer to that
shylock antonio is a good man
bassanio have you heard any imputation to the contrary
shylock oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a
 good man is to have you understand me that he is
 sufficient yet his means are in supposition he
 hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the
 indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he
 hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and
 other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships
 are but boards sailors but men there be landrats
 and waterrats waterthieves and landthieves i
 mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters
 winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding
 sufficient three thousand ducats i think i may
 take his bond
bassanio be assured you may
shylock i will be assured i may and that i may be assured
 i will bethink me may i speak with antonio
bassanio if it please you to dine with us
shylock yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which
 your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into i
 will buy with you sell with you talk with you
 walk with you and so following but i will not eat
 with you drink with you nor pray with you what
 news on the rialto who is he comes here
 enter antonio
bassanio this is signior antonio
shylock aside how like a fawning publican he looks
 i hate him for he is a christian
 but more for that in low simplicity
 he lends out money gratis and brings down
 the rate of usance here with us in venice
 if i can catch him once upon the hip
 i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him
 he hates our sacred nation and he rails
 even there where merchants most do congregate
 on me my bargains and my wellwon thrift
 which he calls interest cursed be my tribe
 if i forgive him
bassanio shylock do you hear
shylock i am debating of my present store
 and by the near guess of my memory
 i cannot instantly raise up the gross
 of full three thousand ducats what of that
 tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe
 will furnish me but soft how many months
 do you desire
 to antonio
 rest you fair good signior
 your worship was the last man in our mouths
antonio shylock although i neither lend nor borrow
 by taking nor by giving of excess
 yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
 i'll break a custom is he yet possess'd
 how much ye would
shylock ay ay three thousand ducats
antonio and for three months
shylock i had forgot three months you told me so
 well then your bond and let me see but hear you
 methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
 upon advantage
antonio i do never use it
shylock when jacob grazed his uncle laban's sheep
 this jacob from our holy abram was
 as his wise mother wrought in his behalf
 the third possessor ay he was the third
antonio and what of him did he take interest
shylock no not take interest not as you would say
 directly interest mark what jacob did
 when laban and himself were compromised
 that all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
 should fall as jacob's hire the ewes being rank
 in the end of autumn turned to the rams
 and when the work of generation was
 between these woolly breeders in the act
 the skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands
 and in the doing of the deed of kind
 he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
 who then conceiving did in eaning time
 fall particolour'd lambs and those were jacob's
 this was a way to thrive and he was blest
 and thrift is blessing if men steal it not
antonio this was a venture sir that jacob served for
 a thing not in his power to bring to pass
 but sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven
 was this inserted to make interest good
 or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
shylock i cannot tell i make it breed as fast
 but note me signior
antonio mark you this bassanio
 the devil can cite scripture for his purpose
 an evil soul producing holy witness
 is like a villain with a smiling cheek
 a goodly apple rotten at the heart
 o what a goodly outside falsehood hath
shylock three thousand ducats tis a good round sum
 three months from twelve then let me see the rate
antonio well shylock shall we be beholding to you
shylock signior antonio many a time and oft
 in the rialto you have rated me
 about my moneys and my usances
 still have i borne it with a patient shrug
 for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe
 you call me misbeliever cutthroat dog
 and spit upon my jewish gaberdine
 and all for use of that which is mine own
 well then it now appears you need my help
 go to then you come to me and you say
 shylock we would have moneys you say so
 you that did void your rheum upon my beard
 and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
 over your threshold moneys is your suit
 what should i say to you should i not say
 hath a dog money is it possible
 a cur can lend three thousand ducats or
 shall i bend low and in a bondman's key
 with bated breath and whispering humbleness say this
 fair sir you spit on me on wednesday last
 you spurn'd me such a day another time
 you call'd me dog and for these courtesies
 i'll lend you thus much moneys'
antonio i am as like to call thee so again
 to spit on thee again to spurn thee too
 if thou wilt lend this money lend it not
 as to thy friends for when did friendship take
 a breed for barren metal of his friend
 but lend it rather to thine enemy
 who if he break thou mayst with better face
 exact the penalty
shylock why look you how you storm
 i would be friends with you and have your love
 forget the shames that you have stain'd me with
 supply your present wants and take no doit
 of usance for my moneys and you'll not hear me
 this is kind i offer
bassanio this were kindness
shylock this kindness will i show
 go with me to a notary seal me there
 your single bond and in a merry sport
 if you repay me not on such a day
 in such a place such sum or sums as are
 express'd in the condition let the forfeit
 be nominated for an equal pound
 of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
 in what part of your body pleaseth me
antonio content i faith i'll seal to such a bond
 and say there is much kindness in the jew
bassanio you shall not seal to such a bond for me
 i'll rather dwell in my necessity
antonio why fear not man i will not forfeit it
 within these two months that's a month before
 this bond expires i do expect return
 of thrice three times the value of this bond
shylock o father abram what these christians are
 whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
 the thoughts of others pray you tell me this
 if he should break his day what should i gain
 by the exaction of the forfeiture
 a pound of man's flesh taken from a man
 is not so estimable profitable neither
 as flesh of muttons beefs or goats i say
 to buy his favour i extend this friendship
 if he will take it so if not adieu
 and for my love i pray you wrong me not
antonio yes shylock i will seal unto this bond
shylock then meet me forthwith at the notary's
 give him direction for this merry bond
 and i will go and purse the ducats straight
 see to my house left in the fearful guard
 of an unthrifty knave and presently
 i will be with you
antonio hie thee gentle jew
 exit shylock
 the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind
bassanio i like not fair terms and a villain's mind

 by nice direction of a maiden's eyes
 besides the lottery of my destiny
 bars me the right of voluntary choosing
 but if my father had not scanted me
 and hedged me by his wit to yield myself
 his wife who wins me by that means i told you
 yourself renowned prince then stood as fair
 as any comer i have look'd on yet
 for my affection
morocco even for that i thank you
 therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets
 to try my fortune by this scimitar
 that slew the sophy and a persian prince
 that won three fields of sultan solyman
 i would outstare the sternest eyes that look
 outbrave the heart most daring on the earth
 pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear
 yea mock the lion when he roars for prey
 to win thee lady but alas the while
 if hercules and lichas play at dice
 which is the better man the greater throw
 may turn by fortune from the weaker hand
 so is alcides beaten by his page
 and so may i blind fortune leading me
 miss that which one unworthier may attain
 and die with grieving
portia you must take your chance
 and either not attempt to choose at all
 or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
 never to speak to lady afterward
 in way of marriage therefore be advised

 thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior

scene vi the same
 enter gratiano and salarino masqued
gratiano this is the penthouse under which lorenzo
 desired us to make stand
salarino his hour is almost past
gratiano and it is marvel he outdwells his hour
 for lovers ever run before the clock
salarino o ten times faster venus pigeons fly
 to seal love's bonds newmade than they are wont
 to keep obliged faith unforfeited
gratiano that ever holds who riseth from a feast
 with that keen appetite that he sits down
 where is the horse that doth untread again
 his tedious measures with the unbated fire
 that he did pace them first all things that are
 are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd
 how like a younker or a prodigal
 the scarfed bark puts from her native bay
 hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind
 how like the prodigal doth she return
 with overweather'd ribs and ragged sails
 lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind
salarino here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter
 enter lorenzo
lorenzo sweet friends your patience for my long abode
 not i but my affairs have made you wait
 when you shall please to play the thieves for wives
 i'll watch as long for you then approach

 for who love i so much and now who knows
 but you lorenzo whether i am yours
lorenzo heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
jessica here catch this casket it is worth the pains
 i am glad tis night you do not look on me
 for i am much ashamed of my exchange
 but love is blind and lovers cannot see
 the pretty follies that themselves commit
 for if they could cupid himself would blush
 to see me thus transformed to a boy
lorenzo descend for you must be my torchbearer
jessica what must i hold a candle to my shames
 they in themselves goodsooth are too too light
 why tis an office of discovery love
 and i should be obscured
lorenzo so are you sweet
 even in the lovely garnish of a boy
 but come at once
 for the close night doth play the runaway
 and we are stay'd for at bassanio's feast
jessica i will make fast the doors and gild myself
 with some more ducats and be with you straight
 exit above
gratiano now by my hood a gentile and no jew
lorenzo beshrew me but i love her heartily
 for she is wise if i can judge of her

scene vii belmont a room in portia's house
 flourish of cornets enter portia with the
 prince of morocco and their trains
portia go draw aside the curtains and discover
 the several caskets to this noble prince
 now make your choice
morocco the first of gold who this inscription bears
 who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
 the second silver which this promise carries
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 this third dull lead with warning all as blunt
 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 how shall i know if i do choose the right
portia the one of them contains my picture prince
 if you choose that then i am yours withal
morocco some god direct my judgment let me see
 i will survey the inscriptions back again
 what says this leaden casket
 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 must give for what for lead hazard for lead
 this casket threatens men that hazard all
 do it in hope of fair advantages
 a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
 i'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
 what says the silver with her virgin hue
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 as much as he deserves pause there morocco
 and weigh thy value with an even hand
 if thou be'st rated by thy estimation
 thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
 may not extend so far as to the lady
 and yet to be afeard of my deserving
 were but a weak disabling of myself
 as much as i deserve why that's the lady
 i do in birth deserve her and in fortunes
 in graces and in qualities of breeding
 but more than these in love i do deserve
 what if i stray'd no further but chose here
 let's see once more this saying graved in gold
 who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
 why that's the lady all the world desires her
 from the four corners of the earth they come
 to kiss this shrine this mortalbreathing saint
 the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
 of wide arabia are as thoroughfares now
 for princes to come view fair portia
 the watery kingdom whose ambitious head
 spits in the face of heaven is no bar
 to stop the foreign spirits but they come
 as o'er a brook to see fair portia
 one of these three contains her heavenly picture
 is't like that lead contains her twere damnation
 to think so base a thought it were too gross
 to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
 or shall i think in silver she's immured
 being ten times undervalued to tried gold
 o sinful thought never so rich a gem
 was set in worse than gold they have in england
 a coin that bears the figure of an angel
 stamped in gold but that's insculp'd upon
 but here an angel in a golden bed
 lies all within deliver me the key
 here do i choose and thrive i as i may
portia there take it prince and if my form lie there
 then i am yours
 he unlocks the golden casket
morocco o hell what have we here
 a carrion death within whose empty eye
 there is a written scroll i'll read the writing
 reads
 all that glitters is not gold
 often have you heard that told
 many a man his life hath sold
 but my outside to behold
 gilded tombs do worms enfold
 had you been as wise as bold
 young in limbs in judgment old
 your answer had not been inscroll'd
 fare you well your suit is cold
 cold indeed and labour lost
 then farewell heat and welcome frost
 portia adieu i have too grieved a heart
 to take a tedious leave thus losers part
 exit with his train flourish of cornets
portia a gentle riddance draw the curtains go
 let all of his complexion choose me so

scene viii venice a street
 enter salarino and salanio
salarino why man i saw bassanio under sail
 with him is gratiano gone along
 and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not
salanio the villain jew with outcries raised the duke
 who went with him to search bassanio's ship
salarino he came too late the ship was under sail
 but there the duke was given to understand
 that in a gondola were seen together
 lorenzo and his amorous jessica
 besides antonio certified the duke
 they were not with bassanio in his ship
salanio i never heard a passion so confused
 so strange outrageous and so variable
 as the dog jew did utter in the streets
 my daughter o my ducats o my daughter
 fled with a christian o my christian ducats
 justice the law my ducats and my daughter
 a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
 of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter
 and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones
 stolen by my daughter justice find the girl
 she hath the stones upon her and the ducats'
salarino why all the boys in venice follow him
 crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
salanio let good antonio look he keep his day
 or he shall pay for this
salarino marry well remember'd
 i reason'd with a frenchman yesterday
 who told me in the narrow seas that part
 the french and english there miscarried
 a vessel of our country richly fraught
 i thought upon antonio when he told me
 and wish'd in silence that it were not his
salanio you were best to tell antonio what you hear
 yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
salarino a kinder gentleman treads not the earth
 i saw bassanio and antonio part
 bassanio told him he would make some speed
 of his return he answer'd do not so
 slubber not business for my sake bassanio
 but stay the very riping of the time
 and for the jew's bond which he hath of me
 let it not enter in your mind of love
 be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
 to courtship and such fair ostents of love
 as shall conveniently become you there'
 and even there his eye being big with tears
 turning his face he put his hand behind him
 and with affection wondrous sensible
 he wrung bassanio's hand and so they parted
salanio i think he only loves the world for him
 i pray thee let us go and find him out
 and quicken his embraced heaviness
 with some delight or other
salarino do we so

 and comes to his election presently
 flourish of cornets enter the prince of arragon
 portia and their trains
portia behold there stand the caskets noble prince
 if you choose that wherein i am contain'd
 straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized
 but if you fail without more speech my lord
 you must be gone from hence immediately
arragon i am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things
 first never to unfold to any one
 which casket twas i chose next if i fail
 of the right casket never in my life
 to woo a maid in way of marriage lastly
 if i do fail in fortune of my choice
 immediately to leave you and be gone
portia to these injunctions every one doth swear
 that comes to hazard for my worthless self
arragon and so have i address'd me fortune now
 to my heart's hope gold silver and base lead
 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard
 what says the golden chest ha let me see
 who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
 what many men desire that many may be meant
 by the fool multitude that choose by show
 not learning more than the fond eye doth teach
 which pries not to the interior but like the martlet
 builds in the weather on the outward wall
 even in the force and road of casualty
 i will not choose what many men desire
 because i will not jump with common spirits
 and rank me with the barbarous multitudes
 why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse
 tell me once more what title thou dost bear
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 and well said too for who shall go about
 to cozen fortune and be honourable
 without the stamp of merit let none presume
 to wear an undeserved dignity
 o that estates degrees and offices
 were not derived corruptly and that clear honour
 were purchased by the merit of the wearer
 how many then should cover that stand bare
 how many be commanded that command
 how much low peasantry would then be glean'd
 from the true seed of honour and how much honour
 pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
 to be newvarnish'd well but to my choice
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 i will assume desert give me a key for this
 and instantly unlock my fortunes here
 he opens the silver casket
portia too long a pause for that which you find there
arragon what's here the portrait of a blinking idiot
 presenting me a schedule i will read it
 how much unlike art thou to portia
 how much unlike my hopes and my deservings
 who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves'
 did i deserve no more than a fool's head
 is that my prize are my deserts no better
portia to offend and judge are distinct offices
 and of opposed natures
arragon what is here
 reads
 the fire seven times tried this
 seven times tried that judgment is
 that did never choose amiss
 some there be that shadows kiss
 such have but a shadow's bliss
 there be fools alive i wis
 silver'd o'er and so was this
 take what wife you will to bed
 i will ever be your head
 so be gone you are sped
 still more fool i shall appear
 by the time i linger here
 with one fool's head i came to woo
 but i go away with two
 sweet adieu i'll keep my oath
 patiently to bear my wroth
 exeunt arragon and train

salarino why yet it lives there uncheck'd that antonio hath
 a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas
 the goodwins i think they call the place a very
 dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many
 a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip
 report be an honest woman of her word
salanio i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
 knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
 wept for the death of a third husband but it is
 true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
 plain highway of talk that the good antonio the
 honest antonioo that i had a title good enough
 to keep his name company
salarino come the full stop
salanio ha what sayest thou why the end is he hath
 lost a ship
salarino i would it might prove the end of his losses
salanio let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my
 prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a jew
 enter shylock
 how now shylock what news among the merchants
shylock you know none so well none so well as you of my
 daughter's flight
salarino that's certain i for my part knew the tailor
 that made the wings she flew withal
salanio and shylock for his own part knew the bird was
 fledged and then it is the complexion of them all
 to leave the dam
shylock she is damned for it
salanio that's certain if the devil may be her judge
shylock my own flesh and blood to rebel
salanio out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years
shylock i say my daughter is my flesh and blood
salarino there is more difference between thy flesh and hers
 than between jet and ivory more between your bloods
 than there is between red wine and rhenish but
 tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any
 loss at sea or no
shylock there i have another bad match a bankrupt a
 prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the
 rialto a beggar that was used to come so smug upon
 the mart let him look to his bond he was wont to
 call me usurer let him look to his bond he was
 wont to lend money for a christian courtesy let him
 look to his bond
salarino why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take
 his flesh what's that good for
shylock to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else
 it will feed my revenge he hath disgraced me and
 hindered me half a million laughed at my losses
 mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my
 bargains cooled my friends heated mine
 enemies and what's his reason i am a jew hath
 not a jew eyes hath not a jew hands organs
 dimensions senses affections passions fed with
 the same food hurt with the same weapons subject
 to the same diseases healed by the same means
 warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as
 a christian is if you prick us do we not bleed
 if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison
 us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not
 revenge if we are like you in the rest we will
 resemble you in that if a jew wrong a christian
 what is his humility revenge if a christian
 wrong a jew what should his sufferance be by
 christian example why revenge the villany you
 teach me i will execute and it shall go hard but i
 will better the instruction

act iii
scene ii belmont a room in portia's house
 enter bassanio portia gratiano nerissa and
 attendants
portia i pray you tarry pause a day or two
 before you hazard for in choosing wrong
 i lose your company therefore forbear awhile
 there's something tells me but it is not love
 i would not lose you and you know yourself
 hate counsels not in such a quality
 but lest you should not understand me well
 and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
 i would detain you here some month or two
 before you venture for me i could teach you
 how to choose right but i am then forsworn
 so will i never be so may you miss me
 but if you do you'll make me wish a sin
 that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes
 they have o'erlook'd me and divided me
 one half of me is yours the other half yours
 mine own i would say but if mine then yours
 and so all yours o these naughty times
 put bars between the owners and their rights
 and so though yours not yours prove it so
 let fortune go to hell for it not i
 i speak too long but tis to peize the time
 to eke it and to draw it out in length
 to stay you from election
bassanio let me choose
 for as i am i live upon the rack
portia upon the rack bassanio then confess
 what treason there is mingled with your love
bassanio none but that ugly treason of mistrust
 which makes me fear the enjoying of my love
 there may as well be amity and life
 tween snow and fire as treason and my love
portia ay but i fear you speak upon the rack
 where men enforced do speak anything
bassanio promise me life and i'll confess the truth
portia well then confess and live
bassanio confess and love'
 had been the very sum of my confession
 o happy torment when my torturer
 doth teach me answers for deliverance
 but let me to my fortune and the caskets
portia away then i am lock'd in one of them
 if you do love me you will find me out
 nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
 let music sound while he doth make his choice
 then if he lose he makes a swanlike end
 fading in music that the comparison
 may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
 and watery deathbed for him he may win
 and what is music then then music is
 even as the flourish when true subjects bow
 to a newcrowned monarch such it is
 as are those dulcet sounds in break of day
 that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
 and summon him to marriage now he goes
 with no less presence but with much more love
 than young alcides when he did redeem
 the virgin tribute paid by howling troy
 to the seamonster i stand for sacrifice
 the rest aloof are the dardanian wives
 with bleared visages come forth to view
 the issue of the exploit go hercules
 live thou i live with much much more dismay
 i view the fight than thou that makest the fray
 music whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself
 
 song
 tell me where is fancy bred
 or in the heart or in the head
 how begot how nourished
 reply reply
 it is engender'd in the eyes
 with gazing fed and fancy dies
 in the cradle where it lies
 let us all ring fancy's knell
 i'll begin itding dong bell
all ding dong bell
bassanio so may the outward shows be least themselves
 the world is still deceived with ornament
 in law what plea so tainted and corrupt
 but being seasoned with a gracious voice
 obscures the show of evil in religion
 what damned error but some sober brow
 will bless it and approve it with a text
 hiding the grossness with fair ornament
 there is no vice so simple but assumes
 some mark of virtue on his outward parts
 how many cowards whose hearts are all as false
 as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
 the beards of hercules and frowning mars
 who inward search'd have livers white as milk
 and these assume but valour's excrement
 to render them redoubted look on beauty
 and you shall see tis purchased by the weight
 which therein works a miracle in nature
 making them lightest that wear most of it
 so are those crisped snaky golden locks
 which make such wanton gambols with the wind
 upon supposed fairness often known
 to be the dowry of a second head
 the skull that bred them in the sepulchre
 thus ornament is but the guiled shore
 to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
 veiling an indian beauty in a word
 the seeming truth which cunning times put on
 to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold
 hard food for midas i will none of thee
 nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
 tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead
 which rather threatenest than dost promise aught
 thy paleness moves me more than eloquence
 and here choose i joy be the consequence
portia aside how all the other passions fleet to air
 as doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair
 and shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy o love
 be moderate allay thy ecstasy
 in measure rein thy joy scant this excess
 i feel too much thy blessing make it less
 for fear i surfeit
bassanio what find i here
 opening the leaden casket
 fair portia's counterfeit what demigod
 hath come so near creation move these eyes
 or whether riding on the balls of mine
 seem they in motion here are sever'd lips
 parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
 should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs
 the painter plays the spider and hath woven
 a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men
 faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes
 how could he see to do them having made one
 methinks it should have power to steal both his
 and leave itself unfurnish'd yet look how far
 the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
 in underprizing it so far this shadow
 doth limp behind the substance here's the scroll
 the continent and summary of my fortune
 reads
 you that choose not by the view
 chance as fair and choose as true
 since this fortune falls to you
 be content and seek no new
 if you be well pleased with this
 and hold your fortune for your bliss
 turn you where your lady is
 and claim her with a loving kiss
 a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave
 i come by note to give and to receive
 like one of two contending in a prize
 that thinks he hath done well in people's eyes
 hearing applause and universal shout
 giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
 whether these pearls of praise be his or no
 so thrice fair lady stand i even so
 as doubtful whether what i see be true
 until confirm'd sign'd ratified by you
portia you see me lord bassanio where i stand
 such as i am though for myself alone
 i would not be ambitious in my wish
 to wish myself much better yet for you
 i would be trebled twenty times myself
 a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
 that only to stand high in your account
 i might in virtue beauties livings friends
 exceed account but the full sum of me
 is sum of something which to term in gross
 is an unlesson'd girl unschool'd unpractised
 happy in this she is not yet so old
 but she may learn happier than this
 she is not bred so dull but she can learn
 happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
 commits itself to yours to be directed
 as from her lord her governor her king
 myself and what is mine to you and yours
 is now converted but now i was the lord
 of this fair mansion master of my servants
 queen o'er myself and even now but now
 this house these servants and this same myself
 are yours my lord i give them with this ring
 which when you part from lose or give away
 let it presage the ruin of your love
 and be my vantage to exclaim on you
bassanio madam you have bereft me of all words
 only my blood speaks to you in my veins
 and there is such confusion in my powers
 as after some oration fairly spoke
 by a beloved prince there doth appear
 among the buzzing pleased multitude
 where every something being blent together
 turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
 express'd and not express'd but when this ring
 parts from this finger then parts life from hence
 o then be bold to say bassanio's dead
nerissa my lord and lady it is now our time
 that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper
 to cry good joy good joy my lord and lady
gratiano my lord bassanio and my gentle lady
 i wish you all the joy that you can wish
 for i am sure you can wish none from me
 and when your honours mean to solemnize
 the bargain of your faith i do beseech you
 even at that time i may be married too
bassanio with all my heart so thou canst get a wife
gratiano i thank your lordship you have got me one
 my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
 you saw the mistress i beheld the maid
 you loved i loved for intermission
 no more pertains to me my lord than you
 your fortune stood upon the casket there
 and so did mine too as the matter falls
 for wooing here until i sweat again
 and sweating until my very roof was dry
 with oaths of love at last if promise last
 i got a promise of this fair one here
 to have her love provided that your fortune
 achieved her mistress
portia is this true nerissa
nerissa madam it is so you stand pleased withal
bassanio and do you gratiano mean good faith
gratiano yes faith my lord
bassanio our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage
gratiano we'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats
nerissa what and stake down
gratiano no we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down
 but who comes here lorenzo and his infidel what
 and my old venetian friend salerio
 enter lorenzo jessica and salerio a messenger
 from venice
bassanio lorenzo and salerio welcome hither
 if that the youth of my new interest here
 have power to bid you welcome by your leave
 i bid my very friends and countrymen
 sweet portia welcome
portia so do i my lord
 they are entirely welcome
lorenzo i thank your honour for my part my lord
 my purpose was not to have seen you here
 but meeting with salerio by the way
 he did entreat me past all saying nay
 to come with him along
salerio i did my lord
 and i have reason for it signior antonio
 commends him to you
 gives bassanio a letter
bassanio ere i ope his letter
 i pray you tell me how my good friend doth
salerio not sick my lord unless it be in mind
 nor well unless in mind his letter there
 will show you his estate
gratiano nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome
 your hand salerio what's the news from venice
 how doth that royal merchant good antonio
 i know he will be glad of our success
 we are the jasons we have won the fleece
salerio i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
portia there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper
 that steals the colour from bassanio's cheek
 some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
 could turn so much the constitution
 of any constant man what worse and worse
 with leave bassanio i am half yourself
 and i must freely have the half of anything
 that this same paper brings you
bassanio o sweet portia
 here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
 that ever blotted paper gentle lady
 when i did first impart my love to you
 i freely told you all the wealth i had
 ran in my veins i was a gentleman
 and then i told you true and yet dear lady
 rating myself at nothing you shall see
 how much i was a braggart when i told you
 my state was nothing i should then have told you
 that i was worse than nothing for indeed
 i have engaged myself to a dear friend
 engaged my friend to his mere enemy
 to feed my means here is a letter lady
 the paper as the body of my friend
 and every word in it a gaping wound
 issuing lifeblood but is it true salerio
 have all his ventures fail'd what not one hit
 from tripolis from mexico and england
 from lisbon barbary and india
 and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
 of merchantmarring rocks
salerio not one my lord
 besides it should appear that if he had
 the present money to discharge the jew
 he would not take it never did i know
 a creature that did bear the shape of man
 so keen and greedy to confound a man
 he plies the duke at morning and at night
 and doth impeach the freedom of the state
 if they deny him justice twenty merchants
 the duke himself and the magnificoes
 of greatest port have all persuaded with him
 but none can drive him from the envious plea
 of forfeiture of justice and his bond
jessica when i was with him i have heard him swear
 to tubal and to chus his countrymen
 that he would rather have antonio's flesh
 than twenty times the value of the sum
 that he did owe him and i know my lord
 if law authority and power deny not
 it will go hard with poor antonio
portia is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
bassanio the dearest friend to me the kindest man
 the bestcondition'd and unwearied spirit
 in doing courtesies and one in whom
 the ancient roman honour more appears
 than any that draws breath in italy
portia what sum owes he the jew
bassanio for me three thousand ducats
portia what no more
 pay him six thousand and deface the bond
 double six thousand and then treble that
 before a friend of this description
 shall lose a hair through bassanio's fault
 first go with me to church and call me wife
 and then away to venice to your friend
 for never shall you lie by portia's side
 with an unquiet soul you shall have gold
 to pay the petty debt twenty times over
 when it is paid bring your true friend along
 my maid nerissa and myself meantime
 will live as maids and widows come away
 for you shall hence upon your weddingday
 bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
 since you are dear bought i will love you dear
 but let me hear the letter of your friend
bassanio reads sweet bassanio my ships have all
 miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is
 very low my bond to the jew is forfeit and since
 in paying it it is impossible i should live all
 debts are cleared between you and i if i might but
 see you at my death notwithstanding use your
 pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come
 let not my letter
portia o love dispatch all business and be gone
bassanio since i have your good leave to go away
 i will make haste but till i come again
 no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay
 no rest be interposer twixt us twain

shylock gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy
 this is the fool that lent out money gratis
 gaoler look to him
antonio hear me yet good shylock
shylock i'll have my bond speak not against my bond
 i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond
 thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause
 but since i am a dog beware my fangs
 the duke shall grant me justice i do wonder
 thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
 to come abroad with him at his request
antonio i pray thee hear me speak
shylock i'll have my bond i will not hear thee speak
 i'll have my bond and therefore speak no more
 i'll not be made a soft and dulleyed fool
 to shake the head relent and sigh and yield
 to christian intercessors follow not
 i'll have no speaking i will have my bond
 exit
salarino it is the most impenetrable cur
 that ever kept with men
antonio let him alone
 i'll follow him no more with bootless prayers
 he seeks my life his reason well i know
 i oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
 many that have at times made moan to me
 therefore he hates me
salarino i am sure the duke
 will never grant this forfeiture to hold
antonio the duke cannot deny the course of law
 for the commodity that strangers have
 with us in venice if it be denied
 will much impeach the justice of his state
 since that the trade and profit of the city
 consisteth of all nations therefore go
 these griefs and losses have so bated me
 that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
 tomorrow to my bloody creditor
 well gaoler on pray god bassanio come
 to see me pay his debt and then i care not

 enter portia nerissa lorenzo jessica and
 balthasar
lorenzo madam although i speak it in your presence
 you have a noble and a true conceit
 of godlike amity which appears most strongly
 in bearing thus the absence of your lord
 but if you knew to whom you show this honour
 how true a gentleman you send relief
 how dear a lover of my lord your husband
 i know you would be prouder of the work
 than customary bounty can enforce you
portia i never did repent for doing good
 nor shall not now for in companions
 that do converse and waste the time together
 whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love
 there must be needs a like proportion
 of lineaments of manners and of spirit
 which makes me think that this antonio
 being the bosom lover of my lord
 must needs be like my lord if it be so
 how little is the cost i have bestow'd
 in purchasing the semblance of my soul
 from out the state of hellish misery
 this comes too near the praising of myself
 therefore no more of it hear other things
 lorenzo i commit into your hands
 the husbandry and manage of my house
 until my lord's return for mine own part
 i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
 to live in prayer and contemplation
 only attended by nerissa here
 until her husband and my lord's return
 there is a monastery two miles off
 and there will we abide i do desire you
 not to deny this imposition
 the which my love and some necessity
 now lays upon you
lorenzo madam with all my heart
 i shall obey you in all fair commands
portia my people do already know my mind
 and will acknowledge you and jessica
 in place of lord bassanio and myself
 and so farewell till we shall meet again
lorenzo fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
jessica i wish your ladyship all heart's content
portia i thank you for your wish and am well pleased
 to wish it back on you fare you well jessica

 now balthasar
 as i have ever found thee honesttrue
 so let me find thee still take this same letter
 and use thou all the endeavour of a man
 in speed to padua see thou render this
 into my cousin's hand doctor bellario
 and look what notes and garments he doth give thee
 bring them i pray thee with imagined speed
 unto the tranect to the common ferry
 which trades to venice waste no time in words
 but get thee gone i shall be there before thee
balthasar madam i go with all convenient speed
 exit
portia come on nerissa i have work in hand
 that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands
 before they think of us
nerissa shall they see us
portia they shall nerissa but in such a habit
 that they shall think we are accomplished
 with that we lack i'll hold thee any wager
 when we are both accoutred like young men
 i'll prove the prettier fellow of the two
 and wear my dagger with the braver grace
 and speak between the change of man and boy
 with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
 into a manly stride and speak of frays
 like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
 how honourable ladies sought my love
 which i denying they fell sick and died
 i could not do withal then i'll repent
 and wish for all that that i had not killed them
 and twenty of these puny lies i'll tell
 that men shall swear i have discontinued school
 above a twelvemonth i have within my mind
 a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks
 which i will practise
nerissa why shall we turn to men
portia fie what a question's that
 if thou wert near a lewd interpreter
 but come i'll tell thee all my whole device
 when i am in my coach which stays for us
 at the park gate and therefore haste away

launcelot yes truly for look you the sins of the father
 are to be laid upon the children therefore i
 promise ye i fear you i was always plain with
 you and so now i speak my agitation of the matter
 therefore be of good cheer for truly i think you
 are damned there is but one hope in it that can do
 you any good and that is but a kind of bastard
 hope neither
jessica and what hope is that i pray thee
launcelot marry you may partly hope that your father got you
 not that you are not the jew's daughter
jessica that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the
 sins of my mother should be visited upon me
launcelot truly then i fear you are damned both by father and
 mother thus when i shun scylla your father i
 fall into charybdis your mother well you are
 gone both ways
jessica i shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a
 christian
launcelot truly the more to blame he we were christians
 enow before e'en as many as could well live one by
 another this making christians will raise the
 price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we
 shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money
 enter lorenzo
jessica i'll tell my husband launcelot what you say here he comes
lorenzo i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelot if
 you thus get my wife into corners
jessica nay you need not fear us lorenzo launcelot and i
 are out he tells me flatly there is no mercy for
 me in heaven because i am a jew's daughter and he
 says you are no good member of the commonwealth
 for in converting jews to christians you raise the
 price of pork
lorenzo i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
 you can the getting up of the negro's belly the
 moor is with child by you launcelot
launcelot it is much that the moor should be more than reason
 but if she be less than an honest woman she is
 indeed more than i took her for
lorenzo how every fool can play upon the word i think the
 best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence
 and discourse grow commendable in none only but
 parrots go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner
launcelot that is done sir they have all stomachs
lorenzo goodly lord what a witsnapper are you then bid
 them prepare dinner
launcelot that is done too sir only cover is the word
lorenzo will you cover then sir
launcelot not so sir neither i know my duty
lorenzo yet more quarrelling with occasion wilt thou show
 the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant i pray
 tree understand a plain man in his plain meaning
 go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve
 in the meat and we will come in to dinner
launcelot for the table sir it shall be served in for the
 meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in
 to dinner sir why let it be as humours and
 conceits shall govern
 exit
lorenzo o dear discretion how his words are suited
 the fool hath planted in his memory
 an army of good words and i do know
 a many fools that stand in better place
 garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word
 defy the matter how cheerest thou jessica
 and now good sweet say thy opinion
 how dost thou like the lord bassanio's wife
jessica past all expressing it is very meet
 the lord bassanio live an upright life
 for having such a blessing in his lady
 he finds the joys of heaven here on earth
 and if on earth he do not mean it then
 in reason he should never come to heaven
 why if two gods should play some heavenly match
 and on the wager lay two earthly women
 and portia one there must be something else
 pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world
 hath not her fellow
lorenzo even such a husband
 hast thou of me as she is for a wife
jessica nay but ask my opinion too of that
lorenzo i will anon first let us go to dinner

act iv
scene i venice a court of justice
 enter the duke the magnificoes antonio bassanio
 gratiano salerio and others
duke what is antonio here
antonio ready so please your grace
duke i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer
 a stony adversary an inhuman wretch
 uncapable of pity void and empty
 from any dram of mercy
antonio i have heard
 your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
 his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
 and that no lawful means can carry me
 out of his envy's reach i do oppose
 my patience to his fury and am arm'd
 to suffer with a quietness of spirit
 the very tyranny and rage of his
duke go one and call the jew into the court
salerio he is ready at the door he comes my lord
 enter shylock
duke make room and let him stand before our face
 shylock the world thinks and i think so too
 that thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
 to the last hour of act and then tis thought
 thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
 than is thy strange apparent cruelty
 and where thou now exact'st the penalty
 which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh
 thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
 but touch'd with human gentleness and love
 forgive a moiety of the principal
 glancing an eye of pity on his losses
 that have of late so huddled on his back
 enow to press a royal merchant down
 and pluck commiseration of his state
 from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
 from stubborn turks and tartars never train'd
 to offices of tender courtesy
 we all expect a gentle answer jew
shylock i have possess'd your grace of what i purpose
 and by our holy sabbath have i sworn
 to have the due and forfeit of my bond
 if you deny it let the danger light
 upon your charter and your city's freedom
 you'll ask me why i rather choose to have
 a weight of carrion flesh than to receive
 three thousand ducats i'll not answer that
 but say it is my humour is it answer'd
 what if my house be troubled with a rat
 and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
 to have it baned what are you answer'd yet
 some men there are love not a gaping pig
 some that are mad if they behold a cat
 and others when the bagpipe sings i the nose
 cannot contain their urine for affection
 mistress of passion sways it to the mood
 of what it likes or loathes now for your answer
 as there is no firm reason to be render'd
 why he cannot abide a gaping pig
 why he a harmless necessary cat
 why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
 must yield to such inevitable shame
 as to offend himself being offended
 so can i give no reason nor i will not
 more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
 i bear antonio that i follow thus
 a losing suit against him are you answer'd
bassanio this is no answer thou unfeeling man
 to excuse the current of thy cruelty
shylock i am not bound to please thee with my answers
bassanio do all men kill the things they do not love
shylock hates any man the thing he would not kill
bassanio every offence is not a hate at first
shylock what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
antonio i pray you think you question with the jew
 you may as well go stand upon the beach
 and bid the main flood bate his usual height
 you may as well use question with the wolf
 why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
 you may as well forbid the mountain pines
 to wag their high tops and to make no noise
 when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven
 you may as well do anything most hard
 as seek to soften thatthan which what's harder
 his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you
 make no more offers use no farther means
 but with all brief and plain conveniency
 let me have judgment and the jew his will
bassanio for thy three thousand ducats here is six
shylock what judgment shall i dread doing
 were in six parts and every part a ducat
 i would not draw them i would have my bond
duke how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none
shylock what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong
 you have among you many a purchased slave
 which like your asses and your dogs and mules
 you use in abject and in slavish parts
 because you bought them shall i say to you
 let them be free marry them to your heirs
 why sweat they under burthens let their beds
 be made as soft as yours and let their palates
 be season'd with such viands you will answer
 the slaves are ours so do i answer you
 the pound of flesh which i demand of him
 is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it
 if you deny me fie upon your law
 there is no force in the decrees of venice
 i stand for judgment answer shall i have it
duke upon my power i may dismiss this court
 unless bellario a learned doctor
 whom i have sent for to determine this
 come here today
salerio my lord here stays without
 a messenger with letters from the doctor
 new come from padua
duke bring us the letter call the messenger
bassanio good cheer antonio what man courage yet
 the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
 ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
antonio i am a tainted wether of the flock
 meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit
 drops earliest to the ground and so let me
 you cannot better be employ'd bassanio
 than to live still and write mine epitaph
 enter nerissa dressed like a lawyer's clerk
duke came you from padua from bellario
nerissa from both my lord bellario greets your grace
 presenting a letter
bassanio why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
shylock to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
gratiano not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew
 thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can
 no not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness
 of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee
shylock no none that thou hast wit enough to make
gratiano o be thou damn'd inexecrable dog
 and for thy life let justice be accused
 thou almost makest me waver in my faith
 to hold opinion with pythagoras
 that souls of animals infuse themselves
 into the trunks of men thy currish spirit
 govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter
 even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
 and whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam
 infused itself in thee for thy desires
 are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous
shylock till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
 thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud
 repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
 to cureless ruin i stand here for law
duke this letter from bellario doth commend
 a young and learned doctor to our court
 where is he
nerissa he attendeth here hard by
 to know your answer whether you'll admit him
duke with all my heart some three or four of you
 go give him courteous conduct to this place
 meantime the court shall hear bellario's letter
clerk reads
 your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
 your letter i am very sick but in the instant that
 your messenger came in loving visitation was with
 me a young doctor of rome his name is balthasar i
 acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
 the jew and antonio the merchant we turned o'er
 many books together he is furnished with my
 opinion which bettered with his own learning the
 greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes
 with him at my importunity to fill up your grace's
 request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of
 years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
 estimation for i never knew so young a body with so
 old a head i leave him to your gracious
 acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
 commendation
duke you hear the learn'd bellario what he writes
 and here i take it is the doctor come
 enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws
 give me your hand come you from old bellario
portia i did my lord
duke you are welcome take your place
 are you acquainted with the difference
 that holds this present question in the court
portia i am informed thoroughly of the cause
 which is the merchant here and which the jew
duke antonio and old shylock both stand forth
portia is your name shylock
shylock shylock is my name
portia of a strange nature is the suit you follow
 yet in such rule that the venetian law
 cannot impugn you as you do proceed
 you stand within his danger do you not
antonio ay so he says
portia do you confess the bond
antonio i do
portia then must the jew be merciful
shylock on what compulsion must i tell me that
portia the quality of mercy is not strain'd
 it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
 upon the place beneath it is twice blest
 it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
 tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
 the throned monarch better than his crown
 his sceptre shows the force of temporal power
 the attribute to awe and majesty
 wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
 but mercy is above this sceptred sway
 it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
 it is an attribute to god himself
 and earthly power doth then show likest god's
 when mercy seasons justice therefore jew
 though justice be thy plea consider this
 that in the course of justice none of us
 should see salvation we do pray for mercy
 and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
 the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much
 to mitigate the justice of thy plea
 which if thou follow this strict court of venice
 must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there
shylock my deeds upon my head i crave the law
 the penalty and forfeit of my bond
portia is he not able to discharge the money
bassanio yes here i tender it for him in the court
 yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
 i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er
 on forfeit of my hands my head my heart
 if this will not suffice it must appear
 that malice bears down truth and i beseech you
 wrest once the law to your authority
 to do a great right do a little wrong
 and curb this cruel devil of his will
portia it must not be there is no power in venice
 can alter a decree established
 twill be recorded for a precedent
 and many an error by the same example
 will rush into the state it cannot be
shylock a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel
 o wise young judge how i do honour thee
portia i pray you let me look upon the bond
shylock here tis most reverend doctor here it is
portia shylock there's thrice thy money offer'd thee
shylock an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven
 shall i lay perjury upon my soul
 no not for venice
portia why this bond is forfeit
 and lawfully by this the jew may claim
 a pound of flesh to be by him cut off
 nearest the merchant's heart be merciful
 take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
shylock when it is paid according to the tenor
 it doth appear you are a worthy judge
 you know the law your exposition
 hath been most sound i charge you by the law
 whereof you are a welldeserving pillar
 proceed to judgment by my soul i swear
 there is no power in the tongue of man
 to alter me i stay here on my bond
antonio most heartily i do beseech the court
 to give the judgment
portia why then thus it is
 you must prepare your bosom for his knife
shylock o noble judge o excellent young man
portia for the intent and purpose of the law
 hath full relation to the penalty
 which here appeareth due upon the bond
shylock tis very true o wise and upright judge
 how much more elder art thou than thy looks
portia therefore lay bare your bosom
shylock ay his breast
 so says the bond doth it not noble judge
 nearest his heart those are the very words
portia it is so are there balance here to weigh
 the flesh
shylock i have them ready
portia have by some surgeon shylock on your charge
 to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
shylock is it so nominated in the bond
portia it is not so express'd but what of that
 twere good you do so much for charity
shylock i cannot find it tis not in the bond
portia you merchant have you any thing to say
antonio but little i am arm'd and well prepared
 give me your hand bassanio fare you well
 grieve not that i am fallen to this for you
 for herein fortune shows herself more kind
 than is her custom it is still her use
 to let the wretched man outlive his wealth
 to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
 an age of poverty from which lingering penance
 of such misery doth she cut me off
 commend me to your honourable wife
 tell her the process of antonio's end
 say how i loved you speak me fair in death
 and when the tale is told bid her be judge
 whether bassanio had not once a love
 repent but you that you shall lose your friend
 and he repents not that he pays your debt
 for if the jew do cut but deep enough
 i'll pay it presently with all my heart
bassanio antonio i am married to a wife
 which is as dear to me as life itself
 but life itself my wife and all the world
 are not with me esteem'd above thy life
 i would lose all ay sacrifice them all
 here to this devil to deliver you
portia your wife would give you little thanks for that
 if she were by to hear you make the offer
gratiano i have a wife whom i protest i love
 i would she were in heaven so she could
 entreat some power to change this currish jew
nerissa tis well you offer it behind her back
 the wish would make else an unquiet house
shylock these be the christian husbands i have a daughter
 would any of the stock of barrabas
 had been her husband rather than a christian
 aside
 we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence
portia a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine
 the court awards it and the law doth give it
shylock most rightful judge
portia and you must cut this flesh from off his breast
 the law allows it and the court awards it
shylock most learned judge a sentence come prepare
portia tarry a little there is something else
 this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
 the words expressly are a pound of flesh'
 take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
 but in the cutting it if thou dost shed
 one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods
 are by the laws of venice confiscate
 unto the state of venice
gratiano o upright judge mark jew o learned judge
shylock is that the law
portia thyself shalt see the act
 for as thou urgest justice be assured
 thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
gratiano o learned judge mark jew a learned judge
shylock i take this offer then pay the bond thrice
 and let the christian go
bassanio here is the money
portia soft
 the jew shall have all justice soft no haste
 he shall have nothing but the penalty
gratiano o jew an upright judge a learned judge
portia therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
 shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
 but just a pound of flesh if thou cut'st more
 or less than a just pound be it but so much
 as makes it light or heavy in the substance
 or the division of the twentieth part
 of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
 but in the estimation of a hair
 thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
gratiano a second daniel a daniel jew
 now infidel i have you on the hip
portia why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture
shylock give me my principal and let me go
bassanio i have it ready for thee here it is
portia he hath refused it in the open court
 he shall have merely justice and his bond
gratiano a daniel still say i a second daniel
 i thank thee jew for teaching me that word
shylock shall i not have barely my principal
portia thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
 to be so taken at thy peril jew
shylock why then the devil give him good of it
 i'll stay no longer question
portia tarry jew
 the law hath yet another hold on you
 it is enacted in the laws of venice
 if it be proved against an alien
 that by direct or indirect attempts
 he seek the life of any citizen
 the party gainst the which he doth contrive
 shall seize one half his goods the other half
 comes to the privy coffer of the state
 and the offender's life lies in the mercy
 of the duke only gainst all other voice
 in which predicament i say thou stand'st
 for it appears by manifest proceeding
 that indirectly and directly too
 thou hast contrived against the very life
 of the defendant and thou hast incurr'd
 the danger formerly by me rehearsed
 down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
gratiano beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
 and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
 thou hast not left the value of a cord
 therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge
duke that thou shalt see the difference of our spirits
 i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
 for half thy wealth it is antonio's
 the other half comes to the general state
 which humbleness may drive unto a fine
portia ay for the state not for antonio
shylock nay take my life and all pardon not that
 you take my house when you do take the prop
 that doth sustain my house you take my life
 when you do take the means whereby i live
portia what mercy can you render him antonio
gratiano a halter gratis nothing else for god's sake
antonio so please my lord the duke and all the court
 to quit the fine for one half of his goods
 i am content so he will let me have
 the other half in use to render it
 upon his death unto the gentleman
 that lately stole his daughter
 two things provided more that for this favour
 he presently become a christian
 the other that he do record a gift
 here in the court of all he dies possess'd
 unto his son lorenzo and his daughter
duke he shall do this or else i do recant
 the pardon that i late pronounced here
portia art thou contented jew what dost thou say
shylock i am content
portia clerk draw a deed of gift
shylock i pray you give me leave to go from hence
 i am not well send the deed after me
 and i will sign it
duke get thee gone but do it
gratiano in christening shalt thou have two godfathers
 had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
 to bring thee to the gallows not the font

 the dearest ring in venice will i give you
 and find it out by proclamation
 only for this i pray you pardon me
portia i see sir you are liberal in offers

bassanio good sir this ring was given me by my wife

 that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it
portia that scuse serves many men to save their gifts

act v
scene i belmont avenue to portia's house
 enter lorenzo and jessica
lorenzo the moon shines bright in such a night as this
 when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
 and they did make no noise in such a night
 troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls
 and sigh'd his soul toward the grecian tents
 where cressid lay that night
jessica in such a night
 did thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
 and saw the lion's shadow ere himself
 and ran dismay'd away
lorenzo in such a night
 stood dido with a willow in her hand
 upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
 to come again to carthage
jessica in such a night
 medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
 that did renew old aeson
lorenzo in such a night
 did jessica steal from the wealthy jew
 and with an unthrift love did run from venice
 as far as belmont
jessica in such a night
 did young lorenzo swear he loved her well
 stealing her soul with many vows of faith
 and ne'er a true one
lorenzo in such a night
 did pretty jessica like a little shrew
 slander her love and he forgave it her
jessica i would outnight you did no body come
 but hark i hear the footing of a man
 enter stephano
lorenzo who comes so fast in silence of the night
stephano a friend
lorenzo a friend what friend your name i pray you friend
stephano stephano is my name and i bring word
 my mistress will before the break of day
 be here at belmont she doth stray about
 by holy crosses where she kneels and prays
 for happy wedlock hours
lorenzo who comes with her
stephano none but a holy hermit and her maid
 i pray you is my master yet return'd
lorenzo he is not nor we have not heard from him
 but go we in i pray thee jessica
 and ceremoniously let us prepare
 some welcome for the mistress of the house
 enter launcelot
launcelot sola sola wo ha ho sola sola
lorenzo who calls
launcelot sola did you see master lorenzo
 master lorenzo sola sola
lorenzo leave hollaing man here
launcelot sola where where
lorenzo here
launcelot tell him there's a post come from my master with
 his horn full of good news my master will be here
 ere morning
 exit
lorenzo sweet soul let's in and there expect their coming
 and yet no matter why should we go in
 my friend stephano signify i pray you
 within the house your mistress is at hand
 and bring your music forth into the air
 exit stephano
 how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
 here will we sit and let the sounds of music
 creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
 become the touches of sweet harmony
 sit jessica look how the floor of heaven
 is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
 there's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
 but in his motion like an angel sings
 still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins
 such harmony is in immortal souls
 but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
 doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
 enter musicians
 come ho and wake diana with a hymn
 with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear
 and draw her home with music
 music
jessica i am never merry when i hear sweet music
lorenzo the reason is your spirits are attentive
 for do but note a wild and wanton herd
 or race of youthful and unhandled colts
 fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
 which is the hot condition of their blood
 if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
 or any air of music touch their ears
 you shall perceive them make a mutual stand
 their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
 by the sweet power of music therefore the poet
 did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods
 since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
 but music for the time doth change his nature
 the man that hath no music in himself
 nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds
 is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
 the motions of his spirit are dull as night
 and his affections dark as erebus
 let no such man be trusted mark the music
 enter portia and nerissa
portia that light we see is burning in my hall
 how far that little candle throws his beams
 so shines a good deed in a naughty world
nerissa when the moon shone we did not see the candle
portia so doth the greater glory dim the less
 a substitute shines brightly as a king
 unto the king be by and then his state
 empties itself as doth an inland brook
 into the main of waters music hark
nerissa it is your music madam of the house
portia nothing is good i see without respect
 methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
nerissa silence bestows that virtue on it madam
portia the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
 when neither is attended and i think
 the nightingale if she should sing by day
 when every goose is cackling would be thought
 no better a musician than the wren
 how many things by season season'd are
 to their right praise and true perfection
 peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion
 and would not be awaked
 music ceases
lorenzo that is the voice
 or i am much deceived of portia
portia he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
 by the bad voice
lorenzo dear lady welcome home
portia we have been praying for our husbands healths
 which speed we hope the better for our words
 are they return'd
lorenzo madam they are not yet
 but there is come a messenger before
 to signify their coming
portia go in nerissa
 give order to my servants that they take
 no note at all of our being absent hence
 nor you lorenzo jessica nor you
 a tucket sounds
lorenzo your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet
 we are no telltales madam fear you not
portia this night methinks is but the daylight sick
 it looks a little paler tis a day
 such as the day is when the sun is hid
 enter bassanio antonio gratiano and
 their followers
bassanio we should hold day with the antipodes
 if you would walk in absence of the sun
portia let me give light but let me not be light
 for a light wife doth make a heavy husband
 and never be bassanio so for me
 but god sort all you are welcome home my lord
bassanio i thank you madam give welcome to my friend
 this is the man this is antonio
 to whom i am so infinitely bound
portia you should in all sense be much bound to him
 for as i hear he was much bound for you
antonio no more than i am well acquitted of
portia sir you are very welcome to our house
 it must appear in other ways than words
 therefore i scant this breathing courtesy
gratiano to nerissa by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong
 in faith i gave it to the judge's clerk
 would he were gelt that had it for my part
 since you do take it love so much at heart
portia a quarrel ho already what's the matter
gratiano about a hoop of gold a paltry ring
 that she did give me whose posy was
 for all the world like cutler's poetry
 upon a knife love me and leave me not'
nerissa what talk you of the posy or the value
 you swore to me when i did give it you
 that you would wear it till your hour of death
 and that it should lie with you in your grave
 though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
 you should have been respective and have kept it
 gave it a judge's clerk no god's my judge
 the clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it
gratiano he will an if he live to be a man
nerissa ay if a woman live to be a man
gratiano now by this hand i gave it to a youth
 a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
 no higher than thyself the judge's clerk
 a prating boy that begg'd it as a fee
 i could not for my heart deny it him
portia you were to blame i must be plain with you
 to part so slightly with your wife's first gift
 a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
 and so riveted with faith unto your flesh
 i gave my love a ring and made him swear
 never to part with it and here he stands
 i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
 nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
 that the world masters now in faith gratiano
 you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
 an twere to me i should be mad at it
bassanio aside why i were best to cut my left hand off
 and swear i lost the ring defending it
gratiano my lord bassanio gave his ring away
 unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
 deserved it too and then the boy his clerk
 that took some pains in writing he begg'd mine
 and neither man nor master would take aught
 but the two rings
portia what ring gave you my lord
 not that i hope which you received of me
bassanio if i could add a lie unto a fault
 i would deny it but you see my finger
 hath not the ring upon it it is gone
portia even so void is your false heart of truth
 by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed
 until i see the ring
nerissa nor i in yours
 till i again see mine
bassanio sweet portia
 if you did know to whom i gave the ring
 if you did know for whom i gave the ring
 and would conceive for what i gave the ring
 and how unwillingly i left the ring
 when nought would be accepted but the ring
 you would abate the strength of your displeasure
portia if you had known the virtue of the ring
 or half her worthiness that gave the ring
 or your own honour to contain the ring
 you would not then have parted with the ring
 what man is there so much unreasonable
 if you had pleased to have defended it
 with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
 to urge the thing held as a ceremony
 nerissa teaches me what to believe
 i'll die for't but some woman had the ring
bassanio no by my honour madam by my soul
 no woman had it but a civil doctor
 which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
 and begg'd the ring the which i did deny him
 and suffer'd him to go displeased away
 even he that did uphold the very life
 of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady
 i was enforced to send it after him
 i was beset with shame and courtesy
 my honour would not let ingratitude
 so much besmear it pardon me good lady
 for by these blessed candles of the night
 had you been there i think you would have begg'd
 the ring of me to give the worthy doctor
portia let not that doctor e'er come near my house
 since he hath got the jewel that i loved
 and that which you did swear to keep for me
 i will become as liberal as you
 i'll not deny him any thing i have
 no not my body nor my husband's bed
 know him i shall i am well sure of it
 lie not a night from home watch me like argus
 if you do not if i be left alone
 now by mine honour which is yet mine own
 i'll have that doctor for my bedfellow
nerissa and i his clerk therefore be well advised
 how you do leave me to mine own protection
gratiano well do you so let not me take him then
 for if i do i'll mar the young clerk's pen
antonio i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
portia sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding
bassanio portia forgive me this enforced wrong
 and in the hearing of these many friends
 i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
 wherein i see myself
portia mark you but that
 in both my eyes he doubly sees himself
 in each eye one swear by your double self
 and there's an oath of credit
bassanio nay but hear me
 pardon this fault and by my soul i swear
 i never more will break an oath with thee
antonio i once did lend my body for his wealth
 which but for him that had your husband's ring
 had quite miscarried i dare be bound again
 my soul upon the forfeit that your lord
 will never more break faith advisedly
portia then you shall be his surety give him this
 and bid him keep it better than the other
antonio here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring
bassanio by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor
portia i had it of him pardon me bassanio
 for by this ring the doctor lay with me
nerissa and pardon me my gentle gratiano
 for that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk
 in lieu of this last night did lie with me
gratiano why this is like the mending of highways
 in summer where the ways are fair enough
 what are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
portia speak not so grossly you are all amazed
 here is a letter read it at your leisure
 it comes from padua from bellario
 there you shall find that portia was the doctor
 nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here
 shall witness i set forth as soon as you
 and even but now return'd i have not yet
 enter'd my house antonio you are welcome
 and i have better news in store for you
 than you expect unseal this letter soon
 there you shall find three of your argosies
 are richly come to harbour suddenly
 you shall not know by what strange accident
 i chanced on this letter
antonio i am dumb
bassanio were you the doctor and i knew you not
gratiano were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
nerissa ay but the clerk that never means to do it
 unless he live until he be a man
bassanio sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
 when i am absent then lie with my wife
antonio sweet lady you have given me life and living
 for here i read for certain that my ships
 are safely come to road
portia how now lorenzo
 my clerk hath some good comforts too for you
nerissa ay and i'll give them him without a fee
 there do i give to you and jessica
 from the rich jew a special deed of gift
 after his death of all he dies possess'd of
lorenzo fair ladies you drop manna in the way
 of starved people
portia it is almost morning
 and yet i am sure you are not satisfied
 of these events at full let us go in
 and charge us there upon inter'gatories
 and we will answer all things faithfully
gratiano let it be so the first inter'gatory
 that my nerissa shall be sworn on is
 whether till the next night she had rather stay
 or go to bed now being two hours to day
 but were the day come i should wish it dark
 that i were couching with the doctor's clerk
 well while i live i'll fear no other thing
 so sore as keeping safe nerissa's ring
