mistress ford we burn daylight here read read perceive how i
 might be knighted i shall think the worse of fat
 men as long as i have an eye to make difference of
 men's liking and yet he would not swear praised
 women's modesty and gave such orderly and
 wellbehaved reproof to all uncomeliness that i
 would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
 the truth of his words but they do no more adhere
 and keep place together than the hundredth psalm to
 the tune of green sleeves what tempest i trow
 threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his
 belly ashore at windsor how shall i be revenged
 on him i think the best way were to entertain him
 with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted
 him in his own grease did you ever hear the like
mistress page letter for letter but that the name of page and
 ford differs to thy great comfort in this mystery
 of ill opinions here's the twinbrother of thy
 letter but let thine inherit first for i
 protest mine never shall i warrant he hath a
 thousand of these letters writ with blank space for
 different namessure moreand these are of the
 second edition he will print them out of doubt

 he would put us two i had rather be a giantess
 and lie under mount pelion well i will find you
 twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man
mistress ford why this is the very same the very hand the very
 words what doth he think of us
mistress page nay i know not it makes me almost ready to
 wrangle with mine own honesty i'll entertain
 myself like one that i am not acquainted withal

 know not myself he would never have boarded me in this fury
mistress ford boarding call you it i'll be sure to keep him
 above deck
mistress page so will i if he come under my hatches i'll never
 to sea again let's be revenged on him let's
 appoint him a meeting give him a show of comfort in
 his suit and lead him on with a finebaited delay
 till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the garter
mistress ford nay i will consent to act any villany against him
 that may not sully the chariness of our honesty o
 that my husband saw this letter it would give
 eternal food to his jealousy
mistress page why look where he comes and my good man too he's
 as far from jealousy as i am from giving him cause

 though i had never so good means as desire to make
 myself acquainted with you i shall discover a
 thing to you wherein i must very much lay open mine
 own imperfection but good sir john as you have
 one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded

 may pass with a reproof the easier sith you
 yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender
falstaff very well sir proceed
ford there is a gentlewoman in this town her husband's
 name is ford
falstaff well sir
ford i have long loved her and i protest to you
 bestowed much on her followed her with a doting
 observance engrossed opportunities to meet her
 fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
 give me sight of her not only bought many presents
 to give her but have given largely to many to know
 what she would have given briefly i have pursued
 her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the
 wing of all occasions but whatsoever i have
 merited either in my mind or in my means meed
 i am sure i have received none unless experience
 be a jewel that i have purchased at an infinite
 rate and that hath taught me to say this
 love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues
 pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues'
falstaff have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands
ford never
falstaff have you importuned her to such a purpose
ford never
falstaff of what quality was your love then
ford like a fair house built on another man's ground so
 that i have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
 where i erected it
falstaff to what purpose have you unfolded this to me
ford when i have told you that i have told you all
 some say that though she appear honest to me yet in
 other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
 there is shrewd construction made of her now sir
 john here is the heart of my purpose you are a
 gentleman of excellent breeding admirable
 discourse of great admittance authentic in your
 place and person generally allowed for your many
 warlike courtlike and learned preparations

 to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
 ford's wife use your art of wooing win her to
 consent to you if any man may you may as soon as
 any
falstaff would it apply well to the vehemency of your
 affection that i should win what you would enjoy
 methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously
ford o understand my drift she dwells so securely on
 the excellency of her honour that the folly of my
 soul dares not present itself she is too bright to
 be looked against now could i could come to her
 with any detection in my hand my desires had
 instance and argument to commend themselves i
 could drive her then from the ward of her purity
 her reputation her marriagevow and a thousand
 other her defences which now are too too strongly
 embattled against me what say you to't sir john
falstaff master brook i will first make bold with your
 money next give me your hand and last as i am a
 gentleman you shall if you will enjoy ford's wife

falstaff no master brook but the peaking cornuto her
 husband master brook dwelling in a continual
 larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our
 encounter after we had embraced kissed protested
 and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy
 and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither
 provoked and instigated by his distemper and
 forsooth to search his house for his wife's love
ford what while you were there

ford and did he search for you and could not find you
falstaff you shall hear as good luck would have it comes
 in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford's
 approach and in her invention and ford's wife's
 distraction they conveyed me into a buckbasket
ford a buckbasket

 shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy
 napkins that master brook there was the rankest
 compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril
ford and how long lay you there
falstaff nay you shall hear master brook what i have
 suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good
 being thus crammed in the basket a couple of ford's
 knaves his hinds were called forth by their
 mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
 datchetlane they took me on their shoulders met
 the jealous knave their master in the door who
 asked them once or twice what they had in their
 basket i quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave
 would have searched it but fate ordaining he
 should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he
 for a search and away went i for foul clothes but
 mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs
 of three several deaths first an intolerable
 fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
 bellwether next to be compassed like a good
 bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to
 point heel to head and then to be stopped in
 like a strong distillation with stinking clothes
 that fretted in their own grease think of thata
 man of my kidneythink of thatthat am as subject
 to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution
 and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation
 and in the height of this bath when i was more than
 half stewed in grease like a dutch dish to be
 thrown into the thames and cooled glowing hot
 in that surge like a horseshoe think of
 thathissing hotthink of that master brook
ford in good sadness i am sorry that for my sake you
 have sufferd all this my suit then is desperate
 you'll undertake her no more
falstaff master brook i will be thrown into etna as i have
 been into thames ere i will leave her thus her
 husband is this morning gone abirding i have
 received from her another embassy of meeting twixt
 eight and nine is the hour master brook
ford tis past eight already sir
falstaff is it i will then address me to my appointment
 come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall
 know how i speed and the conclusion shall be
 crowned with your enjoying her adieu you shall
 have her master brook master brook you shall

page so think i too
mistress ford devise but how you'll use him when he comes
 and let us two devise to bring him thither
mistress page there is an old tale goes that herne the hunter
 sometime a keeper here in windsor forest
 doth all the wintertime at still midnight
 walk round about an oak with great ragg'd horns
 and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
 and makes milchkine yield blood and shakes a chain
 in a most hideous and dreadful manner
 you have heard of such a spirit and well you know
 the superstitious idleheaded eld
 received and did deliver to our age
 this tale of herne the hunter for a truth
page why yet there want not many that do fear
 in deep of night to walk by this herne's oak

 and three or four more of their growth we'll dress
 like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white
 with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
 and rattles in their hands upon a sudden
 as falstaff she and i are newly met
 let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
 with some diffused song upon their sight
 we two in great amazedness will fly
 then let them all encircle him about
 and fairylike topinch the unclean knight
 and ask him why that hour of fairy revel
 in their so sacred paths he dares to tread
 in shape profane
mistress ford and till he tell the truth
 let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
 and burn him with their tapers
mistress page the truth being known
 we'll all present ourselves dishorn the spirit
 and mock him home to windsor
ford the children must
 be practised well to this or they'll ne'er do't
sir hugh evans i will teach the children their behaviors and i
 will be like a jackanapes also to burn the
 knight with my taber
ford that will be excellent i'll go and buy them vizards

 her father means she shall be all in white

 she shall go with him her mother hath intended
 the better to denote her to the doctor
 for they must all be mask'd and vizarded
 that quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed
 with ribands pendent flaring bout her head

 the maid hath given consent to go with him

egeus happy be theseus our renowned duke
theseus thanks good egeus what's the news with thee
egeus full of vexation come i with complaint
 against my child my daughter hermia
 stand forth demetrius my noble lord
 this man hath my consent to marry her
 stand forth lysander and my gracious duke
 this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child
 thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes
 and interchanged lovetokens with my child
 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
 with feigning voice verses of feigning love
 and stolen the impression of her fantasy
 with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
 knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
 of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth
 with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart
 turn'd her obedience which is due to me
 to stubborn harshness and my gracious duke
 be it so she will not here before your grace
 consent to marry with demetrius
 i beg the ancient privilege of athens
 as she is mine i may dispose of her
 which shall be either to this gentleman
 or to her death according to our law
 immediately provided in that case
theseus what say you hermia be advised fair maid
 to you your father should be as a god
 one that composed your beauties yea and one
 to whom you are but as a form in wax
 by him imprinted and within his power
 to leave the figure or disfigure it
 demetrius is a worthy gentleman
hermia so is lysander
theseus in himself he is
 but in this kind wanting your father's voice
 the other must be held the worthier
hermia i would my father look'd but with my eyes
theseus rather your eyes must with his judgment look
hermia i do entreat your grace to pardon me
 i know not by what power i am made bold
 nor how it may concern my modesty
 in such a presence here to plead my thoughts
 but i beseech your grace that i may know
 the worst that may befall me in this case
 if i refuse to wed demetrius
theseus either to die the death or to abjure
 for ever the society of men
 therefore fair hermia question your desires
 know of your youth examine well your blood
 whether if you yield not to your father's choice
 you can endure the livery of a nun
 for aye to be in shady cloister mew'd
 to live a barren sister all your life
 chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
 thriceblessed they that master so their blood
 to undergo such maiden pilgrimage
 but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
 than that which withering on the virgin thorn
 grows lives and dies in single blessedness
hermia so will i grow so live so die my lord
 ere i will my virgin patent up
 unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
 my soul consents not to give sovereignty
theseus take time to pause and by the nest new moon
 the sealingday betwixt my love and me
 for everlasting bond of fellowship
 upon that day either prepare to die
 for disobedience to your father's will
 or else to wed demetrius as he would
 or on diana's altar to protest
 for aye austerity and single life
demetrius relent sweet hermia and lysander yield
 thy crazed title to my certain right
lysander you have her father's love demetrius
 let me have hermia's do you marry him
egeus scornful lysander true he hath my love
 and what is mine my love shall render him
 and she is mine and all my right of her
 i do estate unto demetrius
lysander i am my lord as well derived as he
 as well possess'd my love is more than his
 my fortunes every way as fairly rank'd
 if not with vantage as demetrius'
 and which is more than all these boasts can be
 i am beloved of beauteous hermia
 why should not i then prosecute my right
 demetrius i'll avouch it to his head
 made love to nedar's daughter helena
 and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
 devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
 upon this spotted and inconstant man
theseus i must confess that i have heard so much
 and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
 but being overfull of selfaffairs
 my mind did lose it but demetrius come
 and come egeus you shall go with me
 i have some private schooling for you both
 for you fair hermia look you arm yourself
 to fit your fancies to your father's will
 or else the law of athens yields you up
 which by no means we may extenuate
 to death or to a vow of single life
 come my hippolyta what cheer my love
 demetrius and egeus go along
 i must employ you in some business
 against our nuptial and confer with you
 of something nearly that concerns yourselves
egeus with duty and desire we follow you
 exeunt all but lysander and hermia
lysander how now my love why is your cheek so pale
 how chance the roses there do fade so fast
hermia belike for want of rain which i could well
 beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
lysander ay me for aught that i could ever read
 could ever hear by tale or history
 the course of true love never did run smooth
 but either it was different in blood
hermia o cross too high to be enthrall'd to low
lysander or else misgraffed in respect of years
hermia o spite too old to be engaged to young
lysander or else it stood upon the choice of friends
hermia o hell to choose love by another's eyes
lysander or if there were a sympathy in choice
 war death or sickness did lay siege to it
 making it momentany as a sound
 swift as a shadow short as any dream
 brief as the lightning in the collied night
 that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
 and ere a man hath power to say behold'
 the jaws of darkness do devour it up
 so quick bright things come to confusion
hermia if then true lovers have been ever cross'd
 it stands as an edict in destiny
 then let us teach our trial patience
 because it is a customary cross
 as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
 wishes and tears poor fancy's followers
lysander a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia
 i have a widow aunt a dowager
 of great revenue and she hath no child
 from athens is her house remote seven leagues
 and she respects me as her only son
 there gentle hermia may i marry thee
 and to that place the sharp athenian law
 cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then
 steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night
 and in the wood a league without the town
 where i did meet thee once with helena
 to do observance to a morn of may
 there will i stay for thee
hermia my good lysander
 i swear to thee by cupid's strongest bow
 by his best arrow with the golden head
 by the simplicity of venus doves
 by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
 and by that fire which burn'd the carthage queen
 when the false troyan under sail was seen
 by all the vows that ever men have broke
 in number more than ever women spoke
 in that same place thou hast appointed me
 tomorrow truly will i meet with thee
lysander keep promise love look here comes helena
 enter helena
hermia god speed fair helena whither away
helena call you me fair that fair again unsay
 demetrius loves your fair o happy fair
 your eyes are lodestars and your tongue's sweet air
 more tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear
 when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
 sickness is catching o were favour so
 yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go
 my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
 my tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody
 were the world mine demetrius being bated
 the rest i'd give to be to you translated
 o teach me how you look and with what art
 you sway the motion of demetrius heart
hermia i frown upon him yet he loves me still
helena o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
hermia i give him curses yet he gives me love
helena o that my prayers could such affection move
hermia the more i hate the more he follows me
helena the more i love the more he hateth me
hermia his folly helena is no fault of mine
helena none but your beauty would that fault were mine
hermia take comfort he no more shall see my face
 lysander and myself will fly this place
 before the time i did lysander see
 seem'd athens as a paradise to me
 o then what graces in my love do dwell
 that he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell
lysander helen to you our minds we will unfold
 tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold
 her silver visage in the watery glass
 decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
 a time that lovers flights doth still conceal
 through athens gates have we devised to steal
hermia and in the wood where often you and i
 upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie
 emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
 there my lysander and myself shall meet
 and thence from athens turn away our eyes
 to seek new friends and stranger companies
 farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
 and good luck grant thee thy demetrius
 keep word lysander we must starve our sight
 from lovers food till morrow deep midnight
lysander i will my hermia
 exit hermia
 helena adieu
 as you on him demetrius dote on you
 exit
helena how happy some o'er other some can be
 through athens i am thought as fair as she
 but what of that demetrius thinks not so
 he will not know what all but he do know
 and as he errs doting on hermia's eyes
 so i admiring of his qualities
 things base and vile folding no quantity
 love can transpose to form and dignity
 love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
 and therefore is wing'd cupid painted blind
 nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste
 wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
 and therefore is love said to be a child
 because in choice he is so oft beguiled
 as waggish boys in game themselves forswear
 so the boy love is perjured every where
 for ere demetrius look'd on hermia's eyne
 he hail'd down oaths that he was only mine
 and when this hail some heat from hermia felt
 so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt
 i will go tell him of fair hermia's flight
 then to the wood will he tomorrow night
 pursue her and for this intelligence
 if i have thanks it is a dear expense
 but herein mean i to enrich my pain
 to have his sight thither and back again

 it if i do it let the audience look to their
 eyes i will move storms i will condole in some
 measure to the rest yet my chief humour is for a
 tyrant i could play ercles rarely or a part to
 tear a cat in to make all split
 the raging rocks
 and shivering shocks

 of prison gates
 and phibbus car
 shall shine from far
 and make and mar
 the foolish fates

 a midsummer night's dream
act ii
scene i a wood near athens
 enter from opposite sides a fairy and puck
puck how now spirit whither wander you
fairy over hill over dale
 thorough bush thorough brier
 over park over pale
 thorough flood thorough fire
 i do wander everywhere
 swifter than the moon's sphere
 and i serve the fairy queen
 to dew her orbs upon the green
 the cowslips tall her pensioners be
 in their gold coats spots you see
 those be rubies fairy favours
 in those freckles live their savours
 i must go seek some dewdrops here
 and hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear
 farewell thou lob of spirits i'll be gone
 our queen and all our elves come here anon
puck the king doth keep his revels here tonight
 take heed the queen come not within his sight
 for oberon is passing fell and wrath
 because that she as her attendant hath
 a lovely boy stolen from an indian king
 she never had so sweet a changeling
 and jealous oberon would have the child
 knight of his train to trace the forests wild
 but she perforce withholds the loved boy
 crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
 and now they never meet in grove or green
 by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
 but they do square that all their elves for fear
 creep into acorncups and hide them there
fairy either i mistake your shape and making quite
 or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
 call'd robin goodfellow are not you he
 that frights the maidens of the villagery
 skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
 and bootless make the breathless housewife churn
 and sometime make the drink to bear no barm
 mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm
 those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck
 you do their work and they shall have good luck
 are not you he
puck thou speak'st aright
 i am that merry wanderer of the night
 i jest to oberon and make him smile
 when i a fat and beanfed horse beguile
 neighing in likeness of a filly foal
 and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl
 in very likeness of a roasted crab
 and when she drinks against her lips i bob
 and on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale
 the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
 sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me
 then slip i from her bum down topples she
 and tailor cries and falls into a cough
 and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
 and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
 a merrier hour was never wasted there
 but room fairy here comes oberon
fairy and here my mistress would that he were gone
 enter from one side oberon with his train
 from the other titania with hers
oberon ill met by moonlight proud titania
titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence
 i have forsworn his bed and company
oberon tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord
titania then i must be thy lady but i know
 when thou hast stolen away from fairy land
 and in the shape of corin sat all day
 playing on pipes of corn and versing love
 to amorous phillida why art thou here
 come from the farthest steppe of india
 but that forsooth the bouncing amazon
 your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love
 to theseus must be wedded and you come
 to give their bed joy and prosperity
oberon how canst thou thus for shame titania
 glance at my credit with hippolyta
 knowing i know thy love to theseus
 didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
 from perigenia whom he ravished
 and make him with fair aegle break his faith
 with ariadne and antiopa
titania these are the forgeries of jealousy
 and never since the middle summer's spring
 met we on hill in dale forest or mead
 by paved fountain or by rushy brook
 or in the beached margent of the sea
 to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
 but with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport
 therefore the winds piping to us in vain
 as in revenge have suck'd up from the sea
 contagious fogs which falling in the land
 have every pelting river made so proud
 that they have overborne their continents
 the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain
 the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
 hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard
 the fold stands empty in the drowned field
 and crows are fatted with the murrion flock
 the nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud
 and the quaint mazes in the wanton green
 for lack of tread are undistinguishable
 the human mortals want their winter here
 no night is now with hymn or carol blest
 therefore the moon the governess of floods
 pale in her anger washes all the air
 that rheumatic diseases do abound
 and thorough this distemperature we see
 the seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts
 far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
 and on old hiems thin and icy crown
 an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
 is as in mockery set the spring the summer
 the childing autumn angry winter change
 their wonted liveries and the mazed world
 by their increase now knows not which is which
 and this same progeny of evils comes
 from our debate from our dissension
 we are their parents and original
oberon do you amend it then it lies in you
 why should titania cross her oberon
 i do but beg a little changeling boy
 to be my henchman
titania set your heart at rest
 the fairy land buys not the child of me
 his mother was a votaress of my order
 and in the spiced indian air by night
 full often hath she gossip'd by my side
 and sat with me on neptune's yellow sands
 marking the embarked traders on the flood
 when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
 and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind
 which she with pretty and with swimming gait
 followingher womb then rich with my young squire
 would imitate and sail upon the land
 to fetch me trifles and return again
 as from a voyage rich with merchandise
 but she being mortal of that boy did die
 and for her sake do i rear up her boy
 and for her sake i will not part with him
oberon how long within this wood intend you stay
titania perchance till after theseus weddingday
 if you will patiently dance in our round
 and see our moonlight revels go with us
 if not shun me and i will spare your haunts
oberon give me that boy and i will go with thee
titania not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away
 we shall chide downright if i longer stay
 exit titania with her train
oberon well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
 till i torment thee for this injury
 my gentle puck come hither thou rememberest
 since once i sat upon a promontory
 and heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
 uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
 that the rude sea grew civil at her song
 and certain stars shot madly from their spheres
 to hear the seamaid's music
puck i remember
oberon that very time i saw but thou couldst not
 flying between the cold moon and the earth
 cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took
 at a fair vestal throned by the west
 and loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow
 as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
 but i might see young cupid's fiery shaft
 quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon
 and the imperial votaress passed on
 in maiden meditation fancyfree
 yet mark'd i where the bolt of cupid fell
 it fell upon a little western flower
 before milkwhite now purple with love's wound
 and maidens call it loveinidleness
 fetch me that flower the herb i shew'd thee once
 the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
 will make or man or woman madly dote
 upon the next live creature that it sees
 fetch me this herb and be thou here again
 ere the leviathan can swim a league
puck i'll put a girdle round about the earth
 in forty minutes
 exit
oberon having once this juice
 i'll watch titania when she is asleep
 and drop the liquor of it in her eyes
 the next thing then she waking looks upon
 be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
 on meddling monkey or on busy ape
 she shall pursue it with the soul of love
 and ere i take this charm from off her sight
 as i can take it with another herb
 i'll make her render up her page to me
 but who comes here i am invisible
 and i will overhear their conference
 enter demetrius helena following him
demetrius i love thee not therefore pursue me not
 where is lysander and fair hermia
 the one i'll slay the other slayeth me
 thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood
 and here am i and wode within this wood
 because i cannot meet my hermia
 hence get thee gone and follow me no more
helena you draw me you hardhearted adamant
 but yet you draw not iron for my heart
 is true as steel leave you your power to draw
 and i shall have no power to follow you
demetrius do i entice you do i speak you fair
 or rather do i not in plainest truth
 tell you i do not nor i cannot love you
helena and even for that do i love you the more
 i am your spaniel and demetrius
 the more you beat me i will fawn on you
 use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
 neglect me lose me only give me leave
 unworthy as i am to follow you
 what worser place can i beg in your love
 and yet a place of high respect with me
 than to be used as you use your dog
demetrius tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
 for i am sick when i do look on thee
helena and i am sick when i look not on you
demetrius you do impeach your modesty too much
 to leave the city and commit yourself
 into the hands of one that loves you not
 to trust the opportunity of night
 and the ill counsel of a desert place
 with the rich worth of your virginity
helena your virtue is my privilege for that
 it is not night when i do see your face
 therefore i think i am not in the night
 nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
 for you in my respect are all the world
 then how can it be said i am alone
 when all the world is here to look on me
demetrius i'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
 and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
helena the wildest hath not such a heart as you
 run when you will the story shall be changed
 apollo flies and daphne holds the chase
 the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
 makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
 when cowardice pursues and valour flies
demetrius i will not stay thy questions let me go
 or if thou follow me do not believe
 but i shall do thee mischief in the wood
helena ay in the temple in the town the field
 you do me mischief fie demetrius
 your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
 we cannot fight for love as men may do
 we should be wood and were not made to woo
 exit demetrius
 i'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
 to die upon the hand i love so well
 exit
oberon fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
 thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
 reenter puck
 hast thou the flower there welcome wanderer
puck ay there it is
oberon i pray thee give it me
 i know a bank where the wild thyme blows
 where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
 quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine
 with sweet muskroses and with eglantine
 there sleeps titania sometime of the night
 lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight
 and there the snake throws her enamell'd skin
 weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
 and with the juice of this i'll streak her eyes
 and make her full of hateful fantasies
 take thou some of it and seek through this grove
 a sweet athenian lady is in love
 with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
 but do it when the next thing he espies
 may be the lady thou shalt know the man
 by the athenian garments he hath on
 effect it with some care that he may prove
 more fond on her than she upon her love
 and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
puck fear not my lord your servant shall do so

scene ii another part of the wood
 enter titania with her train
titania come now a roundel and a fairy song
 then for the third part of a minute hence
 some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds
 some war with reremice for their leathern wings
 to make my small elves coats and some keep back
 the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
 at our quaint spirits sing me now asleep
 then to your offices and let me rest
 the fairies sing
 you spotted snakes with double tongue
 thorny hedgehogs be not seen
 newts and blindworms do no wrong
 come not near our fairy queen
 philomel with melody
 sing in our sweet lullaby
 lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
 never harm
 nor spell nor charm
 come our lovely lady nigh
 so good night with lullaby
 weaving spiders come not here
 hence you longlegg'd spinners hence
 beetles black approach not near
 worm nor snail do no offence
 philomel with melody &c
fairy hence away now all is well
 one aloof stand sentinel
 exeunt fairies titania sleeps
 enter oberon and squeezes the flower on titania's eyelids
oberon what thou seest when thou dost wake
 do it for thy truelove take
 love and languish for his sake
 be it ounce or cat or bear
 pard or boar with bristled hair
 in thy eye that shall appear
 when thou wakest it is thy dear
 wake when some vile thing is near
 exit
 enter lysander and hermia
lysander fair love you faint with wandering in the wood
 and to speak troth i have forgot our way
 we'll rest us hermia if you think it good
 and tarry for the comfort of the day
hermia be it so lysander find you out a bed
 for i upon this bank will rest my head
lysander one turf shall serve as pillow for us both
 one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
hermia nay good lysander for my sake my dear
 lie further off yet do not lie so near
lysander o take the sense sweet of my innocence
 love takes the meaning in love's conference
 i mean that my heart unto yours is knit
 so that but one heart we can make of it
 two bosoms interchained with an oath
 so then two bosoms and a single troth
 then by your side no bedroom me deny
 for lying so hermia i do not lie
hermia lysander riddles very prettily
 now much beshrew my manners and my pride
 if hermia meant to say lysander lied
 but gentle friend for love and courtesy
 lie further off in human modesty
 such separation as may well be said
 becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
 so far be distant and good night sweet friend
 thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end
lysander amen amen to that fair prayer say i
 and then end life when i end loyalty
 here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
hermia with half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd
 they sleep
 enter puck
puck through the forest have i gone
 but athenian found i none
 on whose eyes i might approve
 this flower's force in stirring love
 night and silencewho is here
 weeds of athens he doth wear
 this is he my master said
 despised the athenian maid
 and here the maiden sleeping sound
 on the dank and dirty ground
 pretty soul she durst not lie
 near this lacklove this killcourtesy
 churl upon thy eyes i throw
 all the power this charm doth owe
 when thou wakest let love forbid
 sleep his seat on thy eyelid
 so awake when i am gone
 for i must now to oberon
 exit
 enter demetrius and helena running
helena stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius
demetrius i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
helena o wilt thou darkling leave me do not so
demetrius stay on thy peril i alone will go
 exit
helena o i am out of breath in this fond chase
 the more my prayer the lesser is my grace
 happy is hermia wheresoe'er she lies
 for she hath blessed and attractive eyes
 how came her eyes so bright not with salt tears
 if so my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers
 no no i am as ugly as a bear
 for beasts that meet me run away for fear
 therefore no marvel though demetrius
 do as a monster fly my presence thus
 what wicked and dissembling glass of mine
 made me compare with hermia's sphery eyne
 but who is here lysander on the ground
 dead or asleep i see no blood no wound
 lysander if you live good sir awake
lysander awaking and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake
 transparent helena nature shows art
 that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
 where is demetrius o how fit a word
 is that vile name to perish on my sword
helena do not say so lysander say not so
 what though he love your hermia lord what though
 yet hermia still loves you then be content
lysander content with hermia no i do repent
 the tedious minutes i with her have spent
 not hermia but helena i love
 who will not change a raven for a dove
 the will of man is by his reason sway'd
 and reason says you are the worthier maid
 things growing are not ripe until their season
 so i being young till now ripe not to reason
 and touching now the point of human skill
 reason becomes the marshal to my will
 and leads me to your eyes where i o'erlook
 love's stories written in love's richest book
helena wherefore was i to this keen mockery born
 when at your hands did i deserve this scorn
 is't not enough is't not enough young man
 that i did never no nor never can
 deserve a sweet look from demetrius eye
 but you must flout my insufficiency
 good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
 in such disdainful manner me to woo
 but fare you well perforce i must confess
 i thought you lord of more true gentleness
 o that a lady of one man refused
 should of another therefore be abused
 exit
lysander she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there
 and never mayst thou come lysander near
 for as a surfeit of the sweetest things
 the deepest loathing to the stomach brings
 or as tie heresies that men do leave
 are hated most of those they did deceive
 so thou my surfeit and my heresy
 of all be hated but the most of me
 and all my powers address your love and might
 to honour helen and to be her knight
 exit
hermia awaking help me lysander help me do thy best
 to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
 ay me for pity what a dream was here
 lysander look how i do quake with fear
 methought a serpent eat my heart away
 and you sat smiling at his cruel pray
 lysander what removed lysander lord
 what out of hearing gone no sound no word
 alack where are you speak an if you hear
 speak of all loves i swoon almost with fear
 no then i well perceive you all not nigh
 either death or you i'll find immediately

 enter quince snug bottom flute snout and
 starveling
bottom are we all met
quince pat pat and here's a marvellous convenient place
 for our rehearsal this green plot shall be our
 stage this hawthornbrake our tiringhouse and we
 will do it in action as we will do it before the duke
bottom peter quince
quince what sayest thou bully bottom
bottom there are things in this comedy of pyramus and
 thisby that will never please first pyramus must
 draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies
 cannot abide how answer you that
snout by'r lakin a parlous fear
starveling i believe we must leave the killing out when all is done
bottom not a whit i have a device to make all well
 write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to
 say we will do no harm with our swords and that
 pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more
 better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not
 pyramus but bottom the weaver this will put them
 out of fear
quince well we will have such a prologue and it shall be
 written in eight and six
bottom no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
snout will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
starveling i fear it i promise you
bottom masters you ought to consider with yourselves to
 bring ingod shield usa lion among ladies is a
 most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful
 wildfowl than your lion living and we ought to
 look to t
snout therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
bottom nay you must name his name and half his face must
 be seen through the lion's neck and he himself
 must speak through saying thus or to the same
 defect'ladies'or fairladiesi would wish
 you'or i would request you'or i would
 entreat younot to fear not to tremble my life
 for yours if you think i come hither as a lion it
 were pity of my life no i am no such thing i am a
 man as other men are and there indeed let him name
 his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner
quince well it shall be so but there is two hard things

snout doth the moon shine that night we play our play
bottom a calendar a calendar look in the almanac find
 out moonshine find out moonshine
quince yes it doth shine that night
bottom why then may you leave a casement of the great
 chamber window where we play open and the moon
 may shine in at the casement
quince ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
 and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to
 present the person of moonshine then there is
 another thing we must have a wall in the great
 chamber for pyramus and thisby says the story did
 talk through the chink of a wall
snout you can never bring in a wall what say you bottom
bottom some man or other must present wall and let him
 have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast
 about him to signify wall and let him hold his
 fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus
 and thisby whisper
quince if that may be then all is well come sit down
 every mother's son and rehearse your parts
 pyramus you begin when you have spoken your
 speech enter into that brake and so every one
 according to his cue

 the ousel cock so black of hue
 with orangetawny bill
 the throstle with his note so true
 the wren with little quill
titania awaking what angel wakes me from my flowery bed
bottom sings
 the finch the sparrow and the lark
 the plainsong cuckoo gray
 whose note full many a man doth mark
 and dares not answer nay
 for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish
 a bird who would give a bird the lie though he cry
 cuckoo never so
titania i pray thee gentle mortal sing again
 mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note
 so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
 and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
 on the first view to say to swear i love thee
bottom methinks mistress you should have little reason
 for that and yet to say the truth reason and
 love keep little company together nowadays the
 more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
 make them friends nay i can gleek upon occasion
titania thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
bottom not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out
 of this wood i have enough to serve mine own turn
titania out of this wood do not desire to go
 thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
 i am a spirit of no common rate
 the summer still doth tend upon my state
 and i do love thee therefore go with me
 i'll give thee fairies to attend on thee
 and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
 and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
 and i will purge thy mortal grossness so
 that thou shalt like an airy spirit go

titania be kind and courteous to this gentleman
 hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
 feed him with apricocks and dewberries
 with purple grapes green figs and mulberries
 the honeybags steal from the humblebees
 and for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs
 and light them at the fiery glowworm's eyes
 to have my love to bed and to arise
 and pluck the wings from painted butterflies
 to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
 nod to him elves and do him courtesies
peaseblossom hail mortal
cobweb hail

bottom i cry your worship's mercy heartily i beseech your
 worship's name

titania come wait upon him lead him to my bower
 the moon methinks looks with a watery eye
 and when she weeps weeps every little flower
 lamenting some enforced chastity
 tie up my love's tongue bring him silently
 exeunt
 a midsummer night's dream
act iii
scene ii another part of the wood
 enter oberon
oberon i wonder if titania be awaked
 then what it was that next came in her eye
 which she must dote on in extremity
 enter puck
 here comes my messenger
 how now mad spirit
 what nightrule now about this haunted grove
puck my mistress with a monster is in love
 near to her close and consecrated bower
 while she was in her dull and sleeping hour
 a crew of patches rude mechanicals
 that work for bread upon athenian stalls
 were met together to rehearse a play
 intended for great theseus nuptialday
 the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
 who pyramus presented in their sport
 forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
 when i did him at this advantage take
 an ass's nole i fixed on his head
 anon his thisbe must be answered
 and forth my mimic comes when they him spy
 as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
 or russetpated choughs many in sort
 rising and cawing at the gun's report
 sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
 so at his sight away his fellows fly
 and at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls
 he murder cries and help from athens calls
 their sense thus weak lost with their fears
 thus strong
 made senseless things begin to do them wrong
 for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
 some sleeves some hats from yielders all
 things catch
 i led them on in this distracted fear
 and left sweet pyramus translated there
 when in that moment so it came to pass
 titania waked and straightway loved an ass
oberon this falls out better than i could devise
 but hast thou yet latch'd the athenian's eyes
 with the lovejuice as i did bid thee do
puck i took him sleepingthat is finish'd too
 and the athenian woman by his side
 that when he waked of force she must be eyed
 enter hermia and demetrius
oberon stand close this is the same athenian
puck this is the woman but not this the man
demetrius o why rebuke you him that loves you so
 lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
hermia now i but chide but i should use thee worse
 for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse
 if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep
 being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep
 and kill me too
 the sun was not so true unto the day
 as he to me would he have stolen away
 from sleeping hermia i'll believe as soon
 this whole earth may be bored and that the moon
 may through the centre creep and so displease
 her brother's noontide with antipodes
 it cannot be but thou hast murder'd him
 so should a murderer look so dead so grim
demetrius so should the murder'd look and so should i
 pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty
 yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
 as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere
hermia what's this to my lysander where is he
 ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me
demetrius i had rather give his carcass to my hounds
hermia out dog out cur thou drivest me past the bounds
 of maiden's patience hast thou slain him then
 henceforth be never number'd among men
 o once tell true tell true even for my sake
 durst thou have look'd upon him being awake
 and hast thou kill'd him sleeping o brave touch
 could not a worm an adder do so much
 an adder did it for with doubler tongue
 than thine thou serpent never adder stung
demetrius you spend your passion on a misprised mood
 i am not guilty of lysander's blood
 nor is he dead for aught that i can tell
hermia i pray thee tell me then that he is well
demetrius an if i could what should i get therefore
hermia a privilege never to see me more
 and from thy hated presence part i so
 see me no more whether he be dead or no
 exit
demetrius there is no following her in this fierce vein
 here therefore for a while i will remain
 so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
 for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
 which now in some slight measure it will pay
 if for his tender here i make some stay
 lies down and sleeps
oberon what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
 and laid the lovejuice on some truelove's sight
 of thy misprision must perforce ensue
 some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true
puck then fate o'errules that one man holding troth
 a million fail confounding oath on oath
oberon about the wood go swifter than the wind
 and helena of athens look thou find
 all fancysick she is and pale of cheer
 with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
 by some illusion see thou bring her here
 i'll charm his eyes against she do appear
puck i go i go look how i go
 swifter than arrow from the tartar's bow
 exit
oberon flower of this purple dye
 hit with cupid's archery
 sink in apple of his eye
 when his love he doth espy
 let her shine as gloriously
 as the venus of the sky
 when thou wakest if she be by
 beg of her for remedy
 reenter puck
puck captain of our fairy band
 helena is here at hand
 and the youth mistook by me
 pleading for a lover's fee
 shall we their fond pageant see
 lord what fools these mortals be
oberon stand aside the noise they make
 will cause demetrius to awake
puck then will two at once woo one
 that must needs be sport alone
 and those things do best please me
 that befal preposterously
 enter lysander and helena
lysander why should you think that i should woo in scorn
 scorn and derision never come in tears
 look when i vow i weep and vows so born
 in their nativity all truth appears
 how can these things in me seem scorn to you
 bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
helena you do advance your cunning more and more
 when truth kills truth o devilishholy fray
 these vows are hermia's will you give her o'er
 weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
 your vows to her and me put in two scales
 will even weigh and both as light as tales
lysander i had no judgment when to her i swore
helena nor none in my mind now you give her o'er
lysander demetrius loves her and he loves not you
demetrius awaking o helena goddess nymph perfect divine
 to what my love shall i compare thine eyne
 crystal is muddy o how ripe in show
 thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
 that pure congealed white high taurus snow
 fann'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
 when thou hold'st up thy hand o let me kiss
 this princess of pure white this seal of bliss
helena o spite o hell i see you all are bent
 to set against me for your merriment
 if you we re civil and knew courtesy
 you would not do me thus much injury
 can you not hate me as i know you do
 but you must join in souls to mock me too
 if you were men as men you are in show
 you would not use a gentle lady so
 to vow and swear and superpraise my parts
 when i am sure you hate me with your hearts
 you both are rivals and love hermia
 and now both rivals to mock helena
 a trim exploit a manly enterprise
 to conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
 with your derision none of noble sort
 would so offend a virgin and extort
 a poor soul's patience all to make you sport
lysander you are unkind demetrius be not so
 for you love hermia this you know i know
 and here with all good will with all my heart
 in hermia's love i yield you up my part
 and yours of helena to me bequeath
 whom i do love and will do till my death
helena never did mockers waste more idle breath
demetrius lysander keep thy hermia i will none
 if e'er i loved her all that love is gone
 my heart to her but as guestwise sojourn'd
 and now to helen is it home return'd
 there to remain
lysander helen it is not so
demetrius disparage not the faith thou dost not know
 lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
 look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
 reenter hermia
hermia dark night that from the eye his function takes
 the ear more quick of apprehension makes
 wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
 it pays the hearing double recompense
 thou art not by mine eye lysander found
 mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound
 but why unkindly didst thou leave me so
lysander why should he stay whom love doth press to go
hermia what love could press lysander from my side
lysander lysander's love that would not let him bide
 fair helena who more engilds the night
 than all you fiery oes and eyes of light
 why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know
 the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so
hermia you speak not as you think it cannot be
helena lo she is one of this confederacy
 now i perceive they have conjoin'd all three
 to fashion this false sport in spite of me
 injurious hermia most ungrateful maid
 have you conspired have you with these contrived
 to bait me with this foul derision
 is all the counsel that we two have shared
 the sisters vows the hours that we have spent
 when we have chid the hastyfooted time
 for parting uso is it all forgot
 all schooldays friendship childhood innocence
 we hermia like two artificial gods
 have with our needles created both one flower
 both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
 both warbling of one song both in one key
 as if our hands our sides voices and minds
 had been incorporate so we grow together
 like to a double cherry seeming parted
 but yet an union in partition
 two lovely berries moulded on one stem
 so with two seeming bodies but one heart
 two of the first like coats in heraldry
 due but to one and crowned with one crest
 and will you rent our ancient love asunder
 to join with men in scorning your poor friend
 it is not friendly tis not maidenly
 our sex as well as i may chide you for it
 though i alone do feel the injury
hermia i am amazed at your passionate words
 i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
helena have you not set lysander as in scorn
 to follow me and praise my eyes and face
 and made your other love demetrius
 who even but now did spurn me with his foot
 to call me goddess nymph divine and rare
 precious celestial wherefore speaks he this
 to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander
 deny your love so rich within his soul
 and tender me forsooth affection
 but by your setting on by your consent
 what thought i be not so in grace as you
 so hung upon with love so fortunate
 but miserable most to love unloved
 this you should pity rather than despise
hernia i understand not what you mean by this
helena ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
 make mouths upon me when i turn my back
 wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
 this sport well carried shall be chronicled
 if you have any pity grace or manners
 you would not make me such an argument
 but fare ye well tis partly my own fault
 which death or absence soon shall remedy
lysander stay gentle helena hear my excuse
 my love my life my soul fair helena
helena o excellent
hermia sweet do not scorn her so
demetrius if she cannot entreat i can compel
lysander thou canst compel no more than she entreat
 thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
 helen i love thee by my life i do
 i swear by that which i will lose for thee
 to prove him false that says i love thee not
demetrius i say i love thee more than he can do
lysander if thou say so withdraw and prove it too
demetrius quick come
hermia lysander whereto tends all this
lysander away you ethiope
demetrius no no he'll 
 seem to break loose take on as you would follow
 but yet come not you are a tame man go
lysander hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
 or i will shake thee from me like a serpent
hermia why are you grown so rude what change is this
 sweet love
lysander thy love out tawny tartar out
 out loathed medicine hated potion hence
hermia do you not jest
helena yes sooth and so do you
lysander demetrius i will keep my word with thee
demetrius i would i had your bond for i perceive
 a weak bond holds you i'll not trust your word
lysander what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead
 although i hate her i'll not harm her so
hermia what can you do me greater harm than hate
 hate me wherefore o me what news my love
 am not i hermia are not you lysander
 i am as fair now as i was erewhile
 since night you loved me yet since night you left
 me
 why then you left meo the gods forbid
 in earnest shall i say
lysander ay by my life
 and never did desire to see thee more
 therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
 be certain nothing truer tis no jest
 that i do hate thee and love helena
hermia o me you juggler you cankerblossom
 you thief of love what have you come by night
 and stolen my love's heart from him
helena fine i'faith
 have you no modesty no maiden shame
 no touch of bashfulness what will you tear
 impatient answers from my gentle tongue
 fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
hermia puppet why so ay that way goes the game
 now i perceive that she hath made compare
 between our statures she hath urged her height
 and with her personage her tall personage
 her height forsooth she hath prevail'd with him
 and are you grown so high in his esteem
 because i am so dwarfish and so low
 how low am i thou painted maypole speak
 how low am i i am not yet so low
 but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
helena i pray you though you mock me gentlemen
 let her not hurt me i was never curst
 i have no gift at all in shrewishness
 i am a right maid for my cowardice
 let her not strike me you perhaps may think
 because she is something lower than myself
 that i can match her
hermia lower hark again
helena good hermia do not be so bitter with me
 i evermore did love you hermia
 did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you
 save that in love unto demetrius
 i told him of your stealth unto this wood
 he follow'd you for love i follow'd him
 but he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
 to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
 and now so you will let me quiet go
 to athens will i bear my folly back
 and follow you no further let me go
 you see how simple and how fond i am
hermia why get you gone who is't that hinders you
helena a foolish heart that i leave here behind
hermia what with lysander
helena with demetrius
lysander be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena
demetrius no sir she shall not though you take her part
helena o when she's angry she is keen and shrewd
 she was a vixen when she went to school
 and though she be but little she is fierce
hermia little again nothing but low and little'
 why will you suffer her to flout me thus
 let me come to her
lysander get you gone you dwarf
 you minimus of hindering knotgrass made
 you bead you acorn
demetrius you are too officious
 in her behalf that scorns your services
 let her alone speak not of helena
 take not her part for if thou dost intend
 never so little show of love to her
 thou shalt aby it
lysander now she holds me not
 now follow if thou darest to try whose right
 of thine or mine is most in helena
demetrius follow nay i'll go with thee cheek by jole
 exeunt lysander and demetrius
hermia you mistress all this coil is long of you
 nay go not back
helena i will not trust you i
 nor longer stay in your curst company
 your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
 my legs are longer though to run away
 exit
hermia i am amazed and know not what to say
 exit
oberon this is thy negligence still thou mistakest
 or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully
puck believe me king of shadows i mistook
 did not you tell me i should know the man
 by the athenian garment be had on
 and so far blameless proves my enterprise
 that i have nointed an athenian's eyes
 and so far am i glad it so did sort
 as this their jangling i esteem a sport
oberon thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight
 hie therefore robin overcast the night
 the starry welkin cover thou anon
 with drooping fog as black as acheron
 and lead these testy rivals so astray
 as one come not within another's way
 like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue
 then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong
 and sometime rail thou like demetrius
 and from each other look thou lead them thus
 till o'er their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep
 with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
 then crush this herb into lysander's eye
 whose liquor hath this virtuous property
 to take from thence all error with his might
 and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
 when they next wake all this derision
 shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
 and back to athens shall the lovers wend
 with league whose date till death shall never end
 whiles i in this affair do thee employ
 i'll to my queen and beg her indian boy
 and then i will her charmed eye release
 from monster's view and all things shall be peace
puck my fairy lord this must be done with haste
 for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger
 at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
 troop home to churchyards damned spirits all
 that in crossways and floods have burial
 already to their wormy beds are gone
 for fear lest day should look their shames upon
 they willfully themselves exile from light
 and must for aye consort with blackbrow'd night
oberon but we are spirits of another sort
 i with the morning's love have oft made sport
 and like a forester the groves may tread
 even till the eastern gate all fieryred
 opening on neptune with fair blessed beams
 turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
 but notwithstanding haste make no delay
 we may effect this business yet ere day
 exit
puck up and down up and down
 i will lead them up and down
 i am fear'd in field and town
 goblin lead them up and down
 here comes one
 reenter lysander
lysander where art thou proud demetrius speak thou now
puck here villain drawn and ready where art thou

 reenter demetrius

puck thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
 telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars
 and wilt not come come recreant come thou child
 i'll whip thee with a rod he is defiled
 that draws a sword on thee
demetrius yea art thou there
puck follow my voice we'll try no manhood here
 exeunt
 reenter lysander
lysander he goes before me and still dares me on
 when i come where he calls then he is gone
 the villain is much lighterheel'd than i

 and here will rest me
 lies down

 for if but once thou show me thy grey light
 i'll find demetrius and revenge this spite

 thou runn'st before me shifting every place
 and darest not stand nor look me in the face
 where art thou now
puck come hither i am here
demetrius nay then thou mock'st me thou shalt buy this dear
 if ever i thy face by daylight see
 now go thy way faintness constraineth me
 to measure out my length on this cold bed
 by day's approach look to be visited
 lies down and sleeps
 reenter helena
helena o weary night o long and tedious night
 abate thy hour shine comforts from the east
 that i may back to athens by daylight
 from these that my poor company detest
 and sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye
 steal me awhile from mine own company
 lies down and sleeps

 two of both kinds make up four
 here she comes curst and sad
 cupid is a knavish lad
 thus to make poor females mad
 reenter hermia
hermia never so weary never so in woe
 bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
 i can no further crawl no further go
 my legs can keep no pace with my desires
 here will i rest me till the break of day

 lies down and sleeps
puck on the ground
 sleep sound
 i'll apply
 to your eye
 gentle lover remedy
 squeezing the juice on lysander's eyes
 when thou wakest
 thou takest
 true delight

 and the country proverb known
 that every man should take his own
 in your waking shall be shown
 jack shall have jill

 enter puck
oberon advancing welcome good robin
 see'st thou this sweet sight
 her dotage now i do begin to pity
 for meeting her of late behind the wood
 seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool
 i did upbraid her and fall out with her
 for she his hairy temples then had rounded
 with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
 and that same dew which sometime on the buds
 was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
 stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes
 like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
 when i had at my pleasure taunted her
 and she in mild terms begg'd my patience
 i then did ask of her her changeling child
 which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
 to bear him to my bower in fairy land
 and now i have the boy i will undo
 this hateful imperfection of her eyes
 and gentle puck take this transformed scalp
 from off the head of this athenian swain
 that he awaking when the other do
 may all to athens back again repair
 and think no more of this night's accidents
 but as the fierce vexation of a dream
 but first i will release the fairy queen
 be as thou wast wont to be
 see as thou wast wont to see
 dian's bud o'er cupid's flower
 hath such force and blessed power
 now my titania wake you my sweet queen
titania my oberon what visions have i seen
 methought i was enamour'd of an ass
oberon there lies your love
titania how came these things to pass
 o how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
oberon silence awhile robin take off this head
 titania music call and strike more dead
 than common sleep of all these five the sense
titania music ho music such as charmeth sleep
 music still
puck now when thou wakest with thine
 own fool's eyes peep
oberon sound music come my queen take hands with me
 and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
 now thou and i are new in amity
 and will tomorrow midnight solemnly
 dance in duke theseus house triumphantly
 and bless it to all fair prosperity
 there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
 wedded with theseus all in jollity
puck fairy king attend and mark
 i do hear the morning lark
oberon then my queen in silence sad
 trip we after the night's shade
 we the globe can compass soon
 swifter than the wandering moon
titania come my lord and in our flight
 tell me how it came this night
 that i sleeping here was found
 with these mortals on the ground
 exeunt
 horns winded within
 enter theseus hippolyta egeus and train
theseus go one of you find out the forester
 for now our observation is perform'd
 and since we have the vaward of the day
 my love shall hear the music of my hounds
 uncouple in the western valley let them go
 dispatch i say and find the forester
 exit an attendant
 we will fair queen up to the mountain's top
 and mark the musical confusion
 of hounds and echo in conjunction
hippolyta i was with hercules and cadmus once
 when in a wood of crete they bay'd the bear
 with hounds of sparta never did i hear
 such gallant chiding for besides the groves
 the skies the fountains every region near
 seem'd all one mutual cry i never heard
 so musical a discord such sweet thunder
theseus my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind
 so flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung
 with ears that sweep away the morning dew
 crookknee'd and dewlapp'd like thessalian bulls
 slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells
 each under each a cry more tuneable
 was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn
 in crete in sparta nor in thessaly
 judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these
egeus my lord this is my daughter here asleep
 and this lysander this demetrius is
 this helena old nedar's helena
 i wonder of their being here together
theseus no doubt they rose up early to observe
 the rite of may and hearing our intent
 came here in grace our solemnity
 but speak egeus is not this the day
 that hermia should give answer of her choice
egeus it is my lord
theseus go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
 horns and shout within lysander demetrius
 helena and hermia wake and start up
 good morrow friends saint valentine is past
 begin these woodbirds but to couple now
lysander pardon my lord
theseus i pray you all stand up
 i know you two are rival enemies
 how comes this gentle concord in the world
 that hatred is so far from jealousy
 to sleep by hate and fear no enmity
lysander my lord i shall reply amazedly
 half sleep half waking but as yet i swear
 i cannot truly say how i came here
 but as i thinkfor truly would i speak
 and now do i bethink me so it is
 i came with hermia hither our intent
 was to be gone from athens where we might
 without the peril of the athenian law
egeus enough enough my lord you have enough
 i beg the law the law upon his head
 they would have stolen away they would demetrius
 thereby to have defeated you and me
 you of your wife and me of my consent
 of my consent that she should be your wife
demetrius my lord fair helen told me of their stealth
 of this their purpose hither to this wood
 and i in fury hither follow'd them
 fair helena in fancy following me
 but my good lord i wot not by what power
 but by some power it ismy love to hermia
 melted as the snow seems to me now
 as the remembrance of an idle gaud
 which in my childhood i did dote upon
 and all the faith the virtue of my heart
 the object and the pleasure of mine eye
 is only helena to her my lord
 was i betroth'd ere i saw hermia
 but like in sickness did i loathe this food
 but as in health come to my natural taste
 now i do wish it love it long for it
 and will for evermore be true to it
theseus fair lovers you are fortunately met
 of this discourse we more will hear anon
 egeus i will overbear your will
 for in the temple by and by with us
 these couples shall eternally be knit
 and for the morning now is something worn
 our purposed hunting shall be set aside
 away with us to athens three and three
 we'll hold a feast in great solemnity
 come hippolyta
 exeunt theseus hippolyta egeus and train
demetrius these things seem small and undistinguishable
hermia methinks i see these things with parted eye
 when every thing seems double
helena so methinks
 and i have found demetrius like a jewel
 mine own and not mine own
demetrius are you sure
 that we are awake it seems to me
 that yet we sleep we dream do not you think
 the duke was here and bid us follow him
hermia yea and my father
helena and hippolyta
lysander and he did bid us follow to the temple
demetrius why then we are awake let's follow him
 and by the way let us recount our dreams
 exeunt
bottom awaking when my cue comes call me and i will
 answer my next is most fair pyramus heighho
 peter quince flute the bellowsmender snout
 the tinker starveling god's my life stolen
 hence and left me asleep i have had a most rare
 vision i have had a dream past the wit of man to
 say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go
 about to expound this dream methought i wasthere
 is no man can tell what methought i wasand
 methought i hadbut man is but a patched fool if
 he will offer to say what methought i had the eye
 of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not
 seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue
 to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream
 was i will get peter quince to write a ballad of
 this dream it shall be called bottom's dream
 because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the
 latter end of a play before the duke
 peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall
 sing it at her death
 exit
 a midsummer night's dream
act iv
scene ii athens quince's house
 enter quince flute snout and starveling
quince have you sent to bottom's house is he come home yet
starveling he cannot be heard of out of doubt he is
 transported
flute if he come not then the play is marred it goes
 not forward doth it
quince it is not possible you have not a man in all
 athens able to discharge pyramus but he
flute no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
 man in athens
quince yea and the best person too and he is a very
 paramour for a sweet voice
flute you must say paragon a paramour is god bless us
 a thing of naught
 enter snug
snug masters the duke is coming from the temple and
 there is two or three lords and ladies more married
 if our sport had gone forward we had all been made
 men
flute o sweet bully bottom thus hath he lost sixpence a
 day during his life he could not have scaped
 sixpence a day an the duke had not given him
 sixpence a day for playing pyramus i'll be hanged
 he would have deserved it sixpence a day in
 pyramus or nothing
 enter bottom
bottom where are these lads where are these hearts
quince bottom o most courageous day o most happy hour
bottom masters i am to discourse wonders but ask me not
 what for if i tell you i am no true athenian i
 will tell you every thing right as it fell out

 pumps meet presently at the palace every man look
 o'er his part for the short and the long is our
 play is preferred in any case let thisby have
 clean linen and let not him that plays the lion
 pair his nails for they shall hang out for the
 lion's claws and most dear actors eat no onions
 nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and i
 do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet
 comedy no more words away go away
 exeunt
 a midsummer night's dream
act v
scene i athens the palace of theseus
 enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and
 attendants
hippolyta tis strange my theseus that these
 lovers speak of
theseus more strange than true i never may believe
 these antique fables nor these fairy toys
 lovers and madmen have such seething brains
 such shaping fantasies that apprehend
 more than cool reason ever comprehends
 the lunatic the lover and the poet
 are of imagination all compact
 one sees more devils than vast hell can hold
 that is the madman the lover all as frantic
 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt
 the poet's eye in fine frenzy rolling
 doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
 and as imagination bodies forth
 the forms of things unknown the poet's pen
 turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
 a local habitation and a name
 such tricks hath strong imagination
 that if it would but apprehend some joy
 it comprehends some bringer of that joy
 or in the night imagining some fear
 how easy is a bush supposed a bear
hippolyta but all the story of the night told over
 and all their minds transfigured so together
 more witnesseth than fancy's images
 and grows to something of great constancy
 but howsoever strange and admirable
theseus here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
 enter lysander demetrius hermia and helena
 joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
 accompany your hearts
lysander more than to us
 wait in your royal walks your board your bed
theseus come now what masques what dances shall we have
 to wear away this long age of three hours
 between our aftersupper and bedtime
 where is our usual manager of mirth
 what revels are in hand is there no play
 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour
 call philostrate
philostrate here mighty theseus
theseus say what abridgement have you for this evening
 what masque what music how shall we beguile
 the lazy time if not with some delight
philostrate there is a brief how many sports are ripe
 make choice of which your highness will see first
 giving a paper
theseus reads the battle with the centaurs to be sung
 by an athenian eunuch to the harp'
 we'll none of that that have i told my love
 in glory of my kinsman hercules
 reads
 the riot of the tipsy bacchanals
 tearing the thracian singer in their rage'
 that is an old device and it was play'd
 when i from thebes came last a conqueror
 reads
 the thrice three muses mourning for the death
 of learning late deceased in beggary'
 that is some satire keen and critical
 not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
 reads
 a tedious brief scene of young pyramus
 and his love thisbe very tragical mirth'
 merry and tragical tedious and brief
 that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
 how shall we find the concord of this discord
philostrate a play there is my lord some ten words long
 which is as brief as i have known a play
 but by ten words my lord it is too long
 which makes it tedious for in all the play
 there is not one word apt one player fitted
 and tragical my noble lord it is
 for pyramus therein doth kill himself
 which when i saw rehearsed i must confess
 made mine eyes water but more merry tears
 the passion of loud laughter never shed
theseus what are they that do play it
philostrate hardhanded men that work in athens here
 which never labour'd in their minds till now
 and now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
 with this same play against your nuptial
theseus and we will hear it
philostrate no my noble lord
 it is not for you i have heard it over
 and it is nothing nothing in the world
 unless you can find sport in their intents
 extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain
 to do you service
theseus i will hear that play
 for never anything can be amiss
 when simpleness and duty tender it
 go bring them in and take your places ladies
 exit philostrate
hippolyta i love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
 and duty in his service perishing
theseus why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
hippolyta he says they can do nothing in this kind
theseus the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
 our sport shall be to take what they mistake
 and what poor duty cannot do noble respect
 takes it in might not merit
 where i have come great clerks have purposed
 to greet me with premeditated welcomes
 where i have seen them shiver and look pale
 make periods in the midst of sentences
 throttle their practised accent in their fears
 and in conclusion dumbly have broke off
 not paying me a welcome trust me sweet
 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome
 and in the modesty of fearful duty
 i read as much as from the rattling tongue
 of saucy and audacious eloquence
 love therefore and tonguetied simplicity
 in least speak most to my capacity
 reenter philostrate
philostrate so please your grace the prologue is address'd
theseus let him approach
 flourish of trumpets
 enter quince for the prologue
prologue if we offend it is with our good will
 that you should think we come not to offend
 but with good will to show our simple skill
 that is the true beginning of our end
 consider then we come but in despite
 we do not come as minding to contest you
 our true intent is all for your delight
 we are not here that you should here repent you
 the actors are at hand and by their show
 you shall know all that you are like to know
theseus this fellow doth not stand upon points
lysander he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows
 not the stop a good moral my lord it is not
 enough to speak but to speak true
hippolyta indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
 on a recorder a sound but not in government
theseus his speech was like a tangled chain nothing
 impaired but all disordered who is next
 enter pyramus and thisbe wall moonshine and lion
prologue gentles perchance you wonder at this show
 but wonder on till truth make all things plain
 this man is pyramus if you would know
 this beauteous lady thisby is certain
 this man with lime and roughcast doth present
 wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder
 and through wall's chink poor souls they are content
 to whisper at the which let no man wonder
 this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
 presenteth moonshine for if you will know
 by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
 to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo
 this grisly beast which lion hight by name
 the trusty thisby coming first by night
 did scare away or rather did affright
 and as she fled her mantle she did fall
 which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
 anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall
 and finds his trusty thisby's mantle slain
 whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
 he bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast
 and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
 his dagger drew and died for all the rest
 let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain
 at large discourse while here they do remain
 exeunt prologue thisbe lion and moonshine
theseus i wonder if the lion be to speak
demetrius no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
wall in this same interlude it doth befall
 that i one snout by name present a wall
 and such a wall as i would have you think
 that had in it a crannied hole or chink
 through which the lovers pyramus and thisby
 did whisper often very secretly
 this loam this roughcast and this stone doth show
 that i am that same wall the truth is so
 and this the cranny is right and sinister
 through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
theseus would you desire lime and hair to speak better
demetrius it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard
 discourse my lord
 enter pyramus
theseus pyramus draws near the wall silence
pyramus o grimlook'd night o night with hue so black
 o night which ever art when day is not
 o night o night alack alack alack
 i fear my thisby's promise is forgot
 and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall
 that stand'st between her father's ground and mine
 thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall
 show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
 wall holds up his fingers
 thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this
 but what see i no thisby do i see
 o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss
 cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
theseus the wall methinks being sensible should curse again
pyramus no in truth sir he should not deceiving me'
 is thisby's cue she is to enter now and i am to
 spy her through the wall you shall see it will
 fall pat as i told you yonder she comes
 enter thisbe
thisbe o wall full often hast thou heard my moans
 for parting my fair pyramus and me
 my cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones
 thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
pyramus i see a voice now will i to the chink
 to spy an i can hear my thisby's face thisby
thisbe my love thou art my love i think
pyramus think what thou wilt i am thy lover's grace
 and like limander am i trusty still
thisbe and i like helen till the fates me kill
pyramus not shafalus to procrus was so true
thisbe as shafalus to procrus i to you
pyramus o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
thisbe i kiss the wall's hole not your lips at all
pyramus wilt thou at ninny's tomb meet me straightway
thisbe tide life tide death i come without delay
 exeunt pyramus and thisbe
wall thus have i wall my part discharged so
 and being done thus wall away doth go
 exit
theseus now is the mural down between the two neighbours
demetrius no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear
 without warning
hippolyta this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard
theseus the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst
 are no worse if imagination amend them
hippolyta it must be your imagination then and not theirs
theseus if we imagine no worse of them than they of
 themselves they may pass for excellent men here
 come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
 enter lion and moonshine
lion you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
 the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
 may now perchance both quake and tremble here
 when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
 then know that i one snug the joiner am
 a lionfell nor else no lion's dam
 for if i should as lion come in strife
 into this place twere pity on my life
theseus a very gentle beast of a good conscience
demetrius the very best at a beast my lord that e'er i saw
lysander this lion is a very fox for his valour
theseus true and a goose for his discretion
demetrius not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his
 discretion and the fox carries the goose
theseus his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour
 for the goose carries not the fox it is well
 leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon
moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
demetrius he should have worn the horns on his head
theseus he is no crescent and his horns are
 invisible within the circumference
moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
 myself the man i the moon do seem to be
theseus this is the greatest error of all the rest the man
 should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the
 man i the moon
demetrius he dares not come there for the candle for you
 see it is already in snuff
hippolyta i am aweary of this moon would he would change
theseus it appears by his small light of discretion that
 he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all
 reason we must stay the time
lysander proceed moon
moonshine all that i have to say is to tell you that the
 lanthorn is the moon i the man in the moon this
 thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog
demetrius why all these should be in the lanthorn for all
 these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe
 enter thisbe
thisbe this is old ninny's tomb where is my love
lion roaring oh
 thisbe runs off
demetrius well roared lion
theseus well run thisbe
hippolyta well shone moon truly the moon shines with a
 good grace
 the lion shakes thisbe's mantle and exit
theseus well moused lion
lysander and so the lion vanished
demetrius and then came pyramus
 enter pyramus
pyramus sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams
 i thank thee moon for shining now so bright
 for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
 i trust to take of truest thisby sight
 but stay o spite
 but mark poor knight
 what dreadful dole is here
 eyes do you see
 how can it be
 o dainty duck o dear
 thy mantle good
 what stain'd with blood
 approach ye furies fell
 o fates come come
 cut thread and thrum
 quail crush conclude and quell
theseus this passion and the death of a dear friend would
 go near to make a man look sad
hippolyta beshrew my heart but i pity the man
pyramus o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame
 since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear
 which isno nowhich was the fairest dame
 that lived that loved that liked that look'd
 with cheer
 come tears confound
 out sword and wound
 the pap of pyramus
 ay that left pap
 where heart doth hop
 stabs himself
 thus die i thus thus thus
 now am i dead
 now am i fled
 my soul is in the sky
 tongue lose thy light
 moon take thy flight
 exit moonshine
 now die die die die die
 dies
demetrius no die but an ace for him for he is but one
lysander less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
theseus with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and
 prove an ass
hippolyta how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes
 back and finds her lover
theseus she will find him by starlight here she comes and
 her passion ends the play
 reenter thisbe
hippolyta methinks she should not use a long one for such a
 pyramus i hope she will be brief
demetrius a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which
 thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us
 she for a woman god bless us
lysander she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
demetrius and thus she means videlicet
thisbe asleep my love
 what dead my dove
 o pyramus arise
 speak speak quite dumb
 dead dead a tomb
 must cover thy sweet eyes
 these my lips
 this cherry nose
 these yellow cowslip cheeks
 are gone are gone
 lovers make moan
 his eyes were green as leeks
 o sisters three
 come come to me
 with hands as pale as milk
 lay them in gore
 since you have shore
 with shears his thread of silk
 tongue not a word
 come trusty sword
 come blade my breast imbrue
 stabs herself
 and farewell friends
 thus thisby ends
 adieu adieu adieu
 dies
theseus moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead
demetrius ay and wall too
bottom starting up no assure you the wall is down that
 parted their fathers will it please you to see the
 epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two
 of our company
theseus no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no
 excuse never excuse for when the players are all
 dead there needs none to be blamed marry if he
 that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself
 in thisbe's garter it would have been a fine
 tragedy and so it is truly and very notably
 discharged but come your bergomask let your
 epilogue alone
 a dance
 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
 lovers to bed tis almost fairy time
 i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
 as much as we this night have overwatch'd
 this palpablegross play hath well beguiled
 the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed
 a fortnight hold we this solemnity
 in nightly revels and new jollity
 exeunt
 enter puck
puck now the hungry lion roars
 and the wolf behowls the moon
 whilst the heavy ploughman snores
 all with weary task fordone
 now the wasted brands do glow
 whilst the screechowl screeching loud
 puts the wretch that lies in woe
 in remembrance of a shroud
 now it is the time of night
 that the graves all gaping wide
 every one lets forth his sprite
 in the churchway paths to glide
 and we fairies that do run
 by the triple hecate's team
 from the presence of the sun
 following darkness like a dream
 now are frolic not a mouse
 shall disturb this hallow'd house
 i am sent with broom before
 to sweep the dust behind the door
 enter oberon and titania with their train
oberon through the house give gathering light
 by the dead and drowsy fire
 every elf and fairy sprite
 hop as light as bird from brier
 and this ditty after me
 sing and dance it trippingly
titania first rehearse your song by rote
 to each word a warbling note
 hand in hand with fairy grace
 will we sing and bless this place
 song and dance
oberon now until the break of day
 through this house each fairy stray
 to the best bridebed will we
 which by us shall blessed be
 and the issue there create
 ever shall be fortunate
 so shall all the couples three
 ever true in loving be
 and the blots of nature's hand
 shall not in their issue stand
 never mole hare lip nor scar
 nor mark prodigious such as are
 despised in nativity
 shall upon their children be
 with this fielddew consecrate
 every fairy take his gait
 and each several chamber bless
 through this palace with sweet peace
 and the owner of it blest
 ever shall in safety rest
 trip away make no stay
 meet me all by break of day
 exeunt oberon titania and train
puck if we shadows have offended
 think but this and all is mended
 that you have but slumber'd here
 while these visions did appear
 and this weak and idle theme
 no more yielding but a dream
 gentles do not reprehend
 if you pardon we will mend
 and as i am an honest puck
 if we have unearned luck
 now to scape the serpent's tongue
 we will make amends ere long
 else the puck a liar call
 so good night unto you all
 give me your hands if we be friends
 and robin shall restore amends

 much ado about nothing
act i
scene i before leonato's house
 enter leonato hero and beatrice with a
 messenger
leonato i learn in this letter that don peter of arragon
 comes this night to messina
messenger he is very near by this he was not three leagues off
 when i left him
leonato how many gentlemen have you lost in this action
messenger but few of any sort and none of name
leonato a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
 home full numbers i find here that don peter hath
 bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio
messenger much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
 don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the
 promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb
 the feats of a lion he hath indeed better
 bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
 tell you how
leonato he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much
 glad of it
messenger i have already delivered him letters and there
 appears much joy in him even so much that joy could
 not show itself modest enough without a badge of
 bitterness
leonato did he break out into tears
messenger in great measure
leonato a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces
 truer than those that are so washed how much
 better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping
beatrice i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the
 wars or no
messenger i know none of that name lady there was none such
 in the army of any sort
leonato what is he that you ask for niece
hero my cousin means signior benedick of padua
messenger o he's returned and as pleasant as ever he was
beatrice he set up his bills here in messina and challenged
 cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool reading
 the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged
 him at the birdbolt i pray you how many hath he
 killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath
 he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing
leonato faith niece you tax signior benedick too much
 but he'll be meet with you i doubt it not
messenger he hath done good service lady in these wars
beatrice you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it
 he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an
 excellent stomach
messenger and a good soldier too lady
beatrice and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord
messenger a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all
 honourable virtues
beatrice it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man
 but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal
leonato you must not sir mistake my niece there is a
 kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her
 they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
 between them
beatrice alas he gets nothing by that in our last
 conflict four of his five wits went halting off and
 now is the whole man governed with one so that if
 he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him
 bear it for a difference between himself and his
 horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left
 to be known a reasonable creature who is his
 companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother
messenger is't possible
beatrice very easily possible he wears his faith but as
 the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the
 next block
messenger i see lady the gentleman is not in your books
beatrice no an he were i would burn my study but i pray
 you who is his companion is there no young
 squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil
messenger he is most in the company of the right noble claudio
beatrice o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he
 is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker
 runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if
 he have caught the benedick it will cost him a
 thousand pound ere a be cured
messenger i will hold friends with you lady
beatrice do good friend
leonato you will never run mad niece
beatrice no not till a hot january
messenger don pedro is approached
 enter don pedro don john claudio benedick
 and balthasar
don pedro good signior leonato you are come to meet your
 trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid
 cost and you encounter it
leonato never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
 your grace for trouble being gone comfort should
 remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides
 and happiness takes his leave
don pedro you embrace your charge too willingly i think this
 is your daughter
leonato her mother hath many times told me so
benedick were you in doubt sir that you asked her
leonato signior benedick no for then were you a child
don pedro you have it full benedick we may guess by this
 what you are being a man truly the lady fathers
 herself be happy lady for you are like an
 honourable father
benedick if signior leonato be her father she would not
 have his head on her shoulders for all messina as
 like him as she is
beatrice i wonder that you will still be talking signior
 benedick nobody marks you
benedick what my dear lady disdain are you yet living
beatrice is it possible disdain should die while she hath
 such meet food to feed it as signior benedick
 courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come
 in her presence
benedick then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i
 am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i
 would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard
 heart for truly i love none
beatrice a dear happiness to women they would else have
 been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god
 and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i
 had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
 swear he loves me
benedick god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some
 gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
 scratched face
beatrice scratching could not make it worse an twere such
 a face as yours were
benedick well you are a rare parrotteacher
beatrice a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours
benedick i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and
 so good a continuer but keep your way i god's
 name i have done
beatrice you always end with a jade's trick i know you of old
don pedro that is the sum of all leonato signior claudio
 and signior benedick my dear friend leonato hath
 invited you all i tell him we shall stay here at
 the least a month and he heartily prays some
 occasion may detain us longer i dare swear he is no
 hypocrite but prays from his heart
leonato if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn
 to don john
 let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to
 the prince your brother i owe you all duty
don john i thank you i am not of many words but i thank
 you
leonato please it your grace lead on
don pedro your hand leonato we will go together
 exeunt all except benedick and claudio
claudio benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato
benedick i noted her not but i looked on her
claudio is she not a modest young lady
benedick do you question me as an honest man should do for
 my simple true judgment or would you have me speak
 after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex
claudio no i pray thee speak in sober judgment
benedick why i faith methinks she's too low for a high
 praise too brown for a fair praise and too little
 for a great praise only this commendation i can
 afford her that were she other than she is she
 were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i
 do not like her
claudio thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me
 truly how thou likest her
benedick would you buy her that you inquire after her
claudio can the world buy such a jewel
benedick yea and a case to put it into but speak you this
 with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack
 to tell us cupid is a good harefinder and vulcan a
 rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take
 you to go in the song
claudio in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i
 looked on
benedick i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such
 matter there's her cousin an she were not
 possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty
 as the first of may doth the last of december but i
 hope you have no intent to turn husband have you
claudio i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the
 contrary if hero would be my wife
benedick is't come to this in faith hath not the world
 one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion
 shall i never see a bachelor of threescore again
 go to i faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
 into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away
 sundays look don pedro is returned to seek you
 reenter don pedro
don pedro what secret hath held you here that you followed
 not to leonato's
benedick i would your grace would constrain me to tell
don pedro i charge thee on thy allegiance
benedick you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb
 man i would have you think so but on my
 allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is
 in love with who now that is your grace's part
 mark how short his answer iswith hero leonato's
 short daughter
claudio if this were so so were it uttered
benedick like the old tale my lord it is not so nor
 twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be
 so'
claudio if my passion change not shortly god forbid it
 should be otherwise
don pedro amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy
claudio you speak this to fetch me in my lord
don pedro by my troth i speak my thought
claudio and in faith my lord i spoke mine
benedick and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine
claudio that i love her i feel
don pedro that she is worthy i know
benedick that i neither feel how she should be loved nor
 know how she should be worthy is the opinion that
 fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake
don pedro thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
 of beauty
claudio and never could maintain his part but in the force
 of his will
benedick that a woman conceived me i thank her that she
 brought me up i likewise give her most humble
 thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my
 forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick
 all women shall pardon me because i will not do
 them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the
 right to trust none and the fine is for the which
 i may go the finer i will live a bachelor
don pedro i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love
benedick with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord
 not with love prove that ever i lose more blood
 with love than i will get again with drinking pick
 out mine eyes with a balladmaker's pen and hang me
 up at the door of a brothelhouse for the sign of
 blind cupid
don pedro well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou
 wilt prove a notable argument
benedick if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
 at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on
 the shoulder and called adam
don pedro well as time shall try in time the savage bull
 doth bear the yoke'
benedick the savage bull may but if ever the sensible
 benedick bear it pluck off the bull's horns and set
 them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted
 and in such great letters as they write here is
 good horse to hire let them signify under my sign
 here you may see benedick the married man'
claudio if this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad
don pedro nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in
 venice thou wilt quake for this shortly
benedick i look for an earthquake too then
don pedro well you temporize with the hours in the
 meantime good signior benedick repair to
 leonato's commend me to him and tell him i will
 not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made
 great preparation
benedick i have almost matter enough in me for such an
 embassage and so i commit you
claudio to the tuition of god from my house if i had it
don pedro the sixth of july your loving friend benedick
benedick nay mock not mock not the body of your
 discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and
 the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere
 you flout old ends any further examine your
 conscience and so i leave you
 exit
claudio my liege your highness now may do me good
don pedro my love is thine to teach teach it but how
 and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
 any hard lesson that may do thee good
claudio hath leonato any son my lord
don pedro no child but hero she's his only heir
 dost thou affect her claudio
claudio o my lord
 when you went onward on this ended action
 i look'd upon her with a soldier's eye
 that liked but had a rougher task in hand
 than to drive liking to the name of love
 but now i am return'd and that warthoughts
 have left their places vacant in their rooms
 come thronging soft and delicate desires
 all prompting me how fair young hero is
 saying i liked her ere i went to wars
don pedro thou wilt be like a lover presently
 and tire the hearer with a book of words
 if thou dost love fair hero cherish it
 and i will break with her and with her father
 and thou shalt have her was't not to this end
 that thou began'st to twist so fine a story
claudio how sweetly you do minister to love
 that know love's grief by his complexion
 but lest my liking might too sudden seem
 i would have salved it with a longer treatise
don pedro what need the bridge much broader than the flood
 the fairest grant is the necessity
 look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovest
 and i will fit thee with the remedy
 i know we shall have revelling tonight
 i will assume thy part in some disguise
 and tell fair hero i am claudio
 and in her bosom i'll unclasp my heart
 and take her hearing prisoner with the force
 and strong encounter of my amorous tale
 then after to her father will i break
 and the conclusion is she shall be thine
 in practise let us put it presently

scene ii a room in leonato's house
 enter leonato and antonio meeting
leonato how now brother where is my cousin your son
 hath he provided this music
antonio he is very busy about it but brother i can tell
 you strange news that you yet dreamt not of
leonato are they good
antonio as the event stamps them but they have a good
 cover they show well outward the prince and count
 claudio walking in a thickpleached alley in mine
 orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine
 the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my
 niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
 this night in a dance and if he found her
 accordant he meant to take the present time by the
 top and instantly break with you of it
leonato hath the fellow any wit that told you this
antonio a good sharp fellow i will send for him and
 question him yourself
leonato no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear
 itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal
 that she may be the better prepared for an answer
 if peradventure this be true go you and tell her of it

scene iii the same
 enter don john and conrade
conrade what the goodyear my lord why are you thus out
 of measure sad
don john there is no measure in the occasion that breeds
 therefore the sadness is without limit
conrade you should hear reason
don john and when i have heard it what blessing brings it
conrade if not a present remedy at least a patient
 sufferance
don john i wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art
 born under saturn goest about to apply a moral
 medicine to a mortifying mischief i cannot hide
 what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile
 at no man's jests eat when i have stomach and wait
 for no man's leisure sleep when i am drowsy and
 tend on no man's business laugh when i am merry and
 claw no man in his humour
conrade yea but you must not make the full show of this
 till you may do it without controlment you have of
 late stood out against your brother and he hath
 ta'en you newly into his grace where it is
 impossible you should take true root but by the
 fair weather that you make yourself it is needful
 that you frame the season for your own harvest
don john i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
 his grace and it better fits my blood to be
 disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
 love from any in this though i cannot be said to
 be a flattering honest man it must not be denied
 but i am a plaindealing villain i am trusted with
 a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i
 have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my
 mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do
 my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and
 seek not to alter me
conrade can you make no use of your discontent
don john i make all use of it for i use it only
 who comes here
 enter borachio
 what news borachio
borachio i came yonder from a great supper the prince your
 brother is royally entertained by leonato and i
 can give you intelligence of an intended marriage
don john will it serve for any model to build mischief on
 what is he for a fool that betroths himself to
 unquietness
borachio marry it is your brother's right hand
don john who the most exquisite claudio
borachio even he
don john a proper squire and who and who which way looks
 he
borachio marry on hero the daughter and heir of leonato
don john a very forward marchchick how came you to this
borachio being entertained for a perfumer as i was smoking a
 musty room comes me the prince and claudio hand
 in hand in sad conference i whipt me behind the
 arras and there heard it agreed upon that the
 prince should woo hero for himself and having
 obtained her give her to count claudio
don john come come let us thither this may prove food to
 my displeasure that young startup hath all the
 glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i
 bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist me
conrade to the death my lord
don john let us to the great supper their cheer is the
 greater that i am subdued would the cook were of
 my mind shall we go prove what's to be done
borachio we'll wait upon your lordship
 exeunt
 much ado about nothing
act ii
scene i a hall in leonato's house
 enter leonato antonio hero beatrice and others
leonato was not count john here at supper
antonio i saw him not
beatrice how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see
 him but i am heartburned an hour after
hero he is of a very melancholy disposition
beatrice he were an excellent man that were made just in the
 midway between him and benedick the one is too
 like an image and says nothing and the other too
 like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling
leonato then half signior benedick's tongue in count john's
 mouth and half count john's melancholy in signior
 benedick's face
beatrice with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money
 enough in his purse such a man would win any woman
 in the world if a could get her goodwill
leonato by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a
 husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
antonio in faith she's too curst
beatrice too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god's
 sending that way for it is said god sends a curst
 cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none
leonato so by being too curst god will send you no horns
beatrice just if he send me no husband for the which
 blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and
 evening lord i could not endure a husband with a
 beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen
leonato you may light on a husband that hath no beard
beatrice what should i do with him dress him in my apparel
 and make him my waitinggentlewoman he that hath a
 beard is more than a youth and he that hath no
 beard is less than a man and he that is more than
 a youth is not for me and he that is less than a
 man i am not for him therefore i will even take
 sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his
 apes into hell
leonato well then go you into hell
beatrice no but to the gate and there will the devil meet
 me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and
 say get you to heaven beatrice get you to
 heaven here's no place for you maids so deliver
 i up my apes and away to saint peter for the
 heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and
 there live we as merry as the day is long
antonio to hero well niece i trust you will be ruled
 by your father
beatrice yes faith it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
 and say father as it please you but yet for all
 that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else
 make another curtsy and say father as it please
 me'
leonato well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband
beatrice not till god make men of some other metal than
 earth would it not grieve a woman to be
 overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make
 an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
 no uncle i'll none adam's sons are my brethren
 and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred
leonato daughter remember what i told you if the prince
 do solicit you in that kind you know your answer
beatrice the fault will be in the music cousin if you be
 not wooed in good time if the prince be too
 important tell him there is measure in every thing
 and so dance out the answer for hear me hero
 wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig
 a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot
 and hasty like a scotch jig and full as
 fantastical the wedding mannerlymodest as a
 measure full of state and ancientry and then comes
 repentance and with his bad legs falls into the
 cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave
leonato cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly
beatrice i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight
leonato the revellers are entering brother make good room
 all put on their masks
 enter don pedro claudio benedick balthasar
 don john borachio margaret ursula and others masked
don pedro lady will you walk about with your friend
hero so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing
 i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away
don pedro with me in your company
hero i may say so when i please
don pedro and when please you to say so
hero when i like your favour for god defend the lute
 should be like the case
don pedro my visor is philemon's roof within the house is jove
hero why then your visor should be thatched
don pedro speak low if you speak love
 drawing her aside
balthasar well i would you did like me
margaret so would not i for your own sake for i have many
 illqualities
balthasar which is one
margaret i say my prayers aloud
balthasar i love you the better the hearers may cry amen
margaret god match me with a good dancer
balthasar amen
margaret and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is
 done answer clerk
balthasar no more words the clerk is answered
ursula i know you well enough you are signior antonio
antonio at a word i am not
ursula i know you by the waggling of your head
antonio to tell you true i counterfeit him
ursula you could never do him so illwell unless you were
 the very man here's his dry hand up and down you
 are he you are he
antonio at a word i am not
ursula come come do you think i do not know you by your
 excellent wit can virtue hide itself go to
 mum you are he graces will appear and there's an
 end
beatrice will you not tell me who told you so
benedick no you shall pardon me
beatrice nor will you not tell me who you are
benedick not now
beatrice that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit
 out of the hundred merry tales'well this was
 signior benedick that said so
benedick what's he
beatrice i am sure you know him well enough
benedick not i believe me
beatrice did he never make you laugh
benedick i pray you what is he
beatrice why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool
 only his gift is in devising impossible slanders
 none but libertines delight in him and the
 commendation is not in his wit but in his villany
 for he both pleases men and angers them and then
 they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in
 the fleet i would he had boarded me
benedick when i know the gentleman i'll tell him what you say
beatrice do do he'll but break a comparison or two on me
 which peradventure not marked or not laughed at
 strikes him into melancholy and then there's a
 partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no
 supper that night
 music
 we must follow the leaders
benedick in every good thing
beatrice nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at
 the next turning
 dance then exeunt all except don john borachio
 and claudio
don john sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath
 withdrawn her father to break with him about it
 the ladies follow her and but one visor remains
borachio and that is claudio i know him by his bearing
don john are not you signior benedick
claudio you know me well i am he
don john signior you are very near my brother in his love
 he is enamoured on hero i pray you dissuade him
 from her she is no equal for his birth you may
 do the part of an honest man in it
claudio how know you he loves her
don john i heard him swear his affection
borachio so did i too and he swore he would marry her tonight
don john come let us to the banquet
 exeunt don john and borachio
claudio thus answer i in the name of benedick
 but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio
 tis certain so the prince wooes for himself
 friendship is constant in all other things
 save in the office and affairs of love
 therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
 let every eye negotiate for itself
 and trust no agent for beauty is a witch
 against whose charms faith melteth into blood
 this is an accident of hourly proof
 which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero
 reenter benedick
benedick count claudio
claudio yea the same
benedick come will you go with me
claudio whither
benedick even to the next willow about your own business
 county what fashion will you wear the garland of
 about your neck like an usurer's chain or under
 your arm like a lieutenant's scarf you must wear
 it one way for the prince hath got your hero
claudio i wish him joy of her
benedick why that's spoken like an honest drovier so they
 sell bullocks but did you think the prince would
 have served you thus
claudio i pray you leave me
benedick ho now you strike like the blind man twas the
 boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post
claudio if it will not be i'll leave you
 exit
benedick alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges
 but that my lady beatrice should know me and not
 know me the prince's fool ha it may be i go
 under that title because i am merry yea but so i
 am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it
 is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice
 that puts the world into her person and so gives me
 out well i'll be revenged as i may
 reenter don pedro
don pedro now signior where's the count did you see him
benedick troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame
 i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
 warren i told him and i think i told him true
 that your grace had got the good will of this young
 lady and i offered him my company to a willowtree
 either to make him a garland as being forsaken or
 to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped
don pedro to be whipped what's his fault
benedick the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being
 overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his
 companion and he steals it
don pedro wilt thou make a trust a transgression the
 transgression is in the stealer
benedick yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made
 and the garland too for the garland he might have
 worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on
 you who as i take it have stolen his birds nest
don pedro i will but teach them to sing and restore them to
 the owner
benedick if their singing answer your saying by my faith
 you say honestly
don pedro the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the
 gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
 wronged by you
benedick o she misused me past the endurance of a block
 an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
 answered her my very visor began to assume life and
 scold with her she told me not thinking i had been
 myself that i was the prince's jester that i was
 duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest
 with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood
 like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at
 me she speaks poniards and every word stabs
 if her breath were as terrible as her terminations
 there were no living near her she would infect to
 the north star i would not marry her though she
 were endowed with all that adam bad left him before
 he transgressed she would have made hercules have
 turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make
 the fire too come talk not of her you shall find
 her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god
 some scholar would conjure her for certainly while
 she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
 sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they
 would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror
 and perturbation follows her
don pedro look here she comes
 enter claudio beatrice hero and leonato
benedick will your grace command me any service to the
 world's end i will go on the slightest errand now
 to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on
 i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the
 furthest inch of asia bring you the length of
 prester john's foot fetch you a hair off the great
 cham's beard do you any embassage to the pigmies
 rather than hold three words conference with this
 harpy you have no employment for me
don pedro none but to desire your good company
benedick o god sir here's a dish i love not i cannot
 endure my lady tongue
 exit
don pedro come lady come you have lost the heart of
 signior benedick
beatrice indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave
 him use for it a double heart for his single one
 marry once before he won it of me with false dice
 therefore your grace may well say i have lost it
don pedro you have put him down lady you have put him down
beatrice so i would not he should do me my lord lest i
 should prove the mother of fools i have brought
 count claudio whom you sent me to seek
don pedro why how now count wherefore are you sad
claudio not sad my lord
don pedro how then sick
claudio neither my lord
beatrice the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor
 well but civil count civil as an orange and
 something of that jealous complexion
don pedro i faith lady i think your blazon to be true
 though i'll be sworn if he be so his conceit is
 false here claudio i have wooed in thy name and
 fair hero is won i have broke with her father
 and his good will obtained name the day of
 marriage and god give thee joy
leonato count take of me my daughter and with her my
 fortunes his grace hath made the match and an
 grace say amen to it
beatrice speak count tis your cue
claudio silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were
 but little happy if i could say how much lady as
 you are mine i am yours i give away myself for
 you and dote upon the exchange
beatrice speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth
 with a kiss and let not him speak neither
don pedro in faith lady you have a merry heart
beatrice yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on
 the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his
 ear that he is in her heart
claudio and so she doth cousin
beatrice good lord for alliance thus goes every one to the
 world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a
 corner and cry heighho for a husband
don pedro lady beatrice i will get you one
beatrice i would rather have one of your father's getting
 hath your grace ne'er a brother like you your
 father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them
don pedro will you have me lady
beatrice no my lord unless i might have another for
 workingdays your grace is too costly to wear
 every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i
 was born to speak all mirth and no matter
don pedro your silence most offends me and to be merry best
 becomes you for out of question you were born in
 a merry hour
beatrice no sure my lord my mother cried but then there
 was a star danced and under that was i born
 cousins god give you joy
leonato niece will you look to those things i told you of
beatrice i cry you mercy uncle by your grace's pardon
 exit
don pedro by my troth a pleasantspirited lady
leonato there's little of the melancholy element in her my
 lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and
 not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say
 she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
 herself with laughing
don pedro she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband
leonato o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit
don pedro she were an excellent wife for benedict
leonato o lord my lord if they were but a week married
 they would talk themselves mad
don pedro county claudio when mean you to go to church
claudio tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love
 have all his rites
leonato not till monday my dear son which is hence a just
 sevennight and a time too brief too to have all
 things answer my mind
don pedro come you shake the head at so long a breathing
 but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go
 dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of
 hercules labours which is to bring signior
 benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of
 affection the one with the other i would fain have
 it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if
 you three will but minister such assistance as i
 shall give you direction
leonato my lord i am for you though it cost me ten
 nights watchings
claudio and i my lord
don pedro and you too gentle hero
hero i will do any modest office my lord to help my
 cousin to a good husband
don pedro and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
 i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble
 strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty i
 will teach you how to humour your cousin that she
 shall fall in love with benedick and i with your
 two helps will so practise on benedick that in
 despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he
 shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this
 cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be
 ours for we are the only lovegods go in with me
 and i will tell you my drift
 exeunt
 much ado about nothing
act ii
scene ii the same
 enter don john and borachio
don john it is so the count claudio shall marry the
 daughter of leonato
borachio yea my lord but i can cross it
don john any bar any cross any impediment will be
 medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him
 and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
 evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriage
borachio not honestly my lord but so covertly that no
 dishonesty shall appear in me
don john show me briefly how
borachio i think i told your lordship a year since how much
 i am in the favour of margaret the waiting
 gentlewoman to hero
don john i remember
borachio i can at any unseasonable instant of the night
 appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window
don john what life is in that to be the death of this marriage
borachio the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to
 the prince your brother spare not to tell him that
 he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
 claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold
 upto a contaminated stale such a one as hero
don john what proof shall i make of that
borachio proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio
 to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any
 other issue
don john only to despite them i will endeavour any thing
borachio go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and
 the count claudio alone tell them that you know
 that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the
 prince and claudio asin love of your brother's
 honour who hath made this match and his friend's
 reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the
 semblance of a maidthat you have discovered
 thus they will scarcely believe this without trial
 offer them instances which shall bear no less
 likelihood than to see me at her chamberwindow
 hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me
 claudio and bring them to see this the very night
 before the intended weddingfor in the meantime i
 will so fashion the matter that hero shall be
 absentand there shall appear such seeming truth
 of hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
 assurance and all the preparation overthrown
don john grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put

scene iii leonato's orchard
 enter benedick
benedick boy
 enter boy
boy signior
benedick in my chamberwindow lies a book bring it hither
 to me in the orchard
boy i am here already sir
benedick i know that but i would have thee hence and here again
 exit boy
 i do much wonder that one man seeing how much
 another man is a fool when he dedicates his
 behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at
 such shallow follies in others become the argument
 of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man
 is claudio i have known when there was no music
 with him but the drum and the fife and now had he
 rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known
 when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a
 good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake
 carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to
 speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man
 and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his
 words are a very fantastical banquet just so many
 strange dishes may i be so converted and see with
 these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not
 be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but
 i'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster
 of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman
 is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am
 well another virtuous yet i am well but till all
 graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in
 my grace rich she shall be that's certain wise
 or i'll none virtuous or i'll never cheapen her
 fair or i'll never look on her mild or come not
 near me noble or not i for an angel of good
 discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall
 be of what colour it please god ha the prince and
 monsieur love i will hide me in the arbour
 withdraws
 enter don pedro claudio and leonato
don pedro come shall we hear this music
claudio yea my good lord how still the evening is
 as hush'd on purpose to grace harmony
don pedro see you where benedick hath hid himself
claudio o very well my lord the music ended
 we'll fit the kidfox with a pennyworth
 enter balthasar with music
don pedro come balthasar we'll hear that song again
balthasar o good my lord tax not so bad a voice
 to slander music any more than once
don pedro it is the witness still of excellency
 to put a strange face on his own perfection
 i pray thee sing and let me woo no more
balthasar because you talk of wooing i will sing
 since many a wooer doth commence his suit
 to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes
 yet will he swear he loves
don pedro now pray thee come
 or if thou wilt hold longer argument
 do it in notes
balthasar note this before my notes
 there's not a note of mine that's worth the noting
don pedro why these are very crotchets that he speaks
 note notes forsooth and nothing
 air
benedick now divine air now is his soul ravished is it
 not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out
 of men's bodies well a horn for my money when
 all's done
 the song
balthasar sigh no more ladies sigh no more
 men were deceivers ever
 one foot in sea and one on shore
 to one thing constant never
 then sigh not so but let them go
 and be you blithe and bonny
 converting all your sounds of woe
 into hey nonny nonny
 sing no more ditties sing no moe
 of dumps so dull and heavy
 the fraud of men was ever so
 since summer first was leafy
 then sigh not so &c
don pedro by my troth a good song
balthasar and an ill singer my lord
don pedro ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift
benedick an he had been a dog that should have howled thus
 they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad
 voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the
 nightraven come what plague could have come after
 it
don pedro yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee
 get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we
 would have it at the lady hero's chamberwindow
balthasar the best i can my lord
don pedro do so farewell
 exit balthasar
 come hither leonato what was it you told me of
 today that your niece beatrice was in love with
 signior benedick
claudio o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did
 never think that lady would have loved any man
leonato no nor i neither but most wonderful that she
 should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in
 all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor
benedick is't possible sits the wind in that corner
leonato by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think
 of it but that she loves him with an enraged
 affection it is past the infinite of thought
don pedro may be she doth but counterfeit
claudio faith like enough
leonato o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of
 passion came so near the life of passion as she
 discovers it
don pedro why what effects of passion shows she
claudio bait the hook well this fish will bite
leonato what effects my lord she will sit you you heard
 my daughter tell you how
claudio she did indeed
don pedro how how pray you you amaze me i would have i
 thought her spirit had been invincible against all
 assaults of affection
leonato i would have sworn it had my lord especially
 against benedick
benedick i should think this a gull but that the
 whitebearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot
 sure hide himself in such reverence
claudio he hath ta'en the infection hold it up
don pedro hath she made her affection known to benedick
leonato no and swears she never will that's her torment
claudio tis true indeed so your daughter says shall
 i says she that have so oft encountered him
 with scorn write to him that i love him'
leonato this says she now when she is beginning to write to
 him for she'll be up twenty times a night and
 there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
 sheet of paper my daughter tells us all
claudio now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a
 pretty jest your daughter told us of
leonato o when she had writ it and was reading it over she
 found benedick and beatrice between the sheet
claudio that
leonato o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence
 railed at herself that she should be so immodest
 to write to one that she knew would flout her i
 measure him says she by my own spirit for i
 should flout him if he writ to me yea though i
 love him i should'
claudio then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs
 beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o
 sweet benedick god give me patience'
leonato she doth indeed my daughter says so and the
 ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
 is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
 to herself it is very true
don pedro it were good that benedick knew of it by some
 other if she will not discover it
claudio to what end he would make but a sport of it and
 torment the poor lady worse
don pedro an he should it were an alms to hang him she's an
 excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion
 she is virtuous
claudio and she is exceeding wise
don pedro in every thing but in loving benedick
leonato o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender
 a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
 the victory i am sorry for her as i have just
 cause being her uncle and her guardian
don pedro i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would
 have daffed all other respects and made her half
 myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear
 what a will say
leonato were it good think you
claudio hero thinks surely she will die for she says she
 will die if he love her not and she will die ere
 she make her love known and she will die if he woo
 her rather than she will bate one breath of her
 accustomed crossness
don pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her
 love tis very possible he'll scorn it for the
 man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit
claudio he is a very proper man
don pedro he hath indeed a good outward happiness
claudio before god and in my mind very wise
don pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit
claudio and i take him to be valiant
don pedro as hector i assure you and in the managing of
 quarrels you may say he is wise for either he
 avoids them with great discretion or undertakes
 them with a most christianlike fear
leonato if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace
 if he break the peace he ought to enter into a
 quarrel with fear and trembling
don pedro and so will he do for the man doth fear god
 howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
 he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall
 we go seek benedick and tell him of her love
claudio never tell him my lord let her wear it out with
 good counsel
leonato nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first
don pedro well we will hear further of it by your daughter
 let it cool the while i love benedick well and i
 could wish he would modestly examine himself to see
 how much he is unworthy so good a lady
leonato my lord will you walk dinner is ready
claudio if he do not dote on her upon this i will never
 trust my expectation
don pedro let there be the same net spread for her and that
 must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the
 sport will be when they hold one an opinion of
 another's dotage and no such matter that's the
 scene that i would see which will be merely a
 dumbshow let us send her to call him in to dinner
 exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato
benedick coming forward this can be no trick the
 conference was sadly borne they have the truth of
 this from hero they seem to pity the lady it
 seems her affections have their full bent love me
 why it must be requited i hear how i am censured
 they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive
 the love come from her they say too that she will
 rather die than give any sign of affection i did
 never think to marry i must not seem proud happy
 are they that hear their detractions and can put
 them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a
 truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis
 so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving
 me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor
 no great argument of her folly for i will be
 horribly in love with her i may chance have some
 odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me
 because i have railed so long against marriage but
 doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat
 in his youth that he cannot endure in his age
 shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
 the brain awe a man from the career of his humour
 no the world must be peopled when i said i would
 die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i
 were married here comes beatrice by this day
 she's a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in
 her
 enter beatrice
beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner
benedick fair beatrice i thank you for your pains
beatrice i took no more pains for those thanks than you take
 pains to thank me if it had been painful i would
 not have come
benedick you take pleasure then in the message
beatrice yea just so much as you may take upon a knife's
 point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach
 signior fare you well
 exit
benedick ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in
 to dinner there's a double meaning in that i took
 no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
 to thank me that's as much as to say any pains
 that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do
 not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not
 love her i am a jew i will go get her picture
 exit
 much ado about nothing
act iii
scene i leonato's garden
 enter hero margaret and ursula
hero good margaret run thee to the parlor
 there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice
 proposing with the prince and claudio
 whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula
 walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
 is all of her say that thou overheard'st us
 and bid her steal into the pleached bower
 where honeysuckles ripen'd by the sun
 forbid the sun to enter like favourites
 made proud by princes that advance their pride
 against that power that bred it there will she hide her
 to listen our purpose this is thy office
 bear thee well in it and leave us alone
margaret i'll make her come i warrant you presently
 exit
hero now ursula when beatrice doth come
 as we do trace this alley up and down
 our talk must only be of benedick
 when i do name him let it be thy part
 to praise him more than ever man did merit
 my talk to thee must be how benedick
 is sick in love with beatrice of this matter
 is little cupid's crafty arrow made
 that only wounds by hearsay
 enter beatrice behind
 now begin
 for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs
 close by the ground to hear our conference
ursula the pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
 cut with her golden oars the silver stream
 and greedily devour the treacherous bait
 so angle we for beatrice who even now
 is couched in the woodbine coverture
 fear you not my part of the dialogue
hero then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
 of the false sweet bait that we lay for it
 approaching the bower
 no truly ursula she is too disdainful
 i know her spirits are as coy and wild
 as haggerds of the rock
ursula but are you sure
 that benedick loves beatrice so entirely
hero so says the prince and my newtrothed lord
ursula and did they bid you tell her of it madam
hero they did entreat me to acquaint her of it
 but i persuaded them if they loved benedick
 to wish him wrestle with affection
 and never to let beatrice know of it
ursula why did you so doth not the gentleman
 deserve as full as fortunate a bed
 as ever beatrice shall couch upon
hero o god of love i know he doth deserve
 as much as may be yielded to a man
 but nature never framed a woman's heart
 of prouder stuff than that of beatrice
 disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
 misprising what they look on and her wit
 values itself so highly that to her
 all matter else seems weak she cannot love
 nor take no shape nor project of affection
 she is so selfendeared
ursula sure i think so
 and therefore certainly it were not good
 she knew his love lest she make sport at it
hero why you speak truth i never yet saw man
 how wise how noble young how rarely featured
 but she would spell him backward if fairfaced
 she would swear the gentleman should be her sister
 if black why nature drawing of an antique
 made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded
 if low an agate very vilely cut
 if speaking why a vane blown with all winds
 if silent why a block moved with none
 so turns she every man the wrong side out
 and never gives to truth and virtue that
 which simpleness and merit purchaseth
ursula sure sure such carping is not commendable
hero no not to be so odd and from all fashions
 as beatrice is cannot be commendable
 but who dare tell her so if i should speak
 she would mock me into air o she would laugh me
 out of myself press me to death with wit
 therefore let benedick like cover'd fire
 consume away in sighs waste inwardly
 it were a better death than die with mocks
 which is as bad as die with tickling
ursula yet tell her of it hear what she will say
hero no rather i will go to benedick
 and counsel him to fight against his passion
 and truly i'll devise some honest slanders
 to stain my cousin with one doth not know
 how much an ill word may empoison liking
ursula o do not do your cousin such a wrong
 she cannot be so much without true judgment
 having so swift and excellent a wit
 as she is prized to haveas to refuse
 so rare a gentleman as signior benedick
hero he is the only man of italy
 always excepted my dear claudio
ursula i pray you be not angry with me madam
 speaking my fancy signior benedick
 for shape for bearing argument and valour
 goes foremost in report through italy
hero indeed he hath an excellent good name
ursula his excellence did earn it ere he had it
 when are you married madam
hero why every day tomorrow come go in
 i'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel
 which is the best to furnish me tomorrow
ursula she's limed i warrant you we have caught her madam
hero if it proves so then loving goes by haps
 some cupid kills with arrows some with traps
 exeunt hero and ursula
beatrice coming forward
 what fire is in mine ears can this be true
 stand i condemn'd for pride and scorn so much
 contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
 no glory lives behind the back of such
 and benedick love on i will requite thee
 taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
 if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
 to bind our loves up in a holy band
 for others say thou dost deserve and i
 believe it better than reportingly

act iii
scene ii a room in leonato's house
 enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato
don pedro i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and
 then go i toward arragon
claudio i'll bring you thither my lord if you'll
 vouchsafe me
don pedro nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
 of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
 and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold
 with benedick for his company for from the crown
 of his head to the sole of his foot he is all
 mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid's
 bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at
 him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
 tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his
 tongue speaks
benedick gallants i am not as i have been
leonato so say i methinks you are sadder
claudio i hope he be in love
don pedro hang him truant there's no true drop of blood in
 him to be truly touched with love if he be sad
 he wants money
benedick i have the toothache
don pedro draw it
benedick hang it
claudio you must hang it first and draw it afterwards
don pedro what sigh for the toothache
leonato where is but a humour or a worm
benedick well every one can master a grief but he that has
 it
claudio yet say i he is in love
don pedro there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be
 a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be
 a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the
 shape of two countries at once as a german from
 the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from
 the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy
 to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no
 fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is
claudio if he be not in love with some woman there is no
 believing old signs a brushes his hat o'
 mornings what should that bode
don pedro hath any man seen him at the barber's
claudio no but the barber's man hath been seen with him
 and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
 stuffed tennisballs
leonato indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard
don pedro nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him
 out by that
claudio that's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love
don pedro the greatest note of it is his melancholy
claudio and when was he wont to wash his face
don pedro yea or to paint himself for the which i hear
 what they say of him
claudio nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into
 a lutestring and now governed by stops
don pedro indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude
 conclude he is in love
claudio nay but i know who loves him
don pedro that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not
claudio yes and his ill conditions and in despite of
 all dies for him
don pedro she shall be buried with her face upwards
benedick yet is this no charm for the toothache old
 signior walk aside with me i have studied eight
 or nine wise words to speak to you which these
 hobbyhorses must not hear
 exeunt benedick and leonato
don pedro for my life to break with him about beatrice
claudio tis even so hero and margaret have by this
 played their parts with beatrice and then the two
 bears will not bite one another when they meet
 enter don john
don john my lord and brother god save you
don pedro good den brother
don john if your leisure served i would speak with you
don pedro in private
don john if it please you yet count claudio may hear for
 what i would speak of concerns him
don pedro what's the matter
don john to claudio means your lordship to be married
 tomorrow
don pedro you know he does
don john i know not that when he knows what i know
claudio if there be any impediment i pray you discover it
don john you may think i love you not let that appear
 hereafter and aim better at me by that i now will
 manifest for my brother i think he holds you
 well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
 your ensuing marriagesurely suit ill spent and
 labour ill bestowed
don pedro why what's the matter
don john i came hither to tell you and circumstances
 shortened for she has been too long a talking of
 the lady is disloyal
claudio who hero
don pedro even she leonato's hero your hero every man's hero
claudio disloyal
don john the word is too good to paint out her wickedness i
 could say she were worse think you of a worse
 title and i will fit her to it wonder not till
 further warrant go but with me tonight you shall
 see her chamberwindow entered even the night
 before her weddingday if you love her then
 tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour
 to change your mind
claudio may this be so
don pedro i will not think it
don john if you dare not trust that you see confess not
 that you know if you will follow me i will show
 you enough and when you have seen more and heard
 more proceed accordingly
claudio if i see any thing tonight why i should not marry
 her tomorrow in the congregation where i should
 wed there will i shame her
don pedro and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join
 with thee to disgrace her
don john i will disparage her no farther till you are my
 witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and
 let the issue show itself
don pedro o day untowardly turned
claudio o mischief strangely thwarting
don john o plague right well prevented so will you say when
 you have seen the sequel

scene iii a street
 enter dogberry and verges with the watch
dogberry are you good men and true
verges yea or else it were pity but they should suffer
 salvation body and soul
dogberry nay that were a punishment too good for them if
 they should have any allegiance in them being
 chosen for the prince's watch
verges well give them their charge neighbour dogberry
dogberry first who think you the most desertless man to be
 constable
first watchman hugh otecake sir or george seacole for they can
 write and read
dogberry come hither neighbour seacole god hath blessed
 you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is
 the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature
second watchman both which master constable
dogberry you have i knew it would be your answer well
 for your favour sir why give god thanks and make
 no boast of it and for your writing and reading
 let that appear when there is no need of such
 vanity you are thought here to be the most
 senseless and fit man for the constable of the
 watch therefore bear you the lantern this is your
 charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are
 to bid any man stand in the prince's name
second watchman how if a will not stand
dogberry why then take no note of him but let him go and
 presently call the rest of the watch together and
 thank god you are rid of a knave
verges if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none
 of the prince's subjects
dogberry true and they are to meddle with none but the
 prince's subjects you shall also make no noise in
 the streets for for the watch to babble and to
 talk is most tolerable and not to be endured
watchman we will rather sleep than talk we know what
 belongs to a watch
dogberry why you speak like an ancient and most quiet
 watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should
 offend only have a care that your bills be not
 stolen well you are to call at all the
 alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed
watchman how if they will not
dogberry why then let them alone till they are sober if
 they make you not then the better answer you may
 say they are not the men you took them for
watchman well sir
dogberry if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue
 of your office to be no true man and for such
 kind of men the less you meddle or make with them
 why the more is for your honesty
watchman if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay
 hands on him
dogberry truly by your office you may but i think they
 that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable
 way for you if you do take a thief is to let him
 show himself what he is and steal out of your company
verges you have been always called a merciful man partner
dogberry truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more
 a man who hath any honesty in him
verges if you hear a child cry in the night you must call
 to the nurse and bid her still it
watchman how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us
dogberry why then depart in peace and let the child wake
 her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her
 lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats
verges tis very true
dogberry this is the end of the chargeyou constable are
 to present the prince's own person if you meet the
 prince in the night you may stay him
verges nay by'r our lady that i think a cannot
dogberry five shillings to one on't with any man that knows
 the statutes he may stay him marry not without
 the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought
 to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a
 man against his will
verges by'r lady i think it be so
dogberry ha ha ha well masters good night an there be
 any matter of weight chances call up me keep your
 fellows counsels and your own and good night
 come neighbour
watchman well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here
 upon the churchbench till two and then all to bed
dogberry one word more honest neighbours i pray you watch
 about signior leonato's door for the wedding being
 there tomorrow there is a great coil tonight
 adieu be vigitant i beseech you
 exeunt dogberry and verges
 enter borachio and conrade
borachio what conrade
watchman aside peace stir not
borachio conrade i say
conrade here man i am at thy elbow
borachio mass and my elbow itched i thought there would a
 scab follow
conrade i will owe thee an answer for that and now forward
 with thy tale
borachio stand thee close then under this penthouse for
 it drizzles rain and i will like a true drunkard
 utter all to thee
watchman aside some treason masters yet stand close
borachio therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats
conrade is it possible that any villany should be so dear
borachio thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
 villany should be so rich for when rich villains
 have need of poor ones poor ones may make what
 price they will
conrade i wonder at it
borachio that shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that
 the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is
 nothing to a man
conrade yes it is apparel
borachio i mean the fashion
conrade yes the fashion is the fashion
borachio tush i may as well say the fool's the fool but
 seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
 is
watchman aside i know that deformed a has been a vile
 thief this seven year a goes up and down like a
 gentleman i remember his name
borachio didst thou not hear somebody
conrade no twas the vane on the house
borachio seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this
 fashion is how giddily a turns about all the hot
 bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty
 sometimes fashioning them like pharaoh's soldiers
 in the reeky painting sometime like god bel's
 priests in the old churchwindow sometime like the
 shaven hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry
 where his codpiece seems as massy as his club
conrade all this i see and i see that the fashion wears
 out more apparel than the man but art not thou
 thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast
 shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion
borachio not so neither but know that i have tonight
 wooed margaret the lady hero's gentlewoman by the
 name of hero she leans me out at her mistress'
 chamberwindow bids me a thousand times good
 nighti tell this tale vilelyi should first
 tell thee how the prince claudio and my master
 planted and placed and possessed by my master don
 john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter
conrade and thought they margaret was hero
borachio two of them did the prince and claudio but the
 devil my master knew she was margaret and partly
 by his oaths which first possessed them partly by
 the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly
 by my villany which did confirm any slander that
 don john had made away went claudio enraged swore
 he would meet her as he was appointed next morning
 at the temple and there before the whole
 congregation shame her with what he saw o'er night
 and send her home again without a husband
first watchman we charge you in the prince's name stand
second watchman call up the right master constable we have here
 recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
 ever was known in the commonwealth
first watchman and one deformed is one of them i know him a'
 wears a lock
conrade masters masters
second watchman you'll be made bring deformed forth i warrant you
conrade masters
first watchman never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us
borachio we are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken
 up of these men's bills
conrade a commodity in question i warrant you come we'll obey you

act iv
scene i a church
 enter don pedro don john leonato friar francis
 claudio benedick hero beatrice and attendants
leonato come friar francis be brief only to the plain
 form of marriage and you shall recount their
 particular duties afterwards
friar francis you come hither my lord to marry this lady
claudio no
leonato to be married to her friar you come to marry her
friar francis lady you come hither to be married to this count
hero i do
friar francis if either of you know any inward impediment why you
 should not be conjoined charge you on your souls
 to utter it
claudio know you any hero
hero none my lord
friar francis know you any count
leonato i dare make his answer none
claudio o what men dare do what men may do what men daily
 do not knowing what they do
benedick how now interjections why then some be of
 laughing as ah ha he
claudio stand thee by friar father by your leave
 will you with free and unconstrained soul
 give me this maid your daughter
leonato as freely son as god did give her me
claudio and what have i to give you back whose worth
 may counterpoise this rich and precious gift
don pedro nothing unless you render her again
claudio sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness
 there leonato take her back again
 give not this rotten orange to your friend
 she's but the sign and semblance of her honour
 behold how like a maid she blushes here
 o what authority and show of truth
 can cunning sin cover itself withal
 comes not that blood as modest evidence
 to witness simple virtue would you not swear
 all you that see her that she were a maid
 by these exterior shows but she is none
 she knows the heat of a luxurious bed
 her blush is guiltiness not modesty
leonato what do you mean my lord
claudio not to be married
 not to knit my soul to an approved wanton
leonato dear my lord if you in your own proof
 have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth
 and made defeat of her virginity
claudio i know what you would say if i have known her
 you will say she did embrace me as a husband
 and so extenuate the forehand sin
 no leonato
 i never tempted her with word too large
 but as a brother to his sister show'd
 bashful sincerity and comely love
hero and seem'd i ever otherwise to you
claudio out on thee seeming i will write against it
 you seem to me as dian in her orb
 as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
 but you are more intemperate in your blood
 than venus or those pamper'd animals
 that rage in savage sensuality
hero is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
leonato sweet prince why speak not you
don pedro what should i speak
 i stand dishonour'd that have gone about
 to link my dear friend to a common stale
leonato are these things spoken or do i but dream
don john sir they are spoken and these things are true
benedick this looks not like a nuptial
hero true o god
claudio leonato stand i here
 is this the prince is this the prince's brother
 is this face hero's are our eyes our own
leonato all this is so but what of this my lord
claudio let me but move one question to your daughter
 and by that fatherly and kindly power
 that you have in her bid her answer truly
leonato i charge thee do so as thou art my child
hero o god defend me how am i beset
 what kind of catechising call you this
claudio to make you answer truly to your name
hero is it not hero who can blot that name
 with any just reproach
claudio marry that can hero
 hero itself can blot out hero's virtue
 what man was he talk'd with you yesternight
 out at your window betwixt twelve and one
 now if you are a maid answer to this
hero i talk'd with no man at that hour my lord
don pedro why then are you no maiden leonato
 i am sorry you must hear upon mine honour
 myself my brother and this grieved count
 did see her hear her at that hour last night
 talk with a ruffian at her chamberwindow
 who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
 confess'd the vile encounters they have had
 a thousand times in secret
don john fie fie they are not to be named my lord
 not to be spoke of
 there is not chastity enough in language
 without offence to utter them thus pretty lady
 i am sorry for thy much misgovernment
claudio o hero what a hero hadst thou been
 if half thy outward graces had been placed
 about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
 but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell
 thou pure impiety and impious purity
 for thee i'll lock up all the gates of love
 and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
 to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
 and never shall it more be gracious
leonato hath no man's dagger here a point for me
 hero swoons
beatrice why how now cousin wherefore sink you down
don john come let us go these things come thus to light
 smother her spirits up
 exeunt don pedro don john and claudio
benedick how doth the lady
beatrice dead i think help uncle
 hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar
leonato o fate take not away thy heavy hand
 death is the fairest cover for her shame
 that may be wish'd for
beatrice how now cousin hero
friar francis have comfort lady
leonato dost thou look up
friar francis yea wherefore should she not
leonato wherefore why doth not every earthly thing
 cry shame upon her could she here deny
 the story that is printed in her blood
 do not live hero do not ope thine eyes
 for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die
 thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
 myself would on the rearward of reproaches
 strike at thy life grieved i i had but one
 chid i for that at frugal nature's frame
 o one too much by thee why had i one
 why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
 why had i not with charitable hand
 took up a beggar's issue at my gates
 who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy
 i might have said no part of it is mine
 this shame derives itself from unknown loins'
 but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised
 and mine that i was proud on mine so much
 that i myself was to myself not mine
 valuing of herwhy she o she is fallen
 into a pit of ink that the wide sea
 hath drops too few to wash her clean again
 and salt too little which may season give
 to her foultainted flesh
benedick sir sir be patient
 for my part i am so attired in wonder
 i know not what to say
beatrice o on my soul my cousin is belied
benedick lady were you her bedfellow last night
beatrice no truly not although until last night
 i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
leonato confirm'd confirm'd o that is stronger made
 which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron
 would the two princes lie and claudio lie
 who loved her so that speaking of her foulness
 wash'd it with tears hence from her let her die
friar francis hear me a little for i have only been
 silent so long and given way unto
 this course of fortune 
 by noting of the lady i have mark'd
 a thousand blushing apparitions
 to start into her face a thousand innocent shames
 in angel whiteness beat away those blushes
 and in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
 to burn the errors that these princes hold
 against her maiden truth call me a fool
 trust not my reading nor my observations
 which with experimental seal doth warrant
 the tenor of my book trust not my age
 my reverence calling nor divinity
 if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
 under some biting error
leonato friar it cannot be
 thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
 is that she will not add to her damnation
 a sin of perjury she not denies it
 why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
 that which appears in proper nakedness
friar francis lady what man is he you are accused of
hero they know that do accuse me i know none
 if i know more of any man alive
 than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
 let all my sins lack mercy o my father
 prove you that any man with me conversed
 at hours unmeet or that i yesternight
 maintain'd the change of words with any creature
 refuse me hate me torture me to death
friar francis there is some strange misprision in the princes
benedick two of them have the very bent of honour
 and if their wisdoms be misled in this
 the practise of it lives in john the bastard
 whose spirits toil in frame of villanies
leonato i know not if they speak but truth of her
 these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour
 the proudest of them shall well hear of it
 time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
 nor age so eat up my invention
 nor fortune made such havoc of my means
 nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
 but they shall find awaked in such a kind
 both strength of limb and policy of mind
 ability in means and choice of friends
 to quit me of them throughly
friar francis pause awhile
 and let my counsel sway you in this case
 your daughter here the princes left for dead
 let her awhile be secretly kept in
 and publish it that she is dead indeed
 maintain a mourning ostentation
 and on your family's old monument
 hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
 that appertain unto a burial
leonato what shall become of this what will this do
friar francis marry this well carried shall on her behalf
 change slander to remorse that is some good
 but not for that dream i on this strange course
 but on this travail look for greater birth
 she dying as it must so be maintain'd
 upon the instant that she was accused
 shall be lamented pitied and excused
 of every hearer for it so falls out
 that what we have we prize not to the worth
 whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost
 why then we rack the value then we find
 the virtue that possession would not show us
 whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio
 when he shall hear she died upon his words
 the idea of her life shall sweetly creep
 into his study of imagination
 and every lovely organ of her life
 shall come apparell'd in more precious habit
 more movingdelicate and full of life
 into the eye and prospect of his soul
 than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn
 if ever love had interest in his liver
 and wish he had not so accused her
 no though he thought his accusation true
 let this be so and doubt not but success
 will fashion the event in better shape
 than i can lay it down in likelihood
 but if all aim but this be levell'd false
 the supposition of the lady's death
 will quench the wonder of her infamy
 and if it sort not well you may conceal her
 as best befits her wounded reputation
 in some reclusive and religious life
 out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
benedick signior leonato let the friar advise you
 and though you know my inwardness and love
 is very much unto the prince and claudio
 yet by mine honour i will deal in this
 as secretly and justly as your soul
 should with your body
leonato being that i flow in grief
 the smallest twine may lead me
friar francis tis well consented presently away
 for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
 come lady die to live this weddingday
 perhaps is but prolong'd have patience and endure
 exeunt all but benedick and beatrice
benedick lady beatrice have you wept all this while
beatrice yea and i will weep a while longer
benedick i will not desire that
beatrice you have no reason i do it freely
benedick surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged
beatrice ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her
benedick is there any way to show such friendship
beatrice a very even way but no such friend
benedick may a man do it
beatrice it is a man's office but not yours
benedick i do love nothing in the world so well as you is
 not that strange
beatrice as strange as the thing i know not it were as
 possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as
 you but believe me not and yet i lie not i
 confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin
benedick by my sword beatrice thou lovest me
beatrice do not swear and eat it
benedick i will swear by it that you love me and i will make
 him eat it that says i love not you
beatrice will you not eat your word
benedick with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest
 i love thee
beatrice why then god forgive me
benedick what offence sweet beatrice
beatrice you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to
 protest i loved you
benedick and do it with all thy heart
beatrice i love you with so much of my heart that none is
 left to protest
benedick come bid me do any thing for thee
beatrice kill claudio
benedick ha not for the wide world
beatrice you kill me to deny it farewell
benedick tarry sweet beatrice
beatrice i am gone though i am here there is no love in
 you nay i pray you let me go
benedick beatrice
beatrice in faith i will go
benedick we'll be friends first
beatrice you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy
benedick is claudio thine enemy
beatrice is he not approved in the height a villain that
 hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o
 that i were a man what bear her in hand until they
 come to take hands and then with public
 accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour
 o god that i were a man i would eat his heart
 in the marketplace
benedick hear me beatrice
beatrice talk with a man out at a window a proper saying
benedick nay but beatrice
beatrice sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone
benedick beat
beatrice princes and counties surely a princely testimony
 a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant
 surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i
 had any friend would be a man for my sake but
 manhood is melted into courtesies valour into
 compliment and men are only turned into tongue and
 trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules
 that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a
 man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving
benedick tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee
beatrice use it for my love some other way than swearing by it
benedick think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero
beatrice yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul
benedick enough i am engaged i will challenge him i will
 kiss your hand and so i leave you by this hand
 claudio shall render me a dear account as you
 hear of me so think of me go comfort your
 cousin i must say she is dead and so farewell

 much ado about nothing
act v
scene i before leonato's house
 enter leonato and antonio
antonio if you go on thus you will kill yourself
 and tis not wisdom thus to second grief
 against yourself
leonato i pray thee cease thy counsel
 which falls into mine ears as profitless
 as water in a sieve give not me counsel
 nor let no comforter delight mine ear
 but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
 bring me a father that so loved his child
 whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine
 and bid him speak of patience
 measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
 and let it answer every strain for strain
 as thus for thus and such a grief for such
 in every lineament branch shape and form
 if such a one will smile and stroke his beard
 bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan
 patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
 with candlewasters bring him yet to me
 and i of him will gather patience
 but there is no such man for brother men
 can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
 which they themselves not feel but tasting it
 their counsel turns to passion which before
 would give preceptial medicine to rage
 fetter strong madness in a silken thread
 charm ache with air and agony with words
 no no tis all men's office to speak patience
 to those that wring under the load of sorrow
 but no man's virtue nor sufficiency
 to be so moral when he shall endure
 the like himself therefore give me no counsel
 my griefs cry louder than advertisement
antonio therein do men from children nothing differ
leonato i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood
 for there was never yet philosopher
 that could endure the toothache patiently
 however they have writ the style of gods
 and made a push at chance and sufferance
antonio yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
 make those that do offend you suffer too
leonato there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so
 my soul doth tell me hero is belied
 and that shall claudio know so shall the prince
 and all of them that thus dishonour her
antonio here comes the prince and claudio hastily
 enter don pedro and claudio

 some of us would lie low
claudio who wrongs him
leonato marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
 nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword
 i fear thee not
claudio marry beshrew my hand
 if it should give your age such cause of fear
 in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword
leonato tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
 i speak not like a dotard nor a fool
 as under privilege of age to brag
 what i have done being young or what would do
 were i not old know claudio to thy head
 thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
 that i am forced to lay my reverence by
 and with grey hairs and bruise of many days
 do challenge thee to trial of a man
 i say thou hast belied mine innocent child
 thy slander hath gone through and through her heart
 and she lies buried with her ancestors
 o in a tomb where never scandal slept
 save this of hers framed by thy villany
claudio my villany
leonato thine claudio thine i say
don pedro you say not right old man
leonato my lord my lord
 i'll prove it on his body if he dare
 despite his nice fence and his active practise
 his may of youth and bloom of lustihood
claudio away i will not have to do with you
leonato canst thou so daff me thou hast kill'd my child
 if thou kill'st me boy thou shalt kill a man
antonio he shall kill two of us and men indeed
 but that's no matter let him kill one first
 win me and wear me let him answer me
 come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me
 sir boy i'll whip you from your foining fence
 nay as i am a gentleman i will
leonato brother
antonio content yourself god knows i loved my niece
 and she is dead slander'd to death by villains
 that dare as well answer a man indeed
 as i dare take a serpent by the tongue
 boys apes braggarts jacks milksops
leonato brother antony
antonio hold you content what man i know them yea
 and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple
 scrambling outfacing fashionmonging boys
 that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander
 go anticly show outward hideousness
 and speak off half a dozen dangerous words
 how they might hurt their enemies if they durst
 and this is all
leonato but brother antony
antonio come tis no matter
 do not you meddle let me deal in this
don pedro gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
 my heart is sorry for your daughter's death
 but on my honour she was charged with nothing
 but what was true and very full of proof
leonato my lord my lord
don pedro i will not hear you
leonato no come brother away i will be heard
antonio and shall or some of us will smart for it
 exeunt leonato and antonio
don pedro see see here comes the man we went to seek
 enter benedick
claudio now signior what news
benedick good day my lord
don pedro welcome signior you are almost come to part
 almost a fray
claudio we had like to have had our two noses snapped off
 with two old men without teeth
don pedro leonato and his brother what thinkest thou had
 we fought i doubt we should have been too young for them
benedick in a false quarrel there is no true valour i came
 to seek you both
claudio we have been up and down to seek thee for we are
 highproof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
 away wilt thou use thy wit
benedick it is in my scabbard shall i draw it
don pedro dost thou wear thy wit by thy side
claudio never any did so though very many have been beside
 their wit i will bid thee draw as we do the
 minstrels draw to pleasure us
don pedro as i am an honest man he looks pale art thou
 sick or angry
claudio what courage man what though care killed a cat
 thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care
benedick sir i shall meet your wit in the career and you
 charge it against me i pray you choose another subject
claudio nay then give him another staff this last was
 broke cross
don pedro by this light he changes more and more i think
 he be angry indeed
claudio if he be he knows how to turn his girdle
benedick shall i speak a word in your ear
claudio god bless me from a challenge
benedick aside to claudio you are a villain i jest not
 i will make it good how you dare with what you
 dare and when you dare do me right or i will
 protest your cowardice you have killed a sweet
 lady and her death shall fall heavy on you let me
 hear from you
claudio well i will meet you so i may have good cheer
don pedro what a feast a feast
claudio i faith i thank him he hath bid me to a calf's
 head and a capon the which if i do not carve most
 curiously say my knife's naught shall i not find
 a woodcock too
benedick sir your wit ambles well it goes easily
don pedro i'll tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the
 other day i said thou hadst a fine wit true'
 said she a fine little one no said i a
 great wit right says she a great gross one'
 nay said i a good wit just said she it
 hurts nobody nay said i the gentleman
 is wise certain said she a wise gentleman'
 nay said i he hath the tongues that i
 believe said she for he swore a thing to me on
 monday night which he forswore on tuesday morning
 there's a double tongue there's two tongues thus
 did she an hour together transshape thy particular
 virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou
 wast the properest man in italy
claudio for the which she wept heartily and said she cared
 not
don pedro yea that she did but yet for all that an if she
 did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly
 the old man's daughter told us all
claudio all all and moreover god saw him when he was
 hid in the garden
don pedro but when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
 the sensible benedick's head
claudio yea and text underneath here dwells benedick the
 married man'
benedick fare you well boy you know my mind i will leave
 you now to your gossiplike humour you break jests
 as braggarts do their blades which god be thanked

 the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero's
 garments how you disgraced her when you should
 marry her my villany they have upon record which

 master's false accusation and briefly i desire
 nothing but the reward of a villain

benedick pray thee sweet mistress margaret deserve well at
 my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice
margaret will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty
benedick in so high a style margaret that no man living
 shall come over it for in most comely truth thou
 deservest it
margaret to have no man come over me why shall i always
 keep below stairs
benedick thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth it catches
margaret and yours as blunt as the fencer's foils which hit
 but hurt not
benedick a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a
 woman and so i pray thee call beatrice i give
 thee the bucklers
margaret give us the swords we have bucklers of our own
benedick if you use them margaret you must put in the
 pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids
margaret well i will call beatrice to you who i think hath legs
benedick and therefore will come
 exit margaret
 sings
 the god of love
 that sits above
 and knows me and knows me
 how pitiful i deserve
 i mean in singing but in loving leander the good
 swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and
 a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmangers
 whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
 blank verse why they were never so truly turned
 over and over as my poor self in love marry i
 cannot show it in rhyme i have tried i can find
 out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent
 rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for
 school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous
 endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet
 nor i cannot woo in festival terms
 enter beatrice
 sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee
beatrice yea signior and depart when you bid me
benedick o stay but till then
beatrice then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere
 i go let me go with that i came which is with
 knowing what hath passed between you and claudio
benedick only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee
beatrice foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but
 foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i
 will depart unkissed
benedick thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense
 so forcible is thy wit but i must tell thee
 plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either
 i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe
 him a coward and i pray thee now tell me for
 which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
beatrice for them all together which maintained so politic
 a state of evil that they will not admit any good
 part to intermingle with them but for which of my
 good parts did you first suffer love for me
benedick suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love
 indeed for i love thee against my will
beatrice in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart
 if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for
 yours for i will never love that which my friend hates
benedick thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably
beatrice it appears not in this confession there's not one
 wise man among twenty that will praise himself
benedick an old an old instance beatrice that lived in
 the lime of good neighbours if a man do not erect
 in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live
 no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
 widow weeps
beatrice and how long is that think you
benedick question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in
 rheum therefore is it most expedient for the
 wise if don worm his conscience find no
 impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his
 own virtues as i am to myself so much for
 praising myself who i myself will bear witness is
 praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin
beatrice very ill
benedick and how do you
beatrice very ill too
benedick serve god love me and mend there will i leave
 you too for here comes one in haste
 enter ursula
ursula madam you must come to your uncle yonder's old
 coil at home it is proved my lady hero hath been

 enter leonato antonio benedick beatrice
 margaret ursula friar francis and hero
friar francis did i not tell you she was innocent
leonato so are the prince and claudio who accused her
 upon the error that you heard debated
 but margaret was in some fault for this
 although against her will as it appears
 in the true course of all the question
antonio well i am glad that all things sort so well
benedick and so am i being else by faith enforced
 to call young claudio to a reckoning for it
leonato well daughter and you gentlewomen all
 withdraw into a chamber by yourselves
 and when i send for you come hither mask'd
 exeunt ladies
 the prince and claudio promised by this hour
 to visit me you know your office brother
 you must be father to your brother's daughter
 and give her to young claudio
antonio which i will do with confirm'd countenance
benedick friar i must entreat your pains i think
friar francis to do what signior
benedick to bind me or undo me one of them
 signior leonato truth it is good signior
 your niece regards me with an eye of favour
leonato that eye my daughter lent her tis most true
benedick and i do with an eye of love requite her
leonato the sight whereof i think you had from me
 from claudio and the prince but what's your will
benedick your answer sir is enigmatical
 but for my will my will is your good will
 may stand with ours this day to be conjoin'd
 in the state of honourable marriage
 in which good friar i shall desire your help
leonato my heart is with your liking
friar francis and my help
 here comes the prince and claudio
 enter don pedro and claudio and two or
 three others
don pedro good morrow to this fair assembly
leonato good morrow prince good morrow claudio

 today to marry with my brother's daughter
claudio i'll hold my mind were she an ethiope
leonato call her forth brother here's the friar ready
 exit antonio
don pedro good morrow benedick why what's the matter
 that you have such a february face
 so full of frost of storm and cloudiness
claudio i think he thinks upon the savage bull
 tush fear not man we'll tip thy horns with gold
 and all europa shall rejoice at thee
 as once europa did at lusty jove
 when he would play the noble beast in love
benedick bull jove sir had an amiable low
 and some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow
 and got a calf in that same noble feat
 much like to you for you have just his bleat
claudio for this i owe you here comes other reckonings
 reenter antonio with the ladies masked
 which is the lady i must seize upon
antonio this same is she and i do give you her
claudio why then she's mine sweet let me see your face
leonato no that you shall not till you take her hand
 before this friar and swear to marry her
claudio give me your hand before this holy friar
 i am your husband if you like of me
hero and when i lived i was your other wife
 unmasking
 and when you loved you were my other husband
claudio another hero
hero nothing certainer
 one hero died defiled but i do live
 and surely as i live i am a maid
don pedro the former hero hero that is dead
leonato she died my lord but whiles her slander lived
friar francis all this amazement can i qualify
 when after that the holy rites are ended
 i'll tell you largely of fair hero's death
 meantime let wonder seem familiar
 and to the chapel let us presently
benedick soft and fair friar which is beatrice
beatrice unmasking i answer to that name what is your will
benedick do not you love me
beatrice why no no more than reason
benedick why then your uncle and the prince and claudio
 have been deceived they swore you did
beatrice do not you love me
benedick troth no no more than reason
beatrice why then my cousin margaret and ursula
 are much deceived for they did swear you did
benedick they swore that you were almost sick for me
beatrice they swore that you were wellnigh dead for me
benedick tis no such matter then you do not love me
beatrice no truly but in friendly recompense
leonato come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman
claudio and i'll be sworn upon't that he loves her
 for here's a paper written in his hand
 a halting sonnet of his own pure brain
 fashion'd to beatrice
hero and here's another
 writ in my cousin's hand stolen from her pocket
 containing her affection unto benedick
benedick a miracle here's our own hands against our hearts
 come i will have thee but by this light i take
 thee for pity
beatrice i would not deny you but by this good day i yield
 upon great persuasion and partly to save your life
 for i was told you were in a consumption
benedick peace i will stop your mouth
 kissing her
don pedro how dost thou benedick the married man
benedick i'll tell thee what prince a college of
 witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour dost
 thou think i care for a satire or an epigram no
 if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear
 nothing handsome about him in brief since i do
 purpose to marry i will think nothing to any
 purpose that the world can say against it and
 therefore never flout at me for what i have said
 against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my
 conclusion for thy part claudio i did think to
 have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my
 kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin
claudio i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice
 that i might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
 life to make thee a doubledealer which out of
 question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look
 exceedingly narrowly to thee
benedick come come we are friends let's have a dance ere
 we are married that we may lighten our own hearts
 and our wives heels
leonato we'll have dancing afterward
benedick first of my word therefore play music prince
 thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife
 there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord your brother john is ta'en in flight
 and brought with armed men back to messina

scene dispersedly in various countries
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
 enter gower
 before the palace of antioch
 to sing a song that old was sung
 from ashes ancient gower is come
 assuming man's infirmities
 to glad your ear and please your eyes
 it hath been sung at festivals
 on embereves and holyales
 and lords and ladies in their lives
 have read it for restoratives
 the purchase is to make men glorious
 et bonum quo antiquius eo melius
 if you born in these latter times
 when wit's more ripe accept my rhymes
 and that to hear an old man sing
 may to your wishes pleasure bring
 i life would wish and that i might
 waste it for you like taperlight
 this antioch then antiochus the great
 built up this city for his chiefest seat
 the fairest in all syria
 i tell you what mine authors say
 this king unto him took a fere
 who died and left a female heir
 so buxom blithe and full of face
 as heaven had lent her all his grace
 with whom the father liking took
 and her to incest did provoke
 bad child worse father to entice his own
 to evil should be done by none
 but custom what they did begin
 was with long use account no sin
 the beauty of this sinful dame
 made many princes thither frame
 to seek her as a bedfellow
 in marriagepleasures playfellow
 which to prevent he made a law
 to keep her still and men in awe
 that whoso ask'd her for his wife
 his riddle told not lost his life
 so for her many a wight did die
 as yon grim looks do testify
 what now ensues to the judgment of your eye
 i give my cause who best can justify
 exit
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
scene i antioch a room in the palace
 enter antiochus prince pericles and followers
antiochus young prince of tyre you have at large received
 the danger of the task you undertake
pericles i have antiochus and with a soul
 embolden'd with the glory of her praise
 think death no hazard in this enterprise
antiochus bring in our daughter clothed like a bride
 for the embracements even of jove himself
 at whose conception till lucina reign'd
 nature this dowry gave to glad her presence
 the senatehouse of planets all did sit
 to knit in her their best perfections
 music enter the daughter of antiochus
pericles see where she comes apparell'd like the spring
 graces her subjects and her thoughts the king
 of every virtue gives renown to men
 her face the book of praises where is read
 nothing but curious pleasures as from thence
 sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
 could never be her mild companion
 you gods that made me man and sway in love
 that have inflamed desire in my breast
 to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree
 or die in the adventure be my helps
 as i am son and servant to your will
 to compass such a boundless happiness
antiochus prince pericles
pericles that would be son to great antiochus
antiochus before thee stands this fair hesperides
 with golden fruit but dangerous to be touch'd
 for deathlike dragons here affright thee hard
 her face like heaven enticeth thee to view
 her countless glory which desert must gain
 and which without desert because thine eye
 presumes to reach all thy whole heap must die
 yon sometimes famous princes like thyself
 drawn by report adventurous by desire
 tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale
 that without covering save yon field of stars
 here they stand martyrs slain in cupid's wars
 and with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
 for going on death's net whom none resist
pericles antiochus i thank thee who hath taught
 my frail mortality to know itself
 and by those fearful objects to prepare
 this body like to them to what i must
 for death remember'd should be like a mirror
 who tells us life's but breath to trust it error
 i'll make my will then and as sick men do
 who know the world see heaven but feeling woe
 gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did
 so i bequeath a happy peace to you
 and all good men as every prince should do
 my riches to the earth from whence they came
 but my unspotted fire of love to you
 to the daughter of antiochus
 thus ready for the way of life or death
 i wait the sharpest blow antiochus
antiochus scorning advice read the conclusion then
 which read and not expounded tis decreed
 as these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed
daughter of all say'd yet mayst thou prove prosperous
 of all say'd yet i wish thee happiness
pericles like a bold champion i assume the lists
 nor ask advice of any other thought
 but faithfulness and courage
 he reads the riddle
 i am no viper yet i feed
 on mother's flesh which did me breed
 i sought a husband in which labour
 i found that kindness in a father
 he's father son and husband mild
 i mother wife and yet his child
 how they may be and yet in two
 as you will live resolve it you
 sharp physic is the last but o you powers
 that give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts
 why cloud they not their sights perpetually
 if this be true which makes me pale to read it
 fair glass of light i loved you and could still
 takes hold of the hand of the daughter of antiochus
 were not this glorious casket stored with ill
 but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt
 for he's no man on whom perfections wait
 that knowing sin within will touch the gate
 you are a fair viol and your sense the strings
 who finger'd to make man his lawful music
 would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken
 but being play'd upon before your time
 hell only danceth at so harsh a chime
 good sooth i care not for you
antiochus prince pericles touch not upon thy life
 for that's an article within our law
 as dangerous as the rest your time's expired
 either expound now or receive your sentence
pericles great king
 few love to hear the sins they love to act
 twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it
 who has a book of all that monarchs do
 he's more secure to keep it shut than shown
 for vice repeated is like the wandering wind
 blows dust in other's eyes to spread itself
 and yet the end of all is bought thus dear
 the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear
 to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts
 copp'd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throng'd
 by man's oppression and the poor worm doth die for't
 kings are earth's gods in vice their law's
 their will
 and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill
 it is enough you know and it is fit
 what being more known grows worse to smother it
 all love the womb that their first being bred
 then give my tongue like leave to love my head
antiochus aside heaven that i had thy head he has found
 the meaning
 but i will gloze with himyoung prince of tyre
 though by the tenor of our strict edict
 your exposition misinterpreting
 we might proceed to cancel of your days
 yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree
 as your fair self doth tune us otherwise
 forty days longer we do respite you
 if by which time our secret be undone
 this mercy shows we'll joy in such a son
 and until then your entertain shall be
 as doth befit our honour and your worth
 exeunt all but pericles
pericles how courtesy would seem to cover sin
 when what is done is like an hypocrite
 the which is good in nothing but in sight
 if it be true that i interpret false
 then were it certain you were not so bad
 as with foul incest to abuse your soul
 where now you're both a father and a son
 by your untimely claspings with your child
 which pleasure fits an husband not a father
 and she an eater of her mother's flesh
 by the defiling of her parent's bed
 and both like serpents are who though they feed
 on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed
 antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men
 blush not in actions blacker than the night
 will shun no course to keep them from the light
 one sin i know another doth provoke
 murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke
 poison and treason are the hands of sin
 ay and the targets to put off the shame
 then lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear
 by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear
 exit
 reenter antiochus
antiochus he hath found the meaning for which we mean
 to have his head
 he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy
 nor tell the world antiochus doth sin
 in such a loathed manner
 and therefore instantly this prince must die
 for by his fall my honour must keep high
 who attends us there
 enter thaliard
thaliard doth your highness call
antiochus thaliard
 you are of our chamber and our mind partakes
 her private actions to your secrecy
 and for your faithfulness we will advance you
 thaliard behold here's poison and here's gold
 we hate the prince of tyre and thou must kill him
 it fits thee not to ask the reason why
 because we bid it say is it done
thaliard my lord
 tis done
antiochus enough
 enter a messenger
 let your breath cool yourself telling your haste
messenger my lord prince pericles is fled
 exit
antiochus as thou
 wilt live fly after and like an arrow shot
 from a wellexperienced archer hits the mark
 his eye doth level at so thou ne'er return
 unless thou say prince pericles is dead'
thaliard my lord
 if i can get him within my pistol's length
 i'll make him sure enough so farewell to your highness
antiochus thaliard adieu
 exit thaliard
 till pericles be dead
 my heart can lend no succor to my head
 exit
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
scene ii tyre a room in the palace
 enter pericles
pericles to lords without let none disturb uswhy should
 this change of thoughts
 the sad companion dulleyed melancholy
 be my so used a guest as not an hour
 in the day's glorious walk or peaceful night
 the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet
 here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them
 and danger which i fear'd is at antioch
 whose aim seems far too short to hit me here
 yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits
 nor yet the other's distance comfort me
 then it is thus the passions of the mind
 that have their first conception by misdread
 have afternourishment and life by care
 and what was first but fear what might be done
 grows elder now and cares it be not done
 and so with me the great antiochus
 gainst whom i am too little to contend
 since he's so great can make his will his act
 will think me speaking though i swear to silence
 nor boots it me to say i honour him
 if he suspect i may dishonour him
 and what may make him blush in being known
 he'll stop the course by which it might be known
 with hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land
 and with the ostent of war will look so huge
 amazement shall drive courage from the state
 our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist
 and subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence
 which care of them not pity of myself
 who am no more but as the tops of trees
 which fence the roots they grow by and defend them
 makes both my body pine and soul to languish
 and punish that before that he would punish
 enter helicanus with other lords
first lord joy and all comfort in your sacred breast
second lord and keep your mind till you return to us
 peaceful and comfortable
helicanus peace peace and give experience tongue
 they do abuse the king that flatter him
 for flattery is the bellows blows up sin
 the thing which is flatter'd but a spark
 to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing
 whereas reproof obedient and in order
 fits kings as they are men for they may err
 when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace
 he flatters you makes war upon your life
 prince pardon me or strike me if you please
 i cannot be much lower than my knees
pericles all leave us else but let your cares o'erlook
 what shipping and what lading's in our haven
 and then return to us
 exeunt lords
 helicanus thou
 hast moved us what seest thou in our looks
helicanus an angry brow dread lord
pericles if there be such a dart in princes frowns
 how durst thy tongue move anger to our face
helicanus how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence
 they have their nourishment
pericles thou know'st i have power
 to take thy life from thee
helicanus kneeling
 i have ground the axe myself
 do you but strike the blow
pericles rise prithee rise
 sit down thou art no flatterer
 i thank thee for it and heaven forbid
 that kings should let their ears hear their
 faults hid
 fit counsellor and servant for a prince
 who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant
 what wouldst thou have me do
helicanus to bear with patience
 such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself
pericles thou speak'st like a physician helicanus
 that minister'st a potion unto me
 that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself
 attend me then i went to antioch
 where as thou know'st against the face of death
 i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty
 from whence an issue i might propagate
 are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects
 her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder
 the resthark in thine earas black as incest
 which by my knowledge found the sinful father
 seem'd not to strike but smooth but thou
 know'st this
 tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss
 such fear so grew in me i hither fled
 under the covering of a careful night
 who seem'd my good protector and being here
 bethought me what was past what might succeed
 i knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears
 decrease not but grow faster than the years
 and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth
 that i should open to the listening air
 how many worthy princes bloods were shed
 to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope
 to lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms
 and make pretence of wrong that i have done him
 when all for mine if i may call offence
 must feel war's blow who spares not innocence
 which love to all of which thyself art one
 who now reprovest me for it
helicanus alas sir
pericles drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks
 musings into my mind with thousand doubts
 how i might stop this tempest ere it came
 and finding little comfort to relieve them
 i thought it princely charity to grieve them
helicanus well my lord since you have given me leave to speak
 freely will i speak antiochus you fear
 and justly too i think you fear the tyrant
 who either by public war or private treason
 will take away your life
 therefore my lord go travel for a while
 till that his rage and anger be forgot
 or till the destinies do cut his thread of life
 your rule direct to any if to me
 day serves not light more faithful than i'll be
pericles i do not doubt thy faith
 but should he wrong my liberties in my absence
helicanus we'll mingle our bloods together in the earth
 from whence we had our being and our birth
pericles tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus
 intend my travel where i'll hear from thee
 and by whose letters i'll dispose myself
 the care i had and have of subjects good
 on thee i lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it
 i'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath
 who shuns not to break one will sure crack both
 but in our orbs we'll live so round and safe
 that time of both this truth shall ne'er convince
 thou show'dst a subject's shine i a true prince

thaliard so this is tyre and this the court here must i
 kill king pericles and if i do it not i am sure to
 be hanged at home tis dangerous well i perceive
 he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that
 being bid to ask what he would of the king desired
 he might know none of his secrets now do i see he
 had some reason for't for if a king bid a man be a
 villain he's bound by the indenture of his oath to
 be one hush here come the lords of tyre
 enter helicanus and escanes with other lords of tyre
helicanus you shall not need my fellow peers of tyre
 further to question me of your king's departure
 his seal'd commission left in trust with me
 doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel
thaliard aside how the king gone
helicanus if further yet you will be satisfied
 why as it were unlicensed of your loves
 he would depart i'll give some light unto you
 being at antioch
thaliard aside what from antioch
helicanus royal antiochuson what cause i know not
 took some displeasure at him at least he judged so
 and doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd
 to show his sorrow he'ld correct himself
 so puts himself unto the shipman's toil
 with whom each minute threatens life or death
thaliard aside well i perceive
 i shall not be hang'd now although i would
 but since he's gone the king's seas must please
 he scaped the land to perish at the sea
 i'll present myself peace to the lords of tyre
helicanus lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome
thaliard from him i come
 with message unto princely pericles
 but since my landing i have understood
 your lord has betook himself to unknown travels
 my message must return from whence it came
helicanus we have no reason to desire it
 commended to our master not to us
 yet ere you shall depart this we desire
 as friends to antioch we may feast in tyre

scene iv tarsus a room in the governor's house
 enter cleon the governor of tarsus with dionyza
 and others
cleon my dionyza shall we rest us here
 and by relating tales of others griefs
 see if twill teach us to forget our own
dionyza that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it
 for who digs hills because they do aspire
 throws down one mountain to cast up a higher
 o my distressed lord even such our griefs are
 here they're but felt and seen with mischief's eyes
 but like to groves being topp'd they higher rise
cleon o dionyza
 who wanteth food and will not say he wants it
 or can conceal his hunger till he famish
 our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
 our woes into the air our eyes do weep
 till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder
 that if heaven slumber while their creatures want
 they may awake their helps to comfort them
 i'll then discourse our woes felt several years
 and wanting breath to speak help me with tears
dionyza i'll do my best sir
cleon this tarsus o'er which i have the government
 a city on whom plenty held full hand
 for riches strew'd herself even in the streets
 whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds
 and strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at
 whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd
 like one another's glass to trim them by
 their tables were stored full to glad the sight
 and not so much to feed on as delight
 all poverty was scorn'd and pride so great
 the name of help grew odious to repeat
dionyza o tis too true
cleon but see what heaven can do by this our change
 these mouths who but of late earth sea and air
 were all too little to content and please
 although they gave their creatures in abundance
 as houses are defiled for want of use
 they are now starved for want of exercise
 those palates who not yet two summers younger
 must have inventions to delight the taste
 would now be glad of bread and beg for it
 those mothers who to nousle up their babes
 thought nought too curious are ready now
 to eat those little darlings whom they loved
 so sharp are hunger's teeth that man and wife
 draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life
 here stands a lord and there a lady weeping
 here many sink yet those which see them fall
 have scarce strength left to give them burial
 is not this true
dionyza our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it
cleon o let those cities that of plenty's cup
 and her prosperities so largely taste
 with their superfluous riots hear these tears
 the misery of tarsus may be theirs
 enter a lord
lord where's the lord governor
cleon here
 speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste
 for comfort is too far for us to expect
lord we have descried upon our neighbouring shore
 a portly sail of ships make hitherward
cleon i thought as much
 one sorrow never comes but brings an heir
 that may succeed as his inheritor
 and so in ours some neighbouring nation
 taking advantage of our misery
 hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power
 to beat us down the which are down already
 and make a conquest of unhappy me
 whereas no glory's got to overcome
lord that's the least fear for by the semblance
 of their white flags display'd they bring us peace
 and come to us as favourers not as foes
cleon thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat
 who makes the fairest show means most deceit
 but bring they what they will and what they can
 what need we fear
 the ground's the lowest and we are half way there
 go tell their general we attend him here
 to know for what he comes and whence he comes
 and what he craves
lord i go my lord
 exit
cleon welcome is peace if he on peace consist
 if wars we are unable to resist
 enter pericles with attendants
pericles lord governor for so we hear you are
 let not our ships and number of our men
 be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes
 we have heard your miseries as far as tyre
 and seen the desolation of your streets
 nor come we to add sorrow to your tears
 but to relieve them of their heavy load
 and these our ships you happily may think
 are like the trojan horse was stuff'd within
 with bloody veins expecting overthrow
 are stored with corn to make your needy bread
 and give them life whom hunger starved half dead
all the gods of greece protect you
 and we'll pray for you
pericles arise i pray you rise
 we do not look for reverence but to love
 and harbourage for ourself our ships and men
cleon the which when any shall not gratify
 or pay you with unthankfulness in thought
 be it our wives our children or ourselves
 the curse of heaven and men succeed their evils
 till whenthe which i hope shall ne'er be seen
 your grace is welcome to our town and us

 is but a substance that must yield to you
 and i as fits my nature do obey you
 alas the sea hath cast me on the rocks
 wash'd me from shore to shore and left me breath
 nothing to think on but ensuing death

second fisherman ha come and bring away the nets
first fisherman what patchbreech i say
third fisherman what say you master
first fisherman look how thou stirrest now come away or i'll
 fetch thee with a wanion
third fisherman faith master i am thinking of the poor men that
 were cast away before us even now
first fisherman alas poor souls it grieved my heart to hear what
 pitiful cries they made to us to help them when
 welladay we could scarce help ourselves
third fisherman nay master said not i as much when i saw the
 porpus how he bounced and tumbled they say
 they're half fish half flesh a plague on them
 they ne'er come but i look to be washed master i
 marvel how the fishes live in the sea
first fisherman why as men do aland the great ones eat up the
 little ones i can compare our rich misers to
 nothing so fitly as to a whale a plays and
 tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at
 last devours them all at a mouthful such whales
 have i heard on o the land who never leave gaping
 till they've swallowed the whole parish church
 steeple bells and all
pericles aside a pretty moral
third fisherman but master if i had been the sexton i would have
 been that day in the belfry
second fisherman why man
third fisherman because he should have swallowed me too and when i
 had been in his belly i would have kept such a
 jangling of the bells that he should never have
 left till he cast bells steeple church and
 parish up again but if the good king simonides
 were of my mind
pericles aside simonides
third fisherman we would purge the land of these drones that rob
 the bee of her honey
pericles aside how from the finny subject of the sea
 these fishers tell the infirmities of men
 and from their watery empire recollect
 all that may men approve or men detect
 peace be at your labour honest fishermen
second fisherman honest good fellow what's that if it be a day
 fits you search out of the calendar and nobody
 look after it
pericles may see the sea hath cast upon your coast
second fisherman what a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
 way
pericles a man whom both the waters and the wind
 in that vast tenniscourt have made the ball
 for them to play upon entreats you pity him
 he asks of you that never used to beg
first fisherman no friend cannot you beg here's them in our
 country greece gets more with begging than we can do
 with working
second fisherman canst thou catch any fishes then
pericles i never practised it
second fisherman nay then thou wilt starve sure for here's nothing
 to be got nowadays unless thou canst fish for't
pericles what i have been i have forgot to know
 but what i am want teaches me to think on
 a man throng'd up with cold my veins are chill
 and have no more of life than may suffice
 to give my tongue that heat to ask your help
 which if you shall refuse when i am dead
 for that i am a man pray see me buried
first fisherman die quotha now gods forbid i have a gown here
 come put it on keep thee warm now afore me a
 handsome fellow come thou shalt go home and
 we'll have flesh for holidays fish for
 fastingdays and moreo'er puddings and flapjacks
 and thou shalt be welcome
pericles i thank you sir
second fisherman hark you my friend you said you could not beg
pericles i did but crave
second fisherman but crave then i'll turn craver too and so i
 shall scape whipping
pericles why are all your beggars whipped then
second fisherman o not all my friend not all for if all your
 beggars were whipped i would wish no better office
 than to be beadle but master i'll go draw up the
 net
 exit with third fisherman
pericles aside how well this honest mirth becomes their labour
first fisherman hark you sir do you know where ye are
pericles not well
first fisherman why i'll tell you this is called pentapolis and
 our king the good simonides
pericles the good king simonides do you call him
first fisherman ay sir and he deserves so to be called for his
 peaceable reign and good government
pericles he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects
 the name of good by his government how far is his
 court distant from this shore
first fisherman marry sir half a day's journey and i'll tell
 you he hath a fair daughter and tomorrow is her
 birthday and there are princes and knights come
 from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love
pericles were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish
 to make one there
first fisherman o sir things must be as they may and what a man
 cannot get he may lawfully deal forhis wife's soul
 reenter second and third fishermen drawing up a net
second fisherman help master help here's a fish hangs in the net
 like a poor man's right in the law twill hardly
 come out ha bots on't tis come at last and
 tis turned to a rusty armour
pericles an armour friends i pray you let me see it
 thanks fortune yet that after all my crosses
 thou givest me somewhat to repair myself
 and though it was mine own part of my heritage
 which my dead father did bequeath to me
 with this strict charge even as he left his life
 keep it my pericles it hath been a shield
 twixt me and death'and pointed to this brace
 for that it saved me keep it in like necessity
 the which the gods protect thee frommay
 defend thee'
 it kept where i kept i so dearly loved it
 till the rough seas that spare not any man
 took it in rage though calm'd have given't again
 i thank thee for't my shipwreck now's no ill
 since i have here my father's gift in's will
first fisherman what mean you sir
pericles to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth
 for it was sometime target to a king
 i know it by this mark he loved me dearly
 and for his sake i wish the having of it
 and that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court
 where with it i may appear a gentleman
 and if that ever my low fortune's better
 i'll pay your bounties till then rest your debtor
first fisherman why wilt thou tourney for the lady
pericles i'll show the virtue i have borne in arms
first fisherman why do e take it and the gods give thee good on't
second fisherman ay but hark you my friend twas we that made up
 this garment through the rough seams of the waters
 there are certain condolements certain vails i
 hope sir if you thrive you'll remember from
 whence you had it
pericles believe t i will
 by your furtherance i am clothed in steel
 and spite of all the rapture of the sea
 this jewel holds his building on my arm
 unto thy value i will mount myself
 upon a courser whose delightful steps
 shall make the gazer joy to see him tread
 only my friend i yet am unprovided
 of a pair of bases
second fisherman we'll sure provide thou shalt have my best gown to
 make thee a pair and i'll bring thee to the court myself

 in honour of whose birth these triumphs are
 sits here like beauty's child whom nature gat
 for men to see and seeing wonder at
 exit a lord
thaisa it pleaseth you my royal father to express
 my commendations great whose merit's less
simonides it's fit it should be so for princes are
 a model which heaven makes like to itself
 as jewels lose their glory if neglected
 so princes their renowns if not respected
 tis now your honour daughter to explain
 the labour of each knight in his device
thaisa which to preserve mine honour i'll perform
 enter a knight he passes over and his squire
 presents his shield to the princess
simonides who is the first that doth prefer himself
thaisa a knight of sparta my renowned father
 and the device he bears upon his shield
 is a black ethiope reaching at the sun
 the word lux tua vita mihi'
simonides he loves you well that holds his life of you
 the second knight passes over
 who is the second that presents himself
thaisa a prince of macedon my royal father
 and the device he bears upon his shield
 is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady
 the motto thus in spanish piu por dulzura que por fuerza'
 the third knight passes over
simonides and what's the third
thaisa the third of antioch
 and his device a wreath of chivalry
 the word me pompae provexit apex'
 the fourth knight passes over
simonides what is the fourth
thaisa a burning torch that's turned upside down
 the word quod me alit me extinguit'
simonides which shows that beauty hath his power and will
 which can as well inflame as it can kill
 the fifth knight passes over
thaisa the fifth an hand environed with clouds
 holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried
 the motto thus sic spectanda fides'
 the sixth knight pericles passes over
simonides and what's
 the sixth and last the which the knight himself
 with such a graceful courtesy deliver'd
thaisa he seems to be a stranger but his present is
 a wither'd branch that's only green at top
 the motto in hac spe vivo'
simonides a pretty moral
 from the dejected state wherein he is
 he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish
first lord he had need mean better than his outward show
 can any way speak in his just commend
 for by his rusty outside he appears
 to have practised more the whipstock than the lance
second lord he well may be a stranger for he comes
 to an honour'd triumph strangely furnished
third lord and on set purpose let his armour rust
 until this day to scour it in the dust
simonides opinion's but a fool that makes us scan
 the outward habit by the inward man

 to say you're welcome were superfluous
 to place upon the volume of your deeds
 as in a titlepage your worth in arms
 were more than you expect or more than's fit
 since every worth in show commends itself
 prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast
 you are princes and my guests
thaisa but you my knight and guest
 to whom this wreath of victory i give
 and crown you king of this day's happiness
pericles tis more by fortune lady than by merit
simonides call it by what you will the day is yours
 and here i hope is none that envies it
 in framing an artist art hath thus decreed
 to make some good but others to exceed
 and you are her labour'd scholar come queen o'
 the feast
 for daughter so you arehere take your place
 marshal the rest as they deserve their grace
knights we are honour'd much by good simonides
simonides your presence glads our days honour we love
 for who hates honour hates the gods above
marshal sir yonder is your place
pericles some other is more fit
first knight contend not sir for we are gentlemen
 that neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
 envy the great nor do the low despise
pericles you are right courteous knights
simonides sit sir sit
pericles by jove i wonder that is king of thoughts
 these cates resist me she but thought upon
thaisa by juno that is queen of marriage
 all viands that i eat do seem unsavoury
 wishing him my meat sure he's a gallant gentleman
simonides he's but a country gentleman
 has done no more than other knights have done
 has broken a staff or so so let it pass
thaisa to me he seems like diamond to glass
pericles yon king's to me like to my father's picture
 which tells me in that glory once he was
 had princes sit like stars about his throne
 and he the sun for them to reverence
 none that beheld him but like lesser lights
 did vail their crowns to his supremacy
 where now his son's like a glowworm in the night
 the which hath fire in darkness none in light
 whereby i see that time's the king of men
 he's both their parent and he is their grave
 and gives them what he will not what they crave
simonides what are you merry knights
knights who can be other in this royal presence
simonides here with a cup that's stored unto the brim
 as you do love fill to your mistress lips
 we drink this health to you
knights we thank your grace
simonides yet pause awhile
 yon knight doth sit too melancholy
 as if the entertainment in our court
 had not a show might countervail his worth
 note it not you thaisa
thaisa what is it
 to me my father
simonides o attend my daughter
 princes in this should live like gods above
 who freely give to every one that comes
 to honour them
 and princes not doing so are like to gnats
 which make a sound but kill'd are wonder'd at
 therefore to make his entrance more sweet
 here say we drink this standingbowl of wine to him
thaisa alas my father it befits not me
 unto a stranger knight to be so bold
 he may my proffer take for an offence
 since men take women's gifts for impudence
simonides how
 do as i bid you or you'll move me else
thaisa aside now by the gods he could not please me better
simonides and furthermore tell him we desire to know of him
 of whence he is his name and parentage
thaisa the king my father sir has drunk to you
pericles i thank him
thaisa wishing it so much blood unto your life
pericles i thank both him and you and pledge him freely
thaisa and further he desires to know of you
 of whence you are your name and parentage
pericles a gentleman of tyre my name pericles
 my education been in arts and arms
 who looking for adventures in the world
 was by the rough seas reft of ships and men
 and after shipwreck driven upon this shore
thaisa he thanks your grace names himself pericles
 a gentleman of tyre
 who only by misfortune of the seas
 bereft of ships and men cast on this shore
simonides now by the gods i pity his misfortune
 and will awake him from his melancholy
 come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles
 and waste the time which looks for other revels
 even in your armours as you are address'd
 will very well become a soldier's dance
 i will not have excuse with saying this
 loud music is too harsh for ladies heads
 since they love men in arms as well as beds
 the knights dance
 so this was well ask'd'twas so well perform'd
 come sir
 here is a lady that wants breathing too
 and i have heard you knights of tyre
 are excellent in making ladies trip
 and that their measures are as excellent
pericles in those that practise them they are my lord
simonides o that's as much as you would be denied
 of your fair courtesy
 the knights and ladies dance
 unclasp unclasp
 thanks gentlemen to all all have done well
 to pericles
 but you the best pages and lights to conduct
 these knights unto their several lodgings
 to pericles
 yours sir
 we have given order to be next our own
pericles i am at your grace's pleasure

 but if the prince do live let us salute him
 or know what ground's made happy by his breath
 if in the world he live we'll seek him out
 if in his grave he rest we'll find him there
 and be resolved he lives to govern us
 or dead give's cause to mourn his funeral
 and leave us to our free election

 take i your wish i leap into the seas
 where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease
 a twelvemonth longer let me entreat you to
 forbear the absence of your king
 if in which time expired he not return
 i shall with aged patience bear your yoke
 but if i cannot win you to this love
 go search like nobles like noble subjects
 and in your search spend your adventurous worth
 whom if you find and win unto return
 you shall like diamonds sit about his crown

pericles the worst of all her scholars my good lord
simonides let me ask you one thing
 what do you think of my daughter sir
pericles a most virtuous princess
simonides and she is fair too is she not
pericles as a fair day in summer wondrous fair
simonides sir my daughter thinks very well of you
 ay so well that you must be her master
 and she will be your scholar therefore look to it
pericles i am unworthy for her schoolmaster
simonides she thinks not so peruse this writing else
pericles aside what's here
 a letter that she loves the knight of tyre
 tis the king's subtlety to have my life
 o seek not to entrap me gracious lord
 a stranger and distressed gentleman
 that never aim'd so high to love your daughter
 but bent all offices to honour her
simonides thou hast bewitch'd my daughter and thou art
 a villain
pericles by the gods i have not
 never did thought of mine levy offence
 nor never did my actions yet commence
 a deed might gain her love or your displeasure
simonides traitor thou liest
pericles traitor
simonides ay traitor
pericles even in his throatunless it be the king
 that calls me traitor i return the lie
simonides aside now by the gods i do applaud his courage
pericles my actions are as noble as my thoughts
 that never relish'd of a base descent
 i came unto your court for honour's cause
 and not to be a rebel to her state
 and he that otherwise accounts of me
 this sword shall prove he's honour's enemy
simonides no
 here comes my daughter she can witness it
 enter thaisa
pericles then as you are as virtuous as fair
 resolve your angry father if my tongue
 did ere solicit or my hand subscribe
 to any syllable that made love to you
thaisa why sir say if you had
 who takes offence at that would make me glad
simonides yea mistress are you so peremptory
 aside
 i am glad on't with all my heart
 i'll tame you i'll bring you in subjection
 will you not having my consent
 bestow your love and your affections
 upon a stranger
 aside
 who for aught i know
 may be nor can i think the contrary
 as great in blood as i myself
 therefore hear you mistress either frame
 your will to mineand you sir hear you
 either be ruled by me or i will make you
 man and wife
 nay come your hands and lips must seal it too
 and being join'd i'll thus your hopes destroy
 and for a further griefgod give you joy
 what are you both pleased
thaisa yes if you love me sir
pericles even as my life or blood that fosters it
simonides what are you both agreed
both yes if it please your majesty
simonides it pleaseth me so well that i will see you wed
 and then with what haste you can get you to bed

 of helicanus would set on
 the crown of tyre but he will none

cerimon gentlemen
 why do you stir so early
first gentleman sir
 our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea
 shook as the earth did quake
 the very principals did seem to rend
 and allto topple pure surprise and fear
 made me to quit the house
second gentleman that is the cause we trouble you so early
 tis not our husbandry
cerimon o you say well
first gentleman but i much marvel that your lordship having
 rich tire about you should at these early hours
 shake off the golden slumber of repose
 tis most strange
 nature should be so conversant with pain
 being thereto not compell'd
cerimon i hold it ever
 virtue and cunning were endowments greater
 than nobleness and riches careless heirs
 may the two latter darken and expend
 but immortality attends the former
 making a man a god tis known i ever
 have studied physic through which secret art
 by turning o'er authorities i have
 together with my practise made familiar
 to me and to my aid the blest infusions
 that dwell in vegetives in metals stones
 and i can speak of the disturbances
 that nature works and of her cures which doth give me
 a more content in course of true delight
 than to be thirsty after tottering honour
 or tie my treasure up in silken bags
 to please the fool and death
second gentleman your honour has through ephesus pour'd forth
 your charity and hundreds call themselves
 your creatures who by you have been restored
 and not your knowledge your personal pain but even
 your purse still open hath built lord cerimon
 such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay

cerimon set t down let's look upon't
second gentleman tis like a coffin sir
cerimon whate'er it be
 tis wondrous heavy wrench it open straight
 if the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold
 tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us
second gentleman tis so my lord
cerimon how close tis caulk'd and bitumed
 did the sea cast it up
first servant i never saw so huge a billow sir
 as toss'd it upon shore
cerimon wrench it open
 soft it smells most sweetly in my sense
second gentleman a delicate odour
cerimon as ever hit my nostril so up with it
 o you most potent gods what's here a corse
first gentleman most strange
cerimon shrouded in cloth of state balm'd and entreasured
 with full bags of spices a passport too
 apollo perfect me in the characters
 reads from a scroll
 here i give to understand
 if e'er this coffin drive aland
 i king pericles have lost
 this queen worth all our mundane cost
 who finds her give her burying
 she was the daughter of a king
 besides this treasure for a fee
 the gods requite his charity'
 if thou livest pericles thou hast a heart
 that even cracks for woe this chanced tonight
second gentleman most likely sir
cerimon nay certainly tonight
 for look how fresh she looks they were too rough
 that threw her in the sea make a fire within
 fetch hither all my boxes in my closet

 death may usurp on nature many hours
 and yet the fire of life kindle again

 this queen will live nature awakes a warmth
 breathes out of her she hath not been entranced
 above five hours see how she gins to blow
 into life's flower again

 through you increase our wonder and set up
 your fame forever
cerimon she is alive behold
 her eyelids cases to those heavenly jewels
 which pericles hath lost
 begin to part their fringes of bright gold
 the diamonds of a most praised water
 do appear to make the world twice rich live
 and make us weep to hear your fate fair creature
 rare as you seem to be
 she moves

 must be as tis my gentle babe marina whom
 for she was born at sea i have named so here
 i charge your charity withal leaving her
 the infant of your care beseeching you
 to give her princely training that she may be
 manner'd as she is born
cleon fear not my lord but think
 your grace that fed my country with your corn
 for which the people's prayers still fall upon you
 must in your child be thought on if neglection
 should therein make me vile the common body
 by you relieved would force me to my duty
 but if to that my nature need a spur
 the gods revenge it upon me and mine
 to the end of generation
pericles i believe you
 your honour and your goodness teach me to't
 without your vows till she be married madam
 by bright diana whom we honour all
 unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain

 good madam make me blessed in your care
 in bringing up my child
dionyza i have one myself
 who shall not be more dear to my respect
 than yours my lord
pericles madam my thanks and prayers
cleon we'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o the shore
 then give you up to the mask'd neptune and

 in music letters who hath gain'd
 of education all the grace
 which makes her both the heart and place
 of general wonder but alack
 that monster envy oft the wrack
 of earned praise marina's life
 seeks to take off by treason's knife
 and in this kind hath our cleon
 one daughter and a wench full grown
 even ripe for marriagerite this maid
 hight philoten and it is said
 for certain in our story she
 would ever with marina be
 be't when she weaved the sleided silk
 with fingers long small white as milk
 or when she would with sharp needle wound
 the cambric which she made more sound
 by hurting it or when to the lute
 she sung and made the nightbird mute
 that still records with moan or when
 she would with rich and constant pen
 vail to her mistress dian still
 this philoten contends in skill
 with absolute marina so
 with the dove of paphos might the crow
 vie feathers white marina gets
 all praises which are paid as debts
 and not as given this so darks
 in philoten all graceful marks
 that cleon's wife with envy rare
 a present murderer does prepare
 for good marina that her daughter
 might stand peerless by this slaughter
 the sooner her vile thoughts to stead
 lychorida our nurse is dead

 no care to your best courses go i pray you
 walk and be cheerful once again reserve

leonine come say your prayers
marina what mean you
leonine if you require a little space for prayer
 i grant it pray but be not tedious
 for the gods are quick of ear and i am sworn

leonine to satisfy my lady
marina why would she have me kill'd
 now as i can remember by my troth
 i never did her hurt in all my life
 i never spake bad word nor did ill turn
 to any living creature believe me la
 i never kill'd a mouse nor hurt a fly
 i trod upon a worm against my will
 but i wept for it how have i offended
 wherein my death might yield her any profit
 or my life imply her any danger
leonine my commission
 is not to reason of the deed but do it
marina you will not do't for all the world i hope

 come in our shadow to scatter his crowns in the
 sun

 should lodge them with this sign
bawd to marina pray you come hither awhile you
 have fortunes coming upon you mark me you must
 seem to do that fearfully which you commit
 willingly despise profit where you have most gain
 to weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
 lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good
 opinion and that opinion a mere profit
marina i understand you not
boult o take her home mistress take her home these
 blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise

 bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go

 the sun and moon ne'er look'd upon
dionyza i think
 you'll turn a child again
cleon were i chief lord of all this spacious world
 i'ld give it to undo the deed o lady
 much less in blood than virtue yet a princess
 to equal any single crown o the earth
 i the justice of compare o villain leonine
 whom thou hast poison'd too
 if thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness
 becoming well thy fact what canst thou say
 when noble pericles shall demand his child
dionyza that she is dead nurses are not the fates
 to foster it nor ever to preserve
 she died at night i'll say so who can cross it
 unless you play the pious innocent
 and for an honest attribute cry out
 she died by foul play'
cleon o go to well well
 of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods
 do like this worst
dionyza be one of those that think
 the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence
 and open this to pericles i do shame
 to think of what a noble strain you are
 and of how coward a spirit
cleon to such proceeding
 who ever but his approbation added
 though not his prime consent he did not flow
 from honourable sources
dionyza be it so then
 yet none does know but you how she came dead
 nor none can know leonine being gone
 she did disdain my child and stood between
 her and her fortunes none would look on her
 but cast their gazes on marina's face
 whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
 not worth the time of day it pierced me through
 and though you call my course unnatural
 you not your child well loving yet i find
 it greets me as an enterprise of kindness
 perform'd to your sole daughter
cleon heavens forgive it
dionyza and as for pericles
 what should he say we wept after her hearse
 and yet we mourn her monument
 is almost finish'd and her epitaphs
 in glittering golden characters express
 a general praise to her and care in us
 at whose expense tis done
cleon thou art like the harpy
 which to betray dost with thine angel's face
 seize with thine eagle's talons
dionyza you are like one that superstitiously
 doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies
 but yet i know you'll do as i advise

gower thus time we waste and longest leagues make short
 sail seas in cockles have an wish but for't
 making to take your imagination
 from bourn to bourn region to region
 by you being pardon'd we commit no crime
 to use one language in each several clime
 where our scenes seem to live i do beseech you
 to learn of me who stand i the gaps to teach you
 the stages of our story pericles
 is now again thwarting the wayward seas
 attended on by many a lord and knight
 to see his daughter all his life's delight
 old escanes whom helicanus late
 advanced in time to great and high estate
 is left to govern bear you it in mind
 old helicanus goes along behind
 wellsailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
 this king to tarsusthink his pilot thought
 so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on
 to fetch his daughter home who first is gone
 like motes and shadows see them move awhile
 your ears unto your eyes i'll reconcile
 dumb show
 enter pericles at one door with all his train
 cleon and dionyza at the other cleon shows
 pericles the tomb whereat pericles makes
 lamentation puts on sackcloth and in a mighty
 passion departs then exeunt cleon and dionyza
 see how belief may suffer by foul show
 this borrow'd passion stands for true old woe
 and pericles in sorrow all devour'd
 with sighs shot through and biggest tears
 o'ershower'd
 leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears
 never to wash his face nor cut his hairs
 he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears
 a tempest which his mortal vessel tears
 and yet he rides it out now please you wit
 the epitaph is for marina writ
 by wicked dionyza
 reads the inscription on marina's monument
 the fairest sweet'st and best lies here
 who wither'd in her spring of year
 she was of tyrus the king's daughter
 on whom foul death hath made this slaughter
 marina was she call'd and at her birth
 thetis being proud swallow'd some part o the earth
 therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflow'd
 hath thetis birthchild on the heavens bestow'd
 wherefore she does and swears she'll never stint
 make raging battery upon shores of flint'
 no visor does become black villany
 so well as soft and tender flattery
 let pericles believe his daughter's dead
 and bear his courses to be ordered
 by lady fortune while our scene must play
 his daughter's woe and heavy welladay
 in her unholy service patience then

 that am a maid though most ungentle fortune
 have placed me in this sty where since i came
 diseases have been sold dearer than physic
 o that the gods
 would set me free from this unhallow'd place
 though they did change me to the meanest bird
 that flies i the purer air
lysimachus i did not think
 thou couldst have spoke so well ne'er dream'd thou couldst
 had i brought hither a corrupted mind
 thy speech had alter'd it hold here's gold for thee
 persever in that clear way thou goest
 and the gods strengthen thee
marina the good gods preserve you

 fare thee well thou art a piece of virtue and

 nobleman and she sent him away as cold as a
 snowball saying his prayers too

marina prithee tell me one thing first
boult come now your one thing
marina what canst thou wish thine enemy to be
boult why i could wish him to be my master or rather my mistress
marina neither of these are so bad as thou art
 since they do better thee in their command
 thou hold'st a place for which the pained'st fiend
 of hell would not in reputation change
 thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
 coistrel that comes inquiring for his tib
 to the choleric fisting of every rogue
 thy ear is liable thy food is such
 as hath been belch'd on by infected lungs
boult what would you have me do go to the wars would
 you where a man may serve seven years for the loss
 of a leg and have not money enough in the end to
 buy him a wooden one
marina do any thing but this thou doest empty
 old receptacles or common shores of filth
 serve by indenture to the common hangman
 any of these ways are yet better than this
 for what thou professest a baboon could he speak
 would own a name too dear o that the gods
 would safely deliver me from this place
 here here's gold for thee
 if that thy master would gain by thee
 proclaim that i can sing weave sew and dance
 with other virtues which i'll keep from boast
 and i will undertake all these to teach
 i doubt not but this populous city will
 yield many scholars
boult but can you teach all this you speak of
marina prove that i cannot take me home again
 and prostitute me to the basest groom
 that doth frequent your house
boult well i will see what i can do for thee if i can
 place thee i will
marina but amongst honest women
boult faith my acquaintance lies little amongst them
 but since my master and mistress have bought you
 there's no going but by their consent therefore i
 will make them acquainted with your purpose and i
 doubt not but i shall find them tractable enough
 come i'll do for thee what i can come your ways

 pavilion on deck with a curtain before it pericles
 within it reclined on a couch a barge lying
 beside the tyrian vessel
 enter two sailors one belonging to the tyrian
 vessel the other to the barge to them helicanus
tyrian sailor to the sailor of mytilene where is lord helicanus
 he can resolve you
 o here he is
 sir there's a barge put off from mytilene
 and in it is lysimachus the governor
 who craves to come aboard what is your will
helicanus that he have his call up some gentlemen
tyrian sailor ho gentlemen my lord calls
 enter two or three gentlemen
first gentleman doth your lordship call
helicanus gentlemen there's some of worth would come aboard
 i pray ye greet them fairly
 the gentlemen and the two sailors descend and go
 on board the barge
 enter from thence lysimachus and lords with the
 gentlemen and the two sailors
tyrian sailor sir
 this is the man that can in aught you would
 resolve you
lysimachus hail reverend sir the gods preserve you
helicanus and you sir to outlive the age i am
 and die as i would do
lysimachus you wish me well
 being on shore honouring of neptune's triumphs
 seeing this goodly vessel ride before us
 i made to it to know of whence you are
helicanus first what is your place
lysimachus i am the governor of this place you lie before
helicanus sir
 our vessel is of tyre in it the king
 a man who for this three months hath not spoken
 to any one nor taken sustenance
 but to prorogue his grief
lysimachus upon what ground is his distemperature
helicanus twould be too tedious to repeat
 but the main grief springs from the loss
 of a beloved daughter and a wife
lysimachus may we not see him
helicanus you may
 but bootless is your sight he will not speak to any
lysimachus yet let me obtain my wish
helicanus behold him
 pericles discovered
 this was a goodly person
 till the disaster that one mortal night
 drove him to this
lysimachus sir king all hail the gods preserve you
 hail royal sir
helicanus it is in vain he will not speak to you
first lord sir
 we have a maid in mytilene i durst wager
 would win some words of him
lysimachus tis well bethought
 she questionless with her sweet harmony
 and other chosen attractions would allure
 and make a battery through his deafen'd parts
 which now are midway stopp'd
 she is all happy as the fairest of all
 and with her fellow maids is now upon
 the leafy shelter that abuts against
 the island's side
 whispers a lord who goes off in the barge of
 lysimachus
helicanus sure all's effectless yet nothing we'll omit
 that bears recovery's name but since your kindness
 we have stretch'd thus far let us beseech you
 that for our gold we may provision have
 wherein we are not destitute for want
 but weary for the staleness
lysimachus o sir a courtesy
 which if we should deny the most just gods
 for every graff would send a caterpillar
 and so afflict our province yet once more
 let me entreat to know at large the cause
 of your king's sorrow
helicanus sit sir i will recount it to you
 but see i am prevented
 reenter from the barge lord with marina and a
 young lady
lysimachus o here is
 the lady that i sent for welcome fair one
 is't not a goodly presence
helicanus she's a gallant lady
lysimachus she's such a one that were i well assured
 came of a gentle kind and noble stock
 i'ld wish no better choice and think me rarely wed
 fair one all goodness that consists in bounty
 expect even here where is a kingly patient
 if that thy prosperous and artificial feat
 can draw him but to answer thee in aught
 thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
 as thy desires can wish
marina sir i will use
 my utmost skill in his recovery provided
 that none but i and my companion maid
 be suffer'd to come near him
lysimachus come let us leave her
 and the gods make her prosperous
 marina sings
lysimachus mark'd he your music
marina no nor look'd on us
lysimachus see she will speak to him
marina hail sir my lord lend ear
pericles hum ha
marina i am a maid
 my lord that ne'er before invited eyes
 but have been gazed on like a comet she speaks
 my lord that may be hath endured a grief
 might equal yours if both were justly weigh'd
 though wayward fortune did malign my state
 my derivation was from ancestors
 who stood equivalent with mighty kings
 but time hath rooted out my parentage
 and to the world and awkward casualties
 bound me in servitude
 aside
 i will desist
 but there is something glows upon my cheek
 and whispers in mine ear go not till he speak'
pericles my fortunesparentagegood parentage
 to equal minewas it not thus what say you
marina i said my lord if you did know my parentage
 you would not do me violence
pericles i do think so pray you turn your eyes upon me
 you are like something thatwhat countrywoman
 here of these shores
marina no nor of any shores
 yet i was mortally brought forth and am
 no other than i appear
pericles i am great with woe and shall deliver weeping
 my dearest wife was like this maid and such a one
 my daughter might have been my queen's square brows
 her stature to an inch as wandlike straight
 as silvervoiced her eyes as jewellike
 and cased as richly in pace another juno
 who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry
 the more she gives them speech where do you live
marina where i am but a stranger from the deck
 you may discern the place
pericles where were you bred
 and how achieved you these endowments which
 you make more rich to owe
marina if i should tell my history it would seem
 like lies disdain'd in the reporting
pericles prithee speak
 falseness cannot come from thee for thou look'st
 modest as justice and thou seem'st a palace
 for the crown'd truth to dwell in i will
 believe thee
 and make my senses credit thy relation
 to points that seem impossible for thou look'st
 like one i loved indeed what were thy friends
 didst thou not say when i did push thee back
 which was when i perceived theethat thou camest
 from good descending
marina so indeed i did
pericles report thy parentage i think thou said'st
 thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury
 and that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine
 if both were open'd
marina some such thing
 i said and said no more but what my thoughts
 did warrant me was likely
pericles tell thy story
 if thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
 of my endurance thou art a man and i
 have suffer'd like a girl yet thou dost look
 like patience gazing on kings graves and smiling
 extremity out of act what were thy friends
 how lost thou them thy name my most kind virgin
 recount i do beseech thee come sit by me
marina my name is marina
pericles o i am mock'd
 and thou by some incensed god sent hither
 to make the world to laugh at me
marina patience good sir
 or here i'll cease
pericles nay i'll be patient
 thou little know'st how thou dost startle me
 to call thyself marina
marina the name
 was given me by one that had some power
 my father and a king
pericles how a king's daughter
 and call'd marina
marina you said you would believe me
 but not to be a troubler of your peace
 i will end here
pericles but are you flesh and blood
 have you a working pulse and are no fairy
 motion well speak on where were you born
 and wherefore call'd marina
marina call'd marina
 for i was born at sea
pericles at sea what mother
marina my mother was the daughter of a king
 who died the minute i was born
 as my good nurse lychorida hath oft
 deliver'd weeping
pericles o stop there a little
 aside
 this is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
 did mock sad fools withal this cannot be
 my daughter's buried well where were you bred
 i'll hear you more to the bottom of your story
 and never interrupt you
marina you scorn believe me twere best i did give o'er
pericles i will believe you by the syllable
 of what you shall deliver yet give me leave
 how came you in these parts where were you bred
marina the king my father did in tarsus leave me
 till cruel cleon with his wicked wife
 did seek to murder me and having woo'd
 a villain to attempt it who having drawn to do't
 a crew of pirates came and rescued me
 brought me to mytilene but good sir
 whither will you have me why do you weep
 it may be
 you think me an impostor no good faith
 i am the daughter to king pericles
 if good king pericles be
pericles ho helicanus
helicanus calls my lord
pericles thou art a grave and noble counsellor
 most wise in general tell me if thou canst
 what this maid is or what is like to be
 that thus hath made me weep
helicanus i know not but
 here is the regent sir of mytilene
 speaks nobly of her
lysimachus she would never tell
 her parentage being demanded that
 she would sit still and weep
pericles o helicanus strike me honour'd sir
 give me a gash put me to present pain
 lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
 o'erbear the shores of my mortality
 and drown me with their sweetness o come hither
 thou that beget'st him that did thee beget
 thou that wast born at sea buried at tarsus
 and found at sea again o helicanus
 down on thy knees thank the holy gods as loud
 as thunder threatens us this is marina
 what was thy mother's name tell me but that
 for truth can never be confirm'd enough
 though doubts did ever sleep
marina first sir i pray
 what is your title
pericles i am pericles of tyre but tell me now
 my drown'd queen's name as in the rest you said
 thou hast been godlike perfect
 the heir of kingdoms and another like
 to pericles thy father
marina is it no more to be your daughter than
 to say my mother's name was thaisa
 thaisa was my mother who did end
 the minute i began
pericles now blessing on thee rise thou art my child
 give me fresh garments mine own helicanus
 she is not dead at tarsus as she should have been
 by savage cleon she shall tell thee all
 when thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge
 she is thy very princess who is this
helicanus sir tis the governor of mytilene
 who hearing of your melancholy state
 did come to see you
pericles i embrace you
 give me my robes i am wild in my beholding
 o heavens bless my girl but hark what music
 tell helicanus my marina tell him
 o'er point by point for yet he seems to doubt
 how sure you are my daughter but what music
helicanus my lord i hear none
pericles none
 the music of the spheres list my marina
lysimachus it is not good to cross him give him way
pericles rarest sounds do ye not hear
lysimachus my lord i hear
 music
pericles most heavenly music
 it nips me unto listening and thick slumber
 hangs upon mine eyes let me rest
 sleeps
lysimachus a pillow for his head
 so leave him all well my companion friends
 if this but answer to my just belief
 i'll well remember you
 exeunt all but pericles
 diana appears to pericles as in a vision
diana my temple stands in ephesus hie thee thither
 and do upon mine altar sacrifice
 there when my maiden priests are met together
 before the people all
 reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife
 to mourn thy crosses with thy daughter's call
 and give them repetition to the life
 or perform my bidding or thou livest in woe
 do it and happy by my silver bow
 awake and tell thy dream
 disappears

 led on by heaven and crown'd with joy at last
 in helicanus may you well descry
 a figure of truth of faith of loyalty
 in reverend cerimon there well appears
 the worth that learned charity aye wears
 for wicked cleon and his wife when fame
 had spread their cursed deed and honour'd name
 of pericles to rage the city turn
 that him and his they in his palace burn
 the gods for murder seemed so content
 to punish them although not done but meant
 so on your patience evermore attending
 new joy wait on you here our play has ending

 horns winded enter a lord from hunting with his train
lord huntsman i charge thee tender well my hounds
 brach merriman the poor cur is emboss'd
 and couple clowder with the deepmouth'd brach
 saw'st thou not boy how silver made it good
 at the hedgecorner in the coldest fault
 i would not lose the dog for twenty pound
first huntsman why belman is as good as he my lord
 he cried upon it at the merest loss
 and twice today pick'd out the dullest scent
 trust me i take him for the better dog
lord thou art a fool if echo were as fleet
 i would esteem him worth a dozen such
 but sup them well and look unto them all
 tomorrow i intend to hunt again
first huntsman i will my lord
lord what's here one dead or drunk see doth he breathe
second huntsman he breathes my lord were he not warm'd with ale
 this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly
lord o monstrous beast how like a swine he lies
 grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
 sirs i will practise on this drunken man
 what think you if he were convey'd to bed
 wrapp'd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers
 a most delicious banquet by his bed
 and brave attendants near him when he wakes
 would not the beggar then forget himself
first huntsman believe me lord i think he cannot choose
second huntsman it would seem strange unto him when he waked
lord even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy
 then take him up and manage well the jest
 carry him gently to my fairest chamber
 and hang it round with all my wanton pictures
 balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
 and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
 procure me music ready when he wakes
 to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound
 and if he chance to speak be ready straight
 and with a low submissive reverence
 say what is it your honour will command'
 let one attend him with a silver basin
 full of rosewater and bestrew'd with flowers
 another bear the ewer the third a diaper
 and say will't please your lordship cool your hands'
 some one be ready with a costly suit
 and ask him what apparel he will wear
 another tell him of his hounds and horse
 and that his lady mourns at his disease
 persuade him that he hath been lunatic
 and when he says he is say that he dreams
 for he is nothing but a mighty lord
 this do and do it kindly gentle sirs
 it will be pastime passing excellent
 if it be husbanded with modesty
first huntsman my lord i warrant you we will play our part
 as he shall think by our true diligence
 he is no less than what we say he is
lord take him up gently and to bed with him
 and each one to his office when he wakes
 some bear out sly a trumpet sounds
 sirrah go see what trumpet tis that sounds

 how now who is it
servant an't please your honour players
 that offer service to your lordship
lord bid them come near
 enter players
 now fellows you are welcome
players we thank your honour
lord do you intend to stay with me tonight
a player so please your lordship to accept our duty
lord with all my heart this fellow i remember
 since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son
 twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well
 i have forgot your name but sure that part
 was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd
a player i think twas soto that your honour means
lord tis very true thou didst it excellent
 well you are come to me in a happy time
 the rather for i have some sport in hand
 wherein your cunning can assist me much
 there is a lord will hear you play tonight
 but i am doubtful of your modesties
 lest overeyeing of his odd behavior
 for yet his honour never heard a play
 you break into some merry passion
 and so offend him for i tell you sirs
 if you should smile he grows impatient
a player fear not my lord we can contain ourselves
 were he the veriest antic in the world
lord go sirrah take them to the buttery
 and give them friendly welcome every one
 let them want nothing that my house affords
 exit one with the players
 sirrah go you to barthol'mew my page
 and see him dress'd in all suits like a lady
 that done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber
 and call him madam do him obeisance
 tell him from me as he will win my love
 he bear himself with honourable action
 such as he hath observed in noble ladies
 unto their lords by them accomplished
 such duty to the drunkard let him do
 with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
 and say what is't your honour will command
 wherein your lady and your humble wife
 may show her duty and make known her love'
 and then with kind embracements tempting kisses
 and with declining head into his bosom
 bid him shed tears as being overjoy'd
 to see her noble lord restored to health
 who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
 no better than a poor and loathsome beggar
 and if the boy have not a woman's gift
 to rain a shower of commanded tears
 an onion will do well for such a shift
 which in a napkin being close convey'd
 shall in despite enforce a watery eye
 see this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst
 anon i'll give thee more instructions
 exit a servingman
 i know the boy will well usurp the grace
 voice gait and action of a gentlewoman
 i long to hear him call the drunkard husband
 and how my men will stay themselves from laughter
 when they do homage to this simple peasant
 i'll in to counsel them haply my presence
 may well abate the overmerry spleen
 which otherwise would grow into extremes

 with his good will and thy good company
 my trusty servant well approved in all

 a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
 and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
tranio mi perdonato gentle master mine
 i am in all affected as yourself
 glad that you thus continue your resolve
 to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
 only good master while we do admire
 this virtue and this moral discipline
 let's be no stoics nor no stocks i pray
 or so devote to aristotle's cheques
 as ovid be an outcast quite abjured
 balk logic with acquaintance that you have
 and practise rhetoric in your common talk
 music and poesy use to quicken you
 the mathematics and the metaphysics
 fall to them as you find your stomach serves you
 no profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en
 in brief sir study what you most affect
lucentio gramercies tranio well dost thou advise

 to make a stale of me amongst these mates
hortensio mates maid how mean you that no mates for you
 unless you were of gentler milder mould
katharina i'faith sir you shall never need to fear
 i wis it is not half way to her heart
 but if it were doubt not her care should be
 to comb your noddle with a threelegg'd stool
 and paint your face and use you like a fool
hortensia from all such devils good lord deliver us
gremio and me too good lord
tranio hush master here's some good pastime toward

 signior baptista for this fiend of hell
 and make her bear the penance of her tongue
baptista gentlemen content ye i am resolved

 exit bianca
 and for i know she taketh most delight
 in music instruments and poetry
 schoolmasters will i keep within my house
 fit to instruct her youth if you hortensio

 to mine own children in good bringing up
 and so farewell katharina you may stay
 for i have more to commune with bianca
 exit
katharina why and i trust i may go too may i not what
 shall i be appointed hours as though belike i
 knew not what to take and what to leave ha
 exit
gremio you may go to the devil's dam your gifts are so
 good here's none will hold you their love is not
 so great hortensio but we may blow our nails
 together and fast it fairly out our cakes dough on
 both sides farewell yet for the love i bear my
 sweet bianca if i can by any means light on a fit
 man to teach her that wherein she delights i will
 wish him to her father
hortensio so will i signior gremio but a word i pray
 though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
 parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both
 that we may yet again have access to our fair
 mistress and be happy rivals in bianco's love to
 labour and effect one thing specially
gremio what's that i pray
hortensio marry sir to get a husband for her sister
gremio a husband a devil
hortensio i say a husband
gremio i say a devil thinkest thou hortensio though
 her father be very rich any man is so very a fool
 to be married to hell
hortensio tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine
 to endure her loud alarums why man there be good
 fellows in the world an a man could light on them
 would take her with all faults and money enough
gremio i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with
 this condition to be whipped at the high cross
 every morning
hortensio faith as you say there's small choice in rotten
 apples but come since this bar in law makes us
 friends it shall be so far forth friendly
 maintained all by helping baptista's eldest daughter
 to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband
 and then have to't a fresh sweet bianca happy man
 be his dole he that runs fastest gets the ring
 how say you signior gremio
gremio i am agreed and would i had given him the best
 horse in padua to begin his wooing that would
 thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the
 house of her come on
 exeunt gremio and hortensio
tranio i pray sir tell me is it possible
 that love should of a sudden take such hold
lucentio o tranio till i found it to be true
 i never thought it possible or likely
 but see while idly i stood looking on
 i found the effect of love in idleness
 and now in plainness do confess to thee
 that art to me as secret and as dear
 as anna to the queen of carthage was
 tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio
 if i achieve not this young modest girl
 counsel me tranio for i know thou canst
 assist me tranio for i know thou wilt
tranio master it is no time to chide you now
 affection is not rated from the heart
 if love have touch'd you nought remains but so
 redime te captum quam queas minimo'
lucentio gramercies lad go forward this contents
 the rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound
tranio master you look'd so longly on the maid
 perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all
lucentio o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face
 such as the daughter of agenor had
 that made great jove to humble him to her hand
 when with his knees he kiss'd the cretan strand
tranio saw you no more mark'd you not how her sister
 began to scold and raise up such a storm
 that mortal ears might hardly endure the din
lucentio tranio i saw her coral lips to move
 and with her breath she did perfume the air
 sacred and sweet was all i saw in her
tranio nay then tis time to stir him from his trance
 i pray awake sir if you love the maid
 bend thoughts and wits to achieve her thus it stands
 her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
 that till the father rid his hands of her
 master your love must live a maid at home
 and therefore has he closely mew'd her up
 because she will not be annoy'd with suitors
lucentio ah tranio what a cruel father's he
 but art thou not advised he took some care
 to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
tranio ay marry am i sir and now tis plotted
lucentio i have it tranio
tranio master for my hand
 both our inventions meet and jump in one
lucentio tell me thine first
tranio you will be schoolmaster
 and undertake the teaching of the maid
 that's your device
lucentio it is may it be done
tranio not possible for who shall bear your part
 and be in padua here vincentio's son
 keep house and ply his book welcome his friends
 visit his countrymen and banquet them
lucentio basta content thee for i have it full
 we have not yet been seen in any house
 nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
 for man or master then it follows thus
 thou shalt be master tranio in my stead
 keep house and port and servants as i should
 i will some other be some florentine
 some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa
 tis hatch'd and shall be so tranio at once
 uncase thee take my colour'd hat and cloak
 when biondello comes he waits on thee
 but i will charm him first to keep his tongue
tranio so had you need
 in brief sir sith it your pleasure is
 and i am tied to be obedient
 for so your father charged me at our parting
 be serviceable to my son quoth he
 although i think twas in another sense
 i am content to be lucentio
 because so well i love lucentio
lucentio tranio be so because lucentio loves
 and let me be a slave to achieve that maid
 whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye
 here comes the rogue
 enter biondello
 sirrah where have you been
biondello where have i been nay how now where are you
 master has my fellow tranio stolen your clothes or
 you stolen his or both pray what's the news
lucentio sirrah come hither tis no time to jest
 and therefore frame your manners to the time
 your fellow tranio here to save my life
 puts my apparel and my countenance on
 and i for my escape have put on his
 for in a quarrel since i came ashore
 i kill'd a man and fear i was descried
 wait you on him i charge you as becomes
 while i make way from hence to save my life
 you understand me
biondello i sir ne'er a whit
lucentio and not a jot of tranio in your mouth
 tranio is changed into lucentio
biondello the better for him would i were so too
tranio so could i faith boy to have the next wish after
 that lucentio indeed had baptista's youngest daughter
 but sirrah not for my sake but your master's i advise
 you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies
 when i am alone why then i am tranio
 but in all places else your master lucentio
lucentio tranio let's go one thing more rests that
 thyself execute to make one among these wooers if
 thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good
 and weighty

scene ii padua before hortensio's house
 enter petruchio and his man grumio
petruchio verona for a while i take my leave
 to see my friends in padua but of all
 my best beloved and approved friend
 hortensio and i trow this is his house
 here sirrah grumio knock i say
grumio knock sir whom should i knock is there man has
 rebused your worship
petruchio villain i say knock me here soundly
grumio knock you here sir why sir what am i sir that
 i should knock you here sir
petruchio villain i say knock me at this gate
 and rap me well or i'll knock your knave's pate
grumio my master is grown quarrelsome i should knock
 you first
 and then i know after who comes by the worst
petruchio will it not be
 faith sirrah an you'll not knock i'll ring it
 i'll try how you can sol fa and sing it
 he wrings him by the ears
grumio help masters help my master is mad
petruchio now knock when i bid you sirrah villain
 enter hortensio
hortensio how now what's the matter my old friend grumio
 and my good friend petruchio how do you all at verona
petruchio signior hortensio come you to part the fray
 con tutto il cuore ben trovato may i say
hortensio alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor
 mio petruchio rise grumio rise we will compound
 this quarrel
grumio nay tis no matter sir what he leges in latin
 if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
 service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap
 him soundly sir well was it fit for a servant to
 use his master so being perhaps for aught i see
 two and thirty a pip out whom would to god i had
 well knock'd at first then had not grumio come by the worst
petruchio a senseless villain good hortensio
 i bade the rascal knock upon your gate
 and could not get him for my heart to do it
grumio knock at the gate o heavens spake you not these
 words plain sirrah knock me here rap me here
 knock me well and knock me soundly and come you
 now with knocking at the gate'
petruchio sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you
hortensio petruchio patience i am grumio's pledge
 why this's a heavy chance twixt him and you
 your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio
 and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
 blows you to padua here from old verona
petruchio such wind as scatters young men through the world
 to seek their fortunes farther than at home
 where small experience grows but in a few
 signior hortensio thus it stands with me
 antonio my father is deceased
 and i have thrust myself into this maze
 haply to wive and thrive as best i may
 crowns in my purse i have and goods at home
 and so am come abroad to see the world
hortensio petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee
 and wish thee to a shrewd illfavour'd wife
 thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel
 and yet i'll promise thee she shall be rich
 and very rich but thou'rt too much my friend
 and i'll not wish thee to her
petruchio signior hortensio twixt such friends as we
 few words suffice and therefore if thou know
 one rich enough to be petruchio's wife
 as wealth is burden of my wooing dance
 be she as foul as was florentius love
 as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
 as socrates xanthippe or a worse
 she moves me not or not removes at least
 affection's edge in me were she as rough
 as are the swelling adriatic seas
 i come to wive it wealthily in padua
 if wealthily then happily in padua
grumio nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his
 mind is why give him gold enough and marry him to
 a puppet or an agletbaby or an old trot with ne'er
 a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases
 as two and fifty horses why nothing comes amiss
 so money comes withal
hortensio petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in
 i will continue that i broach'd in jest
 i can petruchio help thee to a wife
 with wealth enough and young and beauteous
 brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
 her only fault and that is faults enough
 is that she is intolerable curst
 and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
 that were my state far worser than it is
 i would not wed her for a mine of gold
petruchio hortensio peace thou know'st not gold's effect
 tell me her father's name and tis enough
 for i will board her though she chide as loud
 as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
hortensio her father is baptista minola
 an affable and courteous gentleman
 her name is katharina minola
 renown'd in padua for her scolding tongue
petruchio i know her father though i know not her
 and he knew my deceased father well
 i will not sleep hortensio till i see her
 and therefore let me be thus bold with you
 to give you over at this first encounter
 unless you will accompany me thither
grumio i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts
 o my word an she knew him as well as i do she
 would think scolding would do little good upon him
 she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so
 why that's nothing an he begin once he'll rail in
 his ropetricks i'll tell you what sir an she
 stand him but a little he will throw a figure in
 her face and so disfigure her with it that she
 shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat
 you know him not sir
hortensio tarry petruchio i must go with thee
 for in baptista's keep my treasure is
 he hath the jewel of my life in hold
 his youngest daughter beautiful binaca
 and her withholds from me and other more
 suitors to her and rivals in my love
 supposing it a thing impossible
 for those defects i have before rehearsed
 that ever katharina will be woo'd
 therefore this order hath baptista ta'en
 that none shall have access unto bianca
 till katharina the curst have got a husband
grumio katharina the curst
 a title for a maid of all titles the worst
hortensio now shall my friend petruchio do me grace
 and offer me disguised in sober robes
 to old baptista as a schoolmaster
 well seen in music to instruct bianca
 that so i may by this device at least
 have leave and leisure to make love to her
 and unsuspected court her by herself
grumio here's no knavery see to beguile the old folks
 how the young folks lay their heads together
 enter gremio and lucentio disguised
 master master look about you who goes there ha
hortensio peace grumio it is the rival of my love
 petruchio stand by a while
grumio a proper stripling and an amorous
gremio o very well i have perused the note
 hark you sir i'll have them very fairly bound
 all books of love see that at any hand
 and see you read no other lectures to her
 you understand me over and beside
 signior baptista's liberality
 i'll mend it with a largess take your paper too
 and let me have them very well perfumed
 for she is sweeter than perfume itself
 to whom they go to what will you read to her
lucentio whate'er i read to her i'll plead for you
 as for my patron stand you so assured
 as firmly as yourself were still in place
 yea and perhaps with more successful words
 than you unless you were a scholar sir
gremio o this learning what a thing it is
grumio o this woodcock what an ass it is
petruchio peace sirrah
hortensio grumio mum god save you signior gremio
gremio and you are well met signior hortensio
 trow you whither i am going to baptista minola
 i promised to inquire carefully
 about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca
 and by good fortune i have lighted well
 on this young man for learning and behavior
 fit for her turn well read in poetry
 and other books good ones i warrant ye
hortensio tis well and i have met a gentleman
 hath promised me to help me to another
 a fine musician to instruct our mistress
 so shall i no whit be behind in duty
 to fair bianca so beloved of me
gremio beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove
grumio and that his bags shall prove
hortensio gremio tis now no time to vent our love
 listen to me and if you speak me fair
 i'll tell you news indifferent good for either
 here is a gentleman whom by chance i met
 upon agreement from us to his liking
 will undertake to woo curst katharina
 yea and to marry her if her dowry please
gremio so said so done is well
 hortensio have you told him all her faults
petruchio i know she is an irksome brawling scold
 if that be all masters i hear no harm
gremio no say'st me so friend what countryman
petruchio born in verona old antonio's son
 my father dead my fortune lives for me
 and i do hope good days and long to see
gremio o sir such a life with such a wife were strange
 but if you have a stomach to't i god's name
 you shall have me assisting you in all
 but will you woo this wildcat
petruchio will i live
grumio will he woo her ay or i'll hang her
petruchio why came i hither but to that intent
 think you a little din can daunt mine ears
 have i not in my time heard lions roar
 have i not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
 rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
 have i not heard great ordnance in the field
 and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies
 have i not in a pitched battle heard
 loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang
 and do you tell me of a woman's tongue
 that gives not half so great a blow to hear
 as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire
 tush tush fear boys with bugs
grumio for he fears none
gremio hortensio hark
 this gentleman is happily arrived
 my mind presumes for his own good and ours
hortensio i promised we would be contributors
 and bear his charging of wooing whatsoe'er
gremio and so we will provided that he win her
grumio i would i were as sure of a good dinner
 enter tranio brave and biondello
tranio gentlemen god save you if i may be bold
 tell me i beseech you which is the readiest way
 to the house of signior baptista minola
biondello he that has the two fair daughters is't he you mean

tranio and if i be sir is it any offence
gremio no if without more words you will get you hence
tranio why sir i pray are not the streets as free
 for me as for you
gremio but so is not she
tranio for what reason i beseech you
gremio for this reason if you'll know
 that she's the choice love of signior gremio
hortensio that she's the chosen of signior hortensio
tranio softly my masters if you be gentlemen
 do me this right hear me with patience
 baptista is a noble gentleman
 to whom my father is not all unknown
 and were his daughter fairer than she is
 she may more suitors have and me for one
 fair leda's daughter had a thousand wooers
 then well one more may fair bianca have
 and so she shall lucentio shall make one
 though paris came in hope to speed alone
gremio what this gentleman will outtalk us all
lucentio sir give him head i know he'll prove a jade
petruchio hortensio to what end are all these words
hortensio sir let me be so bold as ask you
 did you yet ever see baptista's daughter
tranio no sir but hear i do that he hath two
 the one as famous for a scolding tongue
 as is the other for beauteous modesty
petruchio sir sir the first's for me let her go by
gremio yea leave that labour to great hercules
 and let it be more than alcides twelve
petruchio sir understand you this of me in sooth
 the youngest daughter whom you hearken for
 her father keeps from all access of suitors
 and will not promise her to any man
 until the elder sister first be wed
 the younger then is free and not before
tranio if it be so sir that you are the man
 must stead us all and me amongst the rest
 and if you break the ice and do this feat
 achieve the elder set the younger free
 for our access whose hap shall be to have her
 will not so graceless be to be ingrate
hortensio sir you say well and well you do conceive
 and since you do profess to be a suitor
 you must as we do gratify this gentleman
 to whom we all rest generally beholding
tranio sir i shall not be slack in sign whereof
 please ye we may contrive this afternoon
 and quaff carouses to our mistress health
 and do as adversaries do in law
 strive mightily but eat and drink as friends
grumio

 with biondello bearing a lute and books
gremio good morrow neighbour baptista
baptista good morrow neighbour gremio
 god save you gentlemen
petruchio and you good sir pray have you not a daughter
 call'd katharina fair and virtuous
baptista i have a daughter sir called katharina
gremio you are too blunt go to it orderly
petruchio you wrong me signior gremio give me leave
 i am a gentleman of verona sir
 that hearing of her beauty and her wit
 her affability and bashful modesty
 her wondrous qualities and mild behavior
 am bold to show myself a forward guest
 within your house to make mine eye the witness
 of that report which i so oft have heard
 and for an entrance to my entertainment
 i do present you with a man of mine
 presenting hortensio
 cunning in music and the mathematics
 to instruct her fully in those sciences
 whereof i know she is not ignorant
 accept of him or else you do me wrong
 his name is licio born in mantua
baptista you're welcome sir and he for your good sake
 but for my daughter katharina this i know
 she is not for your turn the more my grief
petruchio i see you do not mean to part with her
 or else you like not of my company
baptista mistake me not i speak but as i find
 whence are you sir what may i call your name
petruchio petruchio is my name antonio's son
 a man well known throughout all italy
baptista i know him well you are welcome for his sake
gremio saving your tale petruchio i pray
 let us that are poor petitioners speak too
 baccare you are marvellous forward
petruchio o pardon me signior gremio i would fain be doing
gremio i doubt it not sir but you will curse your
 wooing neighbour this is a gift very grateful i am
 sure of it to express the like kindness myself
 that have been more kindly beholding to you than
 any freely give unto you this young scholar
 presenting lucentio
 that hath been long studying at rheims as cunning
 in greek latin and other languages as the other
 in music and mathematics his name is cambio pray
 accept his service
baptista a thousand thanks signior gremio
 welcome good cambio
 to tranio
 but gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger
 may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming
tranio pardon me sir the boldness is mine own
 that being a stranger in this city here
 do make myself a suitor to your daughter
 unto bianca fair and virtuous
 nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
 in the preferment of the eldest sister
 this liberty is all that i request
 that upon knowledge of my parentage
 i may have welcome mongst the rest that woo
 and free access and favour as the rest
 and toward the education of your daughters
 i here bestow a simple instrument
 and this small packet of greek and latin books
 if you accept them then their worth is great
baptista lucentio is your name of whence i pray
tranio of pisa sir son to vincentio
baptista a mighty man of pisa by report
 i know him well you are very welcome sir
 take you the lute and you the set of books
 you shall go see your pupils presently
 holla within
 enter a servant
 sirrah lead these gentlemen
 to my daughters and tell them both
 these are their tutors bid them use them well
 exit servant with lucentio and hortensio
 biondello following
 we will go walk a little in the orchard
 and then to dinner you are passing welcome
 and so i pray you all to think yourselves
petruchio signior baptista my business asketh haste
 and every day i cannot come to woo
 you knew my father well and in him me
 left solely heir to all his lands and goods
 which i have better'd rather than decreased
 then tell me if i get your daughter's love
 what dowry shall i have with her to wife
baptista after my death the one half of my lands
 and in possession twenty thousand crowns
petruchio and for that dowry i'll assure her of
 her widowhood be it that she survive me
 in all my lands and leases whatsoever
 let specialties be therefore drawn between us
 that covenants may be kept on either hand
baptista ay when the special thing is well obtain'd
 that is her love for that is all in all
petruchio why that is nothing for i tell you father
 i am as peremptory as she proudminded
 and where two raging fires meet together
 they do consume the thing that feeds their fury
 though little fire grows great with little wind
 yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
 so i to her and so she yields to me
 for i am rough and woo not like a babe
baptista well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
 but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words
petruchio ay to the proof as mountains are for winds
 that shake not though they blow perpetually
 reenter hortensio with his head broke
baptista how now my friend why dost thou look so pale
hortensio for fear i promise you if i look pale
baptista what will my daughter prove a good musician
hortensio i think she'll sooner prove a soldier
 iron may hold with her but never lutes
baptista why then thou canst not break her to the lute
hortensio why no for she hath broke the lute to me
 i did but tell her she mistook her frets
 and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering
 when with a most impatient devilish spirit
 frets call you these quoth she i'll fume
 with them'
 and with that word she struck me on the head
 and through the instrument my pate made way
 and there i stood amazed for a while
 as on a pillory looking through the lute
 while she did call me rascal fiddler
 and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms
 as had she studied to misuse me so
petruchio now by the world it is a lusty wench
 i love her ten times more than e'er i did
 o how i long to have some chat with her
baptista well go with me and be not so discomfited
 proceed in practise with my younger daughter
 she's apt to learn and thankful for good turns
 signior petruchio will you go with us
 or shall i send my daughter kate to you
petruchio i pray you do
 exeunt all but petruchio
 i will attend her here
 and woo her with some spirit when she comes
 say that she rail why then i'll tell her plain
 she sings as sweetly as a nightingale
 say that she frown i'll say she looks as clear
 as morning roses newly wash'd with dew
 say she be mute and will not speak a word
 then i'll commend her volubility
 and say she uttereth piercing eloquence
 if she do bid me pack i'll give her thanks
 as though she bid me stay by her a week
 if she deny to wed i'll crave the day
 when i shall ask the banns and when be married
 but here she comes and now petruchio speak
 enter katharina
 good morrow kate for that's your name i hear
katharina well have you heard but something hard of hearing
 they call me katharina that do talk of me
petruchio you lie in faith for you are call'd plain kate
 and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst
 but kate the prettiest kate in christendom
 kate of kate hall my superdainty kate
 for dainties are all kates and therefore kate
 take this of me kate of my consolation
 hearing thy mildness praised in every town
 thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded
 yet not so deeply as to thee belongs
 myself am moved to woo thee for my wife
katharina moved in good time let him that moved you hither
 remove you hence i knew you at the first
 you were a moveable
petruchio why what's a moveable
katharina a join'dstool
petruchio thou hast hit it come sit on me
katharina asses are made to bear and so are you
petruchio women are made to bear and so are you
katharina no such jade as you if me you mean
petruchio alas good kate i will not burden thee
 for knowing thee to be but young and light
katharina too light for such a swain as you to catch
 and yet as heavy as my weight should be
petruchio should be shouldbuzz
katharina well ta'en and like a buzzard
petruchio o slowwing'd turtle shall a buzzard take thee
katharina ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
petruchio come come you wasp i faith you are too angry
katharina if i be waspish best beware my sting
petruchio my remedy is then to pluck it out
katharina ay if the fool could find it where it lies
petruchio who knows not where a wasp does
 wear his sting in his tail
katharina in his tongue
petruchio whose tongue
katharina yours if you talk of tails and so farewell
petruchio what with my tongue in your tail nay come again
 good kate i am a gentleman
katharina that i'll try
 she strikes him
petruchio i swear i'll cuff you if you strike again
katharina so may you lose your arms
 if you strike me you are no gentleman
 and if no gentleman why then no arms
petruchio a herald kate o put me in thy books
katharina what is your crest a coxcomb
petruchio a combless cock so kate will be my hen
katharina no cock of mine you crow too like a craven
petruchio nay come kate come you must not look so sour
katharina it is my fashion when i see a crab
petruchio why here's no crab and therefore look not sour
katharina there is there is
petruchio then show it me
katharina had i a glass i would
petruchio what you mean my face
katharina well aim'd of such a young one
petruchio now by saint george i am too young for you
katharina yet you are wither'd
petruchio tis with cares
katharina i care not
petruchio nay hear you kate in sooth you scape not so
katharina i chafe you if i tarry let me go
petruchio no not a whit i find you passing gentle
 twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen
 and now i find report a very liar
 for thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous
 but slow in speech yet sweet as springtime flowers
 thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
 nor bite the lip as angry wenches will
 nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
 but thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers
 with gentle conference soft and affable
 why does the world report that kate doth limp
 o slanderous world kate like the hazeltwig
 is straight and slender and as brown in hue
 as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
 o let me see thee walk thou dost not halt
katharina go fool and whom thou keep'st command
petruchio did ever dian so become a grove
 as kate this chamber with her princely gait
 o be thou dian and let her be kate
 and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful
katharina where did you study all this goodly speech
petruchio it is extempore from my motherwit
katharina a witty mother witless else her son
petruchio am i not wise
katharina yes keep you warm
petruchio marry so i mean sweet katharina in thy bed
 and therefore setting all this chat aside
 thus in plain terms your father hath consented
 that you shall be my wife your dowry greed on
 and will you nill you i will marry you
 now kate i am a husband for your turn
 for by this light whereby i see thy beauty
 thy beauty that doth make me like thee well
 thou must be married to no man but me
 for i am he am born to tame you kate
 and bring you from a wild kate to a kate
 conformable as other household kates
 here comes your father never make denial
 i must and will have katharina to my wife
 reenter baptista gremio and tranio
baptista now signior petruchio how speed you with my daughter
petruchio how but well sir how but well
 it were impossible i should speed amiss
baptista why how now daughter katharina in your dumps
katharina call you me daughter now i promise you
 you have show'd a tender fatherly regard
 to wish me wed to one half lunatic
 a madcup ruffian and a swearing jack
 that thinks with oaths to face the matter out
petruchio father tis thus yourself and all the world
 that talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her
 if she be curst it is for policy
 for she's not froward but modest as the dove
 she is not hot but temperate as the morn
 for patience she will prove a second grissel
 and roman lucrece for her chastity
 and to conclude we have greed so well together
 that upon sunday is the weddingday
katharina i'll see thee hang'd on sunday first
gremio hark petruchio she says she'll see thee
 hang'd first
tranio is this your speeding nay then good night our part
petruchio be patient gentlemen i choose her for myself
 if she and i be pleased what's that to you
 tis bargain'd twixt us twain being alone
 that she shall still be curst in company
 i tell you tis incredible to believe
 how much she loves me o the kindest kate
 she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
 she vied so fast protesting oath on oath
 that in a twink she won me to her love
 o you are novices tis a world to see
 how tame when men and women are alone
 a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
 give me thy hand kate i will unto venice
 to buy apparel gainst the weddingday
 provide the feast father and bid the guests
 i will be sure my katharina shall be fine
baptista i know not what to say but give me your hands
 god send you joy petruchio tis a match

 amen say we we will be witnesses
tranio 
petruchio father and wife and gentlemen adieu
 i will to venice sunday comes apace

 and kiss me kate we will be married o'sunday
 exeunt petruchio and katharina severally
gremio was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly
baptista faith gentlemen now i play a merchant's part
 and venture madly on a desperate mart
tranio twas a commodity lay fretting by you
 twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
baptista the gain i seek is quiet in the match
gremio no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
 but now baptists to your younger daughter
 now is the day we long have looked for
 i am your neighbour and was suitor first
tranio and i am one that love bianca more
 than words can witness or your thoughts can guess
gremio youngling thou canst not love so dear as i
tranio graybeard thy love doth freeze
gremio but thine doth fry
 skipper stand back tis age that nourisheth
tranio but youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth
baptista content you gentlemen i will compound this strife
 tis deeds must win the prize and he of both
 that can assure my daughter greatest dower
 shall have my bianca's love
 say signior gremio what can you assure her
gremio first as you know my house within the city
 is richly furnished with plate and gold
 basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands

 in ivory coffers i have stuff'd my crowns
 in cypress chests my arras counterpoints
 costly apparel tents and canopies
 fine linen turkey cushions boss'd with pearl
 valance of venice gold in needlework
 pewter and brass and all things that belong
 to house or housekeeping then at my farm
 i have a hundred milchkine to the pail
 sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls
 and all things answerable to this portion
 myself am struck in years i must confess
 and if i die tomorrow this is hers
 if whilst i live she will be only mine
tranio that only came well in sir list to me
 i am my father's heir and only son
 if i may have your daughter to my wife
 i'll leave her houses three or four as good
 within rich pisa walls as any one
 old signior gremio has in padua
 besides two thousand ducats by the year
 of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure
 what have i pinch'd you signior gremio
gremio two thousand ducats by the year of land
 my land amounts not to so much in all
 that she shall have besides an argosy
 that now is lying in marseilles road
 what have i choked you with an argosy
tranio gremio tis known my father hath no less
 than three great argosies besides two galliases
 and twelve tight galleys these i will assure her
 and twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next
gremio nay i have offer'd all i have no more
 and she can have no more than all i have
 if you like me she shall have me and mine
tranio why then the maid is mine from all the world
 by your firm promise gremio is outvied
baptista i must confess your offer is the best
 and let your father make her the assurance
 she is your own else you must pardon me

 do get their children but in this case of wooing
 a child shall get a sire if i fail not of my cunning

 and when in music we have spent an hour
 your lecture shall have leisure for as much
lucentio preposterous ass that never read so far
 to know the cause why music was ordain'd
 was it not to refresh the mind of man
 after his studies or his usual pain
 then give me leave to read philosophy
 and while i pause serve in your harmony
hortensio sirrah i will not bear these braves of thine
bianca why gentlemen you do me double wrong
 to strive for that which resteth in my choice
 i am no breeching scholar in the schools
 i'll not be tied to hours nor pointed times
 but learn my lessons as i please myself
 and to cut off all strife here sit we down
 take you your instrument play you the whiles

 pedascule i'll watch you better yet
bianca in time i may believe yet i mistrust
lucentio mistrust it not for sure aeacides
 was ajax call'd so from his grandfather
bianca i must believe my master else i promise you
 i should be arguing still upon that doubt
 but let it rest now licio to you
 good masters take it not unkindly pray
 that i have been thus pleasant with you both
hortensio you may go walk and give me leave a while
 my lessons make no music in three parts
lucentio are you so formal sir well i must wait
 aside
 and watch withal for but i be deceived
 our fine musician groweth amorous
hortensio madam before you touch the instrument
 to learn the order of my fingering
 i must begin with rudiments of art
 to teach you gamut in a briefer sort
 more pleasant pithy and effectual
 than hath been taught by any of my trade
 and there it is in writing fairly drawn
bianca why i am past my gamut long ago
hortensio yet read the gamut of hortensio
bianca reads 'gamut i am the ground of all accord
 a re to plead hortensio's passion
 b mi bianca take him for thy lord
 c fa ut that loves with all affection

 lucentio and others attendants
baptista to tranio signior lucentio this is the
 pointed day
 that katharina and petruchio should be married

 what says lucentio to this shame of ours
katharina no shame but mine i must forsooth be forced
 to give my hand opposed against my heart
 unto a madbrain rudesby full of spleen
 who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure
 i told you i he was a frantic fool
 hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior
 and to be noted for a merry man
 he'll woo a thousand point the day of marriage
 make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns
 yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd
 now must the world point at poor katharina
 and say lo there is mad petruchio's wife
 if it would please him come and marry her'
tranio patience good katharina and baptista too
 upon my life petruchio means but well
 whatever fortune stays him from his word
 though he be blunt i know him passing wise
 though he be merry yet withal he's honest
katharina would katharina had never seen him though
 exit weeping followed by bianca and others
baptista go girl i cannot blame thee now to weep
 for such an injury would vex a very saint
 much more a shrew of thy impatient humour
 enter biondello
biondello master master news old news and such news as
 you never heard of
baptista is it new and old too how may that be
biondello why is it not news to hear of petruchio's coming
baptista is he come
biondello why no sir
baptista what then
biondello he is coming
baptista when will he be here
biondello when he stands where i am and sees you there
tranio but say what to thine old news
biondello why petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
 jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair
 of boots that have been candlecases one buckled
 another laced an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
 townarmory with a broken hilt and chapeless
 with two broken points his horse hipped with an
 old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred
 besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose
 in the chine troubled with the lampass infected
 with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with
 spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives
 stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the
 bots swayed in the back and shouldershotten
 nearlegged before and with a halfchequed bit
 and a headstall of sheeps leather which being
 restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been
 often burst and now repaired with knots one girth
 six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure
 which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
 in studs and here and there pieced with packthread
baptista who comes with him
biondello o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned
 like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a
 kersey boothose on the other gartered with a red
 and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty
 fancies pricked in't for a feather a monster a
 very monster in apparel and not like a christian
 footboy or a gentleman's lackey
tranio tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion
 yet oftentimes he goes but meanapparell'd
baptista i am glad he's come howsoe'er he comes
biondello why sir he comes not
baptista didst thou not say he comes
biondello who that petruchio came
baptista ay that petruchio came
biondello no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back
baptista why that's all one

petruchio come where be these gallants who's at home
baptista you are welcome sir
petruchio and yet i come not well
baptista and yet you halt not
tranio not so well apparell'd
 as i wish you were
petruchio were it better i should rush in thus
 but where is kate where is my lovely bride
 how does my father gentles methinks you frown
 and wherefore gaze this goodly company
 as if they saw some wondrous monument
 some comet or unusual prodigy
baptista why sir you know this is your weddingday
 first were we sad fearing you would not come
 now sadder that you come so unprovided
 fie doff this habit shame to your estate
 an eyesore to our solemn festival
tranio and tells us what occasion of import
 hath all so long detain'd you from your wife
 and sent you hither so unlike yourself
petruchio tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
 sufficeth i am come to keep my word
 though in some part enforced to digress
 which at more leisure i will so excuse
 as you shall well be satisfied withal
 but where is kate i stay too long from her
 the morning wears tis time we were at church
tranio see not your bride in these unreverent robes
 go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
petruchio not i believe me thus i'll visit her
baptista but thus i trust you will not marry her
petruchio good sooth even thus therefore ha done with words
 to me she's married not unto my clothes
 could i repair what she will wear in me
 as i can change these poor accoutrements
 twere well for kate and better for myself
 but what a fool am i to chat with you
 when i should bid good morrow to my bride
 and seal the title with a lovely kiss
 exeunt petruchio and grumio
tranio he hath some meaning in his mad attire
 we will persuade him be it possible
 to put on better ere he go to church
baptista i'll after him and see the event of this
 exeunt baptista gremio and attendants
tranio but to her love concerneth us to add
 her father's liking which to bring to pass
 as i before unparted to your worship
 i am to get a manwhate'er he be
 it skills not much we'll fit him to our turn
 and he shall be vincentio of pisa
 and make assurance here in padua
 of greater sums than i have promised
 so shall you quietly enjoy your hope
 and marry sweet bianca with consent
lucentio were it not that my fellowschoolmaster
 doth watch bianca's steps so narrowly
 twere good methinks to steal our marriage
 which once perform'd let all the world say no
 i'll keep mine own despite of all the world
tranio that by degrees we mean to look into
 and watch our vantage in this business
 we'll overreach the greybeard gremio
 the narrowprying father minola
 the quaint musician amorous licio
 all for my master's sake lucentio
 reenter gremio
 signior gremio came you from the church
gremio as willingly as e'er i came from school
tranio and is the bride and bridegroom coming home
gremio a bridegroom say you tis a groom indeed
 a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find
tranio curster than she why tis impossible
gremio why he's a devil a devil a very fiend
tranio why she's a devil a devil the devil's dam
gremio tut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him
 i'll tell you sir lucentio when the priest
 should ask if katharina should be his wife
 ay by gogswouns quoth he and swore so loud
 that allamazed the priest let fall the book
 and as he stoop'd again to take it up
 the madbrain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
 that down fell priest and book and book and priest
 now take them up quoth he if any list'
tranio what said the wench when he rose again
gremio trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore
 as if the vicar meant to cozen him
 but after many ceremonies done
 he calls for wine a health quoth he as if
 he had been aboard carousing to his mates
 after a storm quaff'd off the muscadel
 and threw the sops all in the sexton's face
 having no other reason
 but that his beard grew thin and hungerly
 and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking
 this done he took the bride about the neck
 and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
 that at the parting all the church did echo
 and i seeing this came thence for very shame
 and after me i know the rout is coming
 such a mad marriage never was before
 hark hark i hear the minstrels play
 music

 reenter petruchio
petruchio thus have i politicly begun my reign
 and tis my hope to end successfully
 my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
 and till she stoop she must not be fullgorged
 for then she never looks upon her lure
 another way i have to man my haggard
 to make her come and know her keeper's call
 that is to watch her as we watch these kites
 that bate and beat and will not be obedient
 she eat no meat today nor none shall eat
 last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
 as with the meat some undeserved fault
 i'll find about the making of the bed
 and here i'll fling the pillow there the bolster
 this way the coverlet another way the sheets
 ay and amid this hurly i intend
 that all is done in reverend care of her
 and in conclusion she shall watch all night
 and if she chance to nod i'll rail and brawl
 and with the clamour keep her still awake
 this is a way to kill a wife with kindness
 and thus i'll curb her mad and headstrong humour
 he that knows better how to tame a shrew
 now let him speak tis charity to show

 loved none in the world so well as lucentio
tranio o despiteful love unconstant womankind

 for such a one as leaves a gentleman
 and makes a god of such a cullion
 know sir that i am call'd hortensio
tranio signior hortensio i have often heard
 of your entire affection to bianca
 and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness
 i will with you if you be so contented
 forswear bianca and her love for ever
hortensio see how they kiss and court signior lucentio
 here is my hand and here i firmly vow
 never to woo her no more but do forswear her
 as one unworthy all the former favours
 that i have fondly flatter'd her withal
tranio and here i take the unfeigned oath
 never to marry with her though she would entreat
 fie on her see how beastly she doth court him
hortensio would all the world but he had quite forsworn
 for me that i may surely keep mine oath
 i will be married to a wealthy widow
 ere three days pass which hath as long loved me
 as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard
 and so farewell signior lucentio
 kindness in women not their beauteous looks
 shall win my love and so i take my leave

 this favour will i do you for his sake
 and think it not the worst of an your fortunes
 that you are like to sir vincentio
 his name and credit shall you undertake

 because his fathers are more beautiful
 or is the adder better than the eel
 because his painted skin contents the eye
 o no good kate neither art thou the worse
 for this poor furniture and mean array

 which runs himself and catches for his master
petruchio a good swift simile but something currish

 to come to me forthwith
 exit biondello
petruchio o ho entreat her

hortensio i am afraid sir
 do what you can yours will not be entreated
 reenter biondello

biondello she says you have some goodly jest in hand
 she will not come she bids you come to her
petruchio worse and worse she will not come o vile
 intolerable not to be endured
 sirrah grumio go to your mistress
 say i command her to come to me
 exit grumio
hortensio i know her answer
petruchio what
hortensio she will not
petruchio the fouler fortune mine and there an end
baptista now by my holidame here comes katharina
 reenter katarina
katharina what is your will sir that you send for me
petruchio where is your sister and hortensio's wife
katharina they sit conferring by the parlor fire
petruchio go fetch them hither if they deny to come
 swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
 away i say and bring them hither straight
 exit katharina
lucentio here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
hortensio and so it is i wonder what it bodes
petruchio marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life
 and awful rule and right supremacy
 and to be short what not that's sweet and happy
baptista now fair befal thee good petruchio
 the wager thou hast won and i will add
 unto their losses twenty thousand crowns
 another dowry to another daughter
 for she is changed as she had never been
petruchio nay i will win my wager better yet
 and show more sign of her obedience
 her newbuilt virtue and obedience
 see where she comes and brings your froward wives
 as prisoners to her womanly persuasion
 reenter katharina with bianca and widow
 katharina that cap of yours becomes you not
 off with that bauble throw it underfoot
widow lord let me never have a cause to sigh
 till i be brought to such a silly pass
bianca fie what a foolish duty call you this
lucentio i would your duty were as foolish too
 the wisdom of your duty fair bianca
 hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime
bianca the more fool you for laying on my duty
petruchio katharina i charge thee tell these headstrong women
 what duty they do owe their lords and husbands
widow come come you're mocking we will have no telling
petruchio come on i say and first begin with her
widow she shall not
petruchio i say she shall and first begin with her
katharina fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
 and dart not scornful glances from those eyes
 to wound thy lord thy king thy governor
 it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
 confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
 and in no sense is meet or amiable
 a woman moved is like a fountain troubled
 muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty
 and while it is so none so dry or thirsty
 will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
 thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
 thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
 and for thy maintenance commits his body
 to painful labour both by sea and land
 to watch the night in storms the day in cold
 whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
 and craves no other tribute at thy hands
 but love fair looks and true obedience
 too little payment for so great a debt
 such duty as the subject owes the prince
 even such a woman oweth to her husband
 and when she is froward peevish sullen sour
 and not obedient to his honest will
 what is she but a foul contending rebel
 and graceless traitor to her loving lord
 i am ashamed that women are so simple
 to offer war where they should kneel for peace
 or seek for rule supremacy and sway
 when they are bound to serve love and obey
 why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
 unapt to toil and trouble in the world
 but that our soft conditions and our hearts
 should well agree with our external parts
 come come you froward and unable worms
 my mind hath been as big as one of yours
 my heart as great my reason haply more
 to bandy word for word and frown for frown
 but now i see our lances are but straws
 our strength as weak our weakness past compare
 that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
 then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
 and place your hands below your husband's foot
 in token of which duty if he please
 my hand is ready may it do him ease
petruchio why there's a wench come on and kiss me kate
lucentio well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't
vincentio tis a good hearing when children are toward
lucentio but a harsh hearing when women are froward
petruchio come kate we'll to bed
 we three are married but you two are sped
 to lucentio
 twas i won the wager though you hit the white
 and being a winner god give you good night
 exeunt petruchio and katharina
hortensio now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew

 the tempest
act i
scene ii the island before prospero's cell
 enter prospero and miranda
miranda if by your art my dearest father you have
 put the wild waters in this roar allay them
 the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
 but that the sea mounting to the welkin's cheek
 dashes the fire out o i have suffered
 with those that i saw suffer a brave vessel
 who had no doubt some noble creature in her
 dash'd all to pieces o the cry did knock
 against my very heart poor souls they perish'd
 had i been any god of power i would
 have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
 it should the good ship so have swallow'd and
 the fraughting souls within her
prospero be collected
 no more amazement tell your piteous heart
 there's no harm done
miranda o woe the day
prospero no harm
 i have done nothing but in care of thee
 of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
 art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
 of whence i am nor that i am more better
 than prospero master of a full poor cell
 and thy no greater father
miranda more to know
 did never meddle with my thoughts
prospero tis time
 i should inform thee farther lend thy hand
 and pluck my magic garment from me so
 lays down his mantle
 lie there my art wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
 the direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd
 the very virtue of compassion in thee
 i have with such provision in mine art
 so safely ordered that there is no soul
 no not so much perdition as an hair
 betid to any creature in the vessel
 which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink sit down
 for thou must now know farther
miranda you have often
 begun to tell me what i am but stopp'd
 and left me to a bootless inquisition
 concluding stay not yet'
prospero the hour's now come
 the very minute bids thee ope thine ear
 obey and be attentive canst thou remember
 a time before we came unto this cell
 i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not
 out three years old
miranda certainly sir i can
prospero by what by any other house or person
 of any thing the image tell me that
 hath kept with thy remembrance
miranda tis far off
 and rather like a dream than an assurance
 that my remembrance warrants had i not
 four or five women once that tended me
prospero thou hadst and more miranda but how is it
 that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else
 in the dark backward and abysm of time
 if thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here
 how thou camest here thou mayst
miranda but that i do not
prospero twelve year since miranda twelve year since
 thy father was the duke of milan and
 a prince of power
miranda sir are not you my father
prospero thy mother was a piece of virtue and
 she said thou wast my daughter and thy father
 was duke of milan and thou his only heir
 and princess no worse issued
miranda o the heavens
 what foul play had we that we came from thence
 or blessed was't we did
prospero both both my girl
 by foul play as thou say'st were we heaved thence
 but blessedly holp hither
miranda o my heart bleeds
 to think o the teen that i have turn'd you to
 which is from my remembrance please you farther
prospero my brother and thy uncle call'd antonio
 i pray thee mark methat a brother should
 be so perfidioushe whom next thyself
 of all the world i loved and to him put
 the manage of my state as at that time
 through all the signories it was the first
 and prospero the prime duke being so reputed
 in dignity and for the liberal arts
 without a parallel those being all my study
 the government i cast upon my brother
 and to my state grew stranger being transported
 and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle
 dost thou attend me
miranda sir most heedfully
prospero being once perfected how to grant suits
 how to deny them who to advance and who
 to trash for overtopping new created
 the creatures that were mine i say or changed em
 or else new form'd em having both the key
 of officer and office set all hearts i the state
 to what tune pleased his ear that now he was
 the ivy which had hid my princely trunk
 and suck'd my verdure out on't thou attend'st not
miranda o good sir i do
prospero i pray thee mark me
 i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
 to closeness and the bettering of my mind
 with that which but by being so retired
 o'erprized all popular rate in my false brother
 awaked an evil nature and my trust
 like a good parent did beget of him
 a falsehood in its contrary as great
 as my trust was which had indeed no limit
 a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded
 not only with what my revenue yielded
 but what my power might else exact like one
 who having into truth by telling of it
 made such a sinner of his memory
 to credit his own lie he did believe
 he was indeed the duke out o the substitution
 and executing the outward face of royalty
 with all prerogative hence his ambition growing
 dost thou hear
miranda your tale sir would cure deafness
prospero to have no screen between this part he play'd
 and him he play'd it for he needs will be
 absolute milan me poor man my library
 was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties
 he thinks me now incapable confederates
 so dry he was for swaywi the king of naples
 to give him annual tribute do him homage
 subject his coronet to his crown and bend
 the dukedom yet unbow'dalas poor milan
 to most ignoble stooping
miranda o the heavens
prospero mark his condition and the event then tell me
 if this might be a brother
miranda i should sin
 to think but nobly of my grandmother
 good wombs have borne bad sons
prospero now the condition
 the king of naples being an enemy
 to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit
 which was that he in lieu o the premises
 of homage and i know not how much tribute
 should presently extirpate me and mine
 out of the dukedom and confer fair milan
 with all the honours on my brother whereon
 a treacherous army levied one midnight
 fated to the purpose did antonio open
 the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness
 the ministers for the purpose hurried thence
 me and thy crying self
miranda alack for pity
 i not remembering how i cried out then
 will cry it o'er again it is a hint
 that wrings mine eyes to't
prospero hear a little further
 and then i'll bring thee to the present business
 which now's upon's without the which this story
 were most impertinent
miranda wherefore did they not
 that hour destroy us
prospero well demanded wench
 my tale provokes that question dear they durst not
 so dear the love my people bore me nor set
 a mark so bloody on the business but
 with colours fairer painted their foul ends
 in few they hurried us aboard a bark
 bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
 a rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd
 nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
 instinctively had quit it there they hoist us
 to cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh
 to the winds whose pity sighing back again
 did us but loving wrong
miranda alack what trouble
 was i then to you
prospero o a cherubim
 thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile
 infused with a fortitude from heaven
 when i have deck'd the sea with drops full salt
 under my burthen groan'd which raised in me
 an undergoing stomach to bear up
 against what should ensue
miranda how came we ashore
prospero by providence divine
 some food we had and some fresh water that
 a noble neapolitan gonzalo
 out of his charity being then appointed
 master of this design did give us with
 rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries
 which since have steaded much so of his gentleness
 knowing i loved my books he furnish'd me
 from mine own library with volumes that
 i prize above my dukedom
miranda would i might
 but ever see that man
prospero now i arise
 resumes his mantle
 sit still and hear the last of our seasorrow
 here in this island we arrived and here
 have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit
 than other princesses can that have more time
 for vainer hours and tutors not so careful
miranda heavens thank you for't and now i pray you sir
 for still tis beating in my mind your reason
 for raising this seastorm
prospero know thus far forth
 by accident most strange bountiful fortune
 now my dear lady hath mine enemies
 brought to this shore and by my prescience
 i find my zenith doth depend upon
 a most auspicious star whose influence
 if now i court not but omit my fortunes
 will ever after droop here cease more questions
 thou art inclined to sleep tis a good dulness
 and give it way i know thou canst not choose
 miranda sleeps
 come away servant come i am ready now
 approach my ariel come
 enter ariel
ariel all hail great master grave sir hail i come
 to answer thy best pleasure be't to fly
 to swim to dive into the fire to ride
 on the curl'd clouds to thy strong bidding task
 ariel and all his quality
prospero hast thou spirit
 perform'd to point the tempest that i bade thee
ariel to every article
 i boarded the king's ship now on the beak
 now in the waist the deck in every cabin
 i flamed amazement sometime i'ld divide
 and burn in many places on the topmast
 the yards and bowsprit would i flame distinctly
 then meet and join jove's lightnings the precursors
 o the dreadful thunderclaps more momentary
 and sightoutrunning were not the fire and cracks
 of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune
 seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
 yea his dread trident shake
prospero my brave spirit
 who was so firm so constant that this coil
 would not infect his reason
ariel not a soul
 but felt a fever of the mad and play'd
 some tricks of desperation all but mariners
 plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel
 then all afire with me the king's son ferdinand
 with hair upstaringthen like reeds not hair
 was the first man that leap'd cried hell is empty
 and all the devils are here'
prospero why that's my spirit
 but was not this nigh shore
ariel close by my master
prospero but are they ariel safe
ariel not a hair perish'd
 on their sustaining garments not a blemish
 but fresher than before and as thou badest me
 in troops i have dispersed them bout the isle
 the king's son have i landed by himself
 whom i left cooling of the air with sighs
 in an odd angle of the isle and sitting
 his arms in this sad knot
prospero of the king's ship
 the mariners say how thou hast disposed
 and all the rest o the fleet
ariel safely in harbour
 is the king's ship in the deep nook where once
 thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
 from the stillvex'd bermoothes there she's hid
 the mariners all under hatches stow'd
 who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour
 i have left asleep and for the rest o the fleet
 which i dispersed they all have met again
 and are upon the mediterranean flote
 bound sadly home for naples
 supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
 and his great person perish
prospero ariel thy charge
 exactly is perform'd but there's more work
 what is the time o the day
ariel past the mid season
prospero at least two glasses the time twixt six and now
 must by us both be spent most preciously
ariel is there more toil since thou dost give me pains
 let me remember thee what thou hast promised
 which is not yet perform'd me
prospero how now moody
 what is't thou canst demand
ariel my liberty
prospero before the time be out no more
ariel i prithee
 remember i have done thee worthy service
 told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served
 without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise
 to bate me a full year
prospero dost thou forget
 from what a torment i did free thee
ariel no
prospero thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze
 of the salt deep
 to run upon the sharp wind of the north
 to do me business in the veins o the earth
 when it is baked with frost
ariel i do not sir
prospero thou liest malignant thing hast thou forgot
 the foul witch sycorax who with age and envy
 was grown into a hoop hast thou forgot her
ariel no sir
prospero thou hast where was she born speak tell me
ariel sir in argier
prospero o was she so i must
 once in a month recount what thou hast been
 which thou forget'st this damn'd witch sycorax
 for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
 to enter human hearing from argier
 thou know'st was banish'd for one thing she did
 they would not take her life is not this true
ariel ay sir
prospero this blueeyed hag was hither brought with child
 and here was left by the sailors thou my slave
 as thou report'st thyself wast then her servant
 and for thou wast a spirit too delicate
 to act her earthy and abhorr'd commands
 refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
 by help of her more potent ministers
 and in her most unmitigable rage
 into a cloven pine within which rift
 imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
 a dozen years within which space she died
 and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
 as fast as millwheels strike then was this island
 save for the son that she did litter here
 a freckled whelp hagbornnot honour'd with
 a human shape
ariel yes caliban her son
prospero dull thing i say so he that caliban
 whom now i keep in service thou best know'st
 what torment i did find thee in thy groans
 did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
 of ever angry bears it was a torment
 to lay upon the damn'd which sycorax
 could not again undo it was mine art
 when i arrived and heard thee that made gape
 the pine and let thee out
ariel i thank thee master
prospero if thou more murmur'st i will rend an oak
 and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
 thou hast howl'd away twelve winters
ariel pardon master
 i will be correspondent to command
 and do my spiriting gently
prospero do so and after two days
 i will discharge thee
ariel that's my noble master
 what shall i do say what what shall i do
prospero go make thyself like a nymph o the sea be subject
 to no sight but thine and mine invisible
 to every eyeball else go take this shape
 and hither come in't go hence with diligence
 exit ariel
 awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well awake
miranda the strangeness of your story put
 heaviness in me
prospero shake it off come on
 we'll visit caliban my slave who never
 yields us kind answer
miranda tis a villain sir
 i do not love to look on
prospero but as tis
 we cannot miss him he does make our fire
 fetch in our wood and serves in offices
 that profit us what ho slave caliban
 thou earth thou speak
caliban within there's wood enough within
prospero come forth i say there's other business for thee
 come thou tortoise when
 reenter ariel like a waternymph
 fine apparition my quaint ariel
 hark in thine ear
ariel my lord it shall be done
 exit
prospero thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself
 upon thy wicked dam come forth
 enter caliban
caliban as wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
 with raven's feather from unwholesome fen
 drop on you both a southwest blow on ye
 and blister you all o'er
prospero for this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps
 sidestitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins
 shall for that vast of night that they may work
 all exercise on thee thou shalt be pinch'd
 as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging
 than bees that made em
caliban i must eat my dinner
 this island's mine by sycorax my mother
 which thou takest from me when thou camest first
 thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me
 water with berries in't and teach me how
 to name the bigger light and how the less
 that burn by day and night and then i loved thee
 and show'd thee all the qualities o the isle
 the fresh springs brinepits barren place and fertile
 cursed be i that did so all the charms
 of sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
 for i am all the subjects that you have
 which first was mine own king and here you sty me
 in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me
 the rest o the island
prospero thou most lying slave
 whom stripes may move not kindness i have used thee
 filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee
 in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate
 the honour of my child
caliban o ho o ho would't had been done
 thou didst prevent me i had peopled else
 this isle with calibans
prospero abhorred slave
 which any print of goodness wilt not take
 being capable of all ill i pitied thee
 took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour
 one thing or other when thou didst not savage
 know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like
 a thing most brutish i endow'd thy purposes
 with words that made them known but thy vile race
 though thou didst learn had that in't which
 good natures
 could not abide to be with therefore wast thou
 deservedly confined into this rock
 who hadst deserved more than a prison
caliban you taught me language and my profit on't
 is i know how to curse the red plague rid you
 for learning me your language
prospero hagseed hence
 fetch us in fuel and be quick thou'rt best
 to answer other business shrug'st thou malice
 if thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
 what i command i'll rack thee with old cramps
 fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
 that beasts shall tremble at thy din
caliban no pray thee
 aside
 i must obey his art is of such power
 it would control my dam's god setebos
 and make a vassal of him
prospero so slave hence
 exit caliban
 reenter ariel invisible playing and singing
 ferdinand following
 ariel's song
 come unto these yellow sands
 and then take hands
 courtsied when you have and kiss'd
 the wild waves whist
 foot it featly here and there
 and sweet sprites the burthen bear
 hark hark
 burthen dispersedly within bowwow
 the watchdogs bark
 burthen bowwow
 hark hark i hear
 the strain of strutting chanticleer
 cry cockadiddledow
ferdinand where should this music be i the air or the earth
 it sounds no more and sure it waits upon
 some god o the island sitting on a bank
 weeping again the king my father's wreck
 this music crept by me upon the waters
 allaying both their fury and my passion
 with its sweet air thence i have follow'd it
 or it hath drawn me rather but tis gone
 no it begins again
 ariel sings
 full fathom five thy father lies
 of his bones are coral made
 those are pearls that were his eyes
 nothing of him that doth fade
 but doth suffer a seachange
 into something rich and strange
 seanymphs hourly ring his knell
 burthen dingdong
 hark now i hear themdingdong bell
ferdinand the ditty does remember my drown'd father
 this is no mortal business nor no sound
 that the earth owes i hear it now above me
prospero the fringed curtains of thine eye advance
 and say what thou seest yond
miranda what is't a spirit
 lord how it looks about believe me sir
 it carries a brave form but tis a spirit
prospero no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
 as we have such this gallant which thou seest
 was in the wreck and but he's something stain'd
 with grief that's beauty's canker thou mightst call him
 a goodly person he hath lost his fellows
 and strays about to find em
miranda i might call him
 a thing divine for nothing natural
 i ever saw so noble
prospero aside it goes on i see
 as my soul prompts it spirit fine spirit i'll free thee
 within two days for this
ferdinand most sure the goddess
 on whom these airs attend vouchsafe my prayer
 may know if you remain upon this island
 and that you will some good instruction give
 how i may bear me here my prime request
 which i do last pronounce is o you wonder
 if you be maid or no
miranda no wonder sir
 but certainly a maid
ferdinand my language heavens
 i am the best of them that speak this speech
 were i but where tis spoken
prospero how the best
 what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee
ferdinand a single thing as i am now that wonders
 to hear thee speak of naples he does hear me
 and that he does i weep myself am naples
 who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld
 the king my father wreck'd
miranda alack for mercy
ferdinand yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan
 and his brave son being twain
prospero aside the duke of milan
 and his more braver daughter could control thee
 if now twere fit to do't at the first sight
 they have changed eyes delicate ariel
 i'll set thee free for this
 to ferdinand
 a word good sir
 i fear you have done yourself some wrong a word
miranda why speaks my father so ungently this
 is the third man that e'er i saw the first
 that e'er i sigh'd for pity move my father
 to be inclined my way
ferdinand o if a virgin
 and your affection not gone forth i'll make you
 the queen of naples
prospero soft sir one word more
 aside
 they are both in either's powers but this swift business
 i must uneasy make lest too light winning
 make the prize light
 to ferdinand
 one word more i charge thee
 that thou attend me thou dost here usurp
 the name thou owest not and hast put thyself
 upon this island as a spy to win it
 from me the lord on't
ferdinand no as i am a man
miranda there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple
 if the ill spirit have so fair a house
 good things will strive to dwell with't
prospero follow me
 speak not you for him he's a traitor come
 i'll manacle thy neck and feet together
 seawater shalt thou drink thy food shall be
 the freshbrook muscles wither'd roots and husks
 wherein the acorn cradled follow
ferdinand no
 i will resist such entertainment till
 mine enemy has more power
 draws and is charmed from moving
miranda o dear father
 make not too rash a trial of him for
 he's gentle and not fearful
prospero what i say
 my foot my tutor put thy sword up traitor
 who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience
 is so possess'd with guilt come from thy ward
 for i can here disarm thee with this stick
 and make thy weapon drop
miranda beseech you father
prospero hence hang not on my garments
miranda sir have pity
 i'll be his surety
prospero silence one word more
 shall make me chide thee if not hate thee what
 an advocate for an imposter hush
 thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he
 having seen but him and caliban foolish wench
 to the most of men this is a caliban
 and they to him are angels
miranda my affections
 are then most humble i have no ambition
 to see a goodlier man
prospero come on obey
 thy nerves are in their infancy again
 and have no vigour in them
ferdinand so they are
 my spirits as in a dream are all bound up
 my father's loss the weakness which i feel
 the wreck of all my friends nor this man's threats
 to whom i am subdued are but light to me
 might i but through my prison once a day
 behold this maid all corners else o the earth
 let liberty make use of space enough
 have i in such a prison
prospero aside it works
 to ferdinand
 come on
 thou hast done well fine ariel
 to ferdinand
 follow me
 to ariel
 hark what thou else shalt do me
miranda be of comfort
 my father's of a better nature sir
 than he appears by speech this is unwonted
 which now came from him
prospero thou shalt be free
 as mountain winds but then exactly do
 all points of my command
ariel to the syllable
prospero come follow speak not for him
 exeunt
 the tempest
act ii
scene i another part of the island
 enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo
 adrian francisco and others
gonzalo beseech you sir be merry you have cause
 so have we all of joy for our escape
 is much beyond our loss our hint of woe
 is common every day some sailor's wife
 the masters of some merchant and the merchant
 have just our theme of woe but for the miracle
 i mean our preservation few in millions
 can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh
 our sorrow with our comfort
alonso prithee peace
sebastian he receives comfort like cold porridge
antonio the visitor will not give him o'er so
sebastian look he's winding up the watch of his wit
 by and by it will strike
gonzalo sir
sebastian one tell
gonzalo when every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd
 comes to the entertainer
sebastian a dollar
gonzalo dolour comes to him indeed you
 have spoken truer than you purposed
sebastian you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should
gonzalo therefore my lord
antonio fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
alonso i prithee spare
gonzalo well i have done but yet
sebastian he will be talking
antonio which of he or adrian for a good
 wager first begins to crow
sebastian the old cock
antonio the cockerel
sebastian done the wager
antonio a laughter
sebastian a match
adrian though this island seem to be desert
sebastian ha ha ha so you're paid
adrian uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
sebastian yet
adrian yet
antonio he could not miss't
adrian it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate
 temperance
antonio temperance was a delicate wench
sebastian ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
adrian the air breathes upon us here most sweetly
sebastian as if it had lungs and rotten ones
antonio or as twere perfumed by a fen
gonzalo here is everything advantageous to life
antonio true save means to live
sebastian of that there's none or little
gonzalo how lush and lusty the grass looks how green
antonio the ground indeed is tawny
sebastian with an eye of green in't
antonio he misses not much
sebastian no he doth but mistake the truth totally
gonzalo but the rarity of it iswhich is indeed almost
 beyond credit
sebastian as many vouched rarities are
gonzalo that our garments being as they were drenched in
 the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and
 glosses being rather newdyed than stained with
 salt water
antonio if but one of his pockets could speak would it not
 say he lies
sebastian ay or very falsely pocket up his report
gonzalo methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
 put them on first in afric at the marriage of
 the king's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis
sebastian twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
adrian tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
 their queen
gonzalo not since widow dido's time
antonio widow a pox o that how came that widow in
 widow dido
sebastian what if he had said widower aeneas too good lord
 how you take it
adrian widow dido said you you make me study of that
 she was of carthage not of tunis
gonzalo this tunis sir was carthage
adrian carthage
gonzalo i assure you carthage
sebastian his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath
 raised the wall and houses too
antonio what impossible matter will he make easy next
sebastian i think he will carry this island home in his pocket
 and give it his son for an apple
antonio and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring
 forth more islands
gonzalo ay
antonio why in good time
gonzalo sir we were talking that our garments seem now
 as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage
 of your daughter who is now queen
antonio and the rarest that e'er came there
sebastian bate i beseech you widow dido
antonio o widow dido ay widow dido
gonzalo is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i
 wore it i mean in a sort
antonio that sort was well fished for
gonzalo when i wore it at your daughter's marriage
alonso you cram these words into mine ears against
 the stomach of my sense would i had never
 married my daughter there for coming thence
 my son is lost and in my rate she too
 who is so far from italy removed
 i ne'er again shall see her o thou mine heir
 of naples and of milan what strange fish
 hath made his meal on thee
francisco sir he may live
 i saw him beat the surges under him
 and ride upon their backs he trod the water
 whose enmity he flung aside and breasted
 the surge most swoln that met him his bold head
 bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd
 himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
 to the shore that o'er his waveworn basis bow'd
 as stooping to relieve him i not doubt
 he came alive to land
alonso no no he's gone
sebastian sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
 that would not bless our europe with your daughter
 but rather lose her to an african
 where she at least is banish'd from your eye
 who hath cause to wet the grief on't
alonso prithee peace
sebastian you were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
 by all of us and the fair soul herself
 weigh'd between loathness and obedience at
 which end o the beam should bow we have lost your
 son
 i fear for ever milan and naples have
 more widows in them of this business making
 than we bring men to comfort them
 the fault's your own
alonso so is the dear'st o the loss
gonzalo my lord sebastian
 the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
 and time to speak it in you rub the sore
 when you should bring the plaster
sebastian very well
antonio and most chirurgeonly
gonzalo it is foul weather in us all good sir
 when you are cloudy
sebastian foul weather
antonio very foul
gonzalo had i plantation of this isle my lord
antonio he'ld sow't with nettleseed
sebastian or docks or mallows
gonzalo and were the king on't what would i do
sebastian scape being drunk for want of wine
gonzalo i the commonwealth i would by contraries
 execute all things for no kind of traffic
 would i admit no name of magistrate
 letters should not be known riches poverty
 and use of service none contract succession
 bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
 no use of metal corn or wine or oil
 no occupation all men idle all
 and women too but innocent and pure
 no sovereignty
sebastian yet he would be king on't
antonio the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
 beginning
gonzalo all things in common nature should produce
 without sweat or endeavour treason felony
 sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
 would i not have but nature should bring forth
 of its own kind all foison all abundance
 to feed my innocent people
sebastian no marrying mong his subjects
antonio none man all idle whores and knaves
gonzalo i would with such perfection govern sir
 to excel the golden age
sebastian god save his majesty
antonio long live gonzalo
gonzalo anddo you mark me sir
alonso prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me
gonzalo i do well believe your highness and
 did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen
 who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
 they always use to laugh at nothing
antonio twas you we laughed at
gonzalo who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
 to you so you may continue and laugh at
 nothing still
antonio what a blow was there given
sebastian an it had not fallen flatlong
gonzalo you are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift
 the moon out of her sphere if she would continue
 in it five weeks without changing
 enter ariel invisible playing solemn music
sebastian we would so and then go a batfowling
antonio nay good my lord be not angry
gonzalo no i warrant you i will not adventure
 my discretion so weakly will you laugh
 me asleep for i am very heavy
antonio go sleep and hear us
 all sleep except alonso sebastian and antonio
alonso what all so soon asleep i wish mine eyes
 would with themselves shut up my thoughts i find
 they are inclined to do so
sebastian please you sir
 do not omit the heavy offer of it
 it seldom visits sorrow when it doth
 it is a comforter
antonio we two my lord
 will guard your person while you take your rest
 and watch your safety
alonso thank you wondrous heavy
 alonso sleeps exit ariel
sebastian what a strange drowsiness possesses them
antonio it is the quality o the climate
sebastian why
 doth it not then our eyelids sink i find not
 myself disposed to sleep
antonio nor i my spirits are nimble
 they fell together all as by consent
 they dropp'd as by a thunderstroke what might
 worthy sebastian o what mightno more
 and yet me thinks i see it in thy face
 what thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee and
 my strong imagination sees a crown
 dropping upon thy head
sebastian what art thou waking
antonio do you not hear me speak
sebastian i do and surely
 it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
 out of thy sleep what is it thou didst say
 this is a strange repose to be asleep
 with eyes wide open standing speaking moving
 and yet so fast asleep
antonio noble sebastian
 thou let'st thy fortune sleepdie rather wink'st
 whiles thou art waking
sebastian thou dost snore distinctly
 there's meaning in thy snores
antonio i am more serious than my custom you
 must be so too if heed me which to do
 trebles thee o'er
sebastian well i am standing water
antonio i'll teach you how to flow
sebastian do so to ebb
 hereditary sloth instructs me
antonio o
 if you but knew how you the purpose cherish
 whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
 you more invest it ebbing men indeed
 most often do so near the bottom run
 by their own fear or sloth
sebastian prithee say on
 the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
 a matter from thee and a birth indeed
 which throes thee much to yield
antonio thus sir
 although this lord of weak remembrance this
 who shall be of as little memory
 when he is earth'd hath here almost persuade
 for he's a spirit of persuasion only
 professes to persuadethe king his son's alive
 tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
 and he that sleeps here swims
sebastian i have no hope
 that he's undrown'd
antonio o out of that no hope'
 what great hope have you no hope that way is
 another way so high a hope that even
 ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
 but doubt discovery there will you grant with me
 that ferdinand is drown'd
sebastian he's gone
antonio then tell me
 who's the next heir of naples
sebastian claribel
antonio she that is queen of tunis she that dwells
 ten leagues beyond man's life she that from naples
 can have no note unless the sun were post
 the man i the moon's too slowtill newborn chins
 be rough and razorable she thatfrom whom
 we all were seaswallow'd though some cast again
 and by that destiny to perform an act
 whereof what's past is prologue what to come
 in yours and my discharge
sebastian what stuff is this how say you
 tis true my brother's daughter's queen of tunis
 so is she heir of naples twixt which regions
 there is some space
antonio a space whose every cubit
 seems to cry out how shall that claribel
 measure us back to naples keep in tunis
 and let sebastian wake say this were death
 that now hath seized them why they were no worse
 than now they are there be that can rule naples
 as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
 as amply and unnecessarily
 as this gonzalo i myself could make
 a chough of as deep chat o that you bore
 the mind that i do what a sleep were this
 for your advancement do you understand me
sebastian methinks i do
antonio and how does your content
 tender your own good fortune
sebastian i remember
 you did supplant your brother prospero
antonio true
 and look how well my garments sit upon me
 much feater than before my brother's servants
 were then my fellows now they are my men
sebastian but for your conscience
antonio ay sir where lies that if twere a kibe
 twould put me to my slipper but i feel not
 this deity in my bosom twenty consciences
 that stand twixt me and milan candied be they
 and melt ere they molest here lies your brother
 no better than the earth he lies upon
 if he were that which now he's like that's dead
 whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it
 can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus
 to the perpetual wink for aye might put
 this ancient morsel this sir prudence who
 should not upbraid our course for all the rest
 they'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk
 they'll tell the clock to any business that
 we say befits the hour
sebastian thy case dear friend
 shall be my precedent as thou got'st milan
 i'll come by naples draw thy sword one stroke
 shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest
 and i the king shall love thee
antonio draw together
 and when i rear my hand do you the like
 to fall it on gonzalo
sebastian o but one word
 they talk apart
 reenter ariel invisible
ariel my master through his art foresees the danger
 that you his friend are in and sends me forth
 for else his project diesto keep them living
 sings in gonzalo's ear
 while you here do snoring lie
 openeyed conspiracy
 his time doth take
 if of life you keep a care
 shake off slumber and beware
 awake awake
antonio then let us both be sudden
gonzalo now good angels
 preserve the king
 they wake
alonso why how now ho awake why are you drawn
 wherefore this ghastly looking
gonzalo what's the matter
sebastian whiles we stood here securing your repose
 even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
 like bulls or rather lions did't not wake you
 it struck mine ear most terribly
alonso i heard nothing
antonio o twas a din to fright a monster's ear
 to make an earthquake sure it was the roar
 of a whole herd of lions
alonso heard you this gonzalo
gonzalo upon mine honour sir i heard a humming
 and that a strange one too which did awake me
 i shaked you sir and cried as mine eyes open'd
 i saw their weapons drawn there was a noise
 that's verily tis best we stand upon our guard
 or that we quit this place let's draw our weapons
alonso lead off this ground and let's make further search
 for my poor son
gonzalo heavens keep him from these beasts
 for he is sure i the island

act iii
scene i before prospero's cell
 enter ferdinand bearing a log
ferdinand there be some sports are painful and their labour
 delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness
 are nobly undergone and most poor matters
 point to rich ends this my mean task
 would be as heavy to me as odious but
 the mistress which i serve quickens what's dead
 and makes my labours pleasures o she is
 ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed
 and he's composed of harshness i must remove
 some thousands of these logs and pile them up
 upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress
 weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness
 had never like executor i forget
 but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
 most busy lest when i do it
 enter miranda and prospero at a distance unseen
miranda alas now pray you
 work not so hard i would the lightning had
 burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile
 pray set it down and rest you when this burns
 twill weep for having wearied you my father
 is hard at study pray now rest yourself
 he's safe for these three hours
ferdinand o most dear mistress
 the sun will set before i shall discharge
 what i must strive to do
miranda if you'll sit down
 i'll bear your logs the while pray give me that
 i'll carry it to the pile
ferdinand no precious creature
 i had rather crack my sinews break my back
 than you should such dishonour undergo
 while i sit lazy by
miranda it would become me
 as well as it does you and i should do it
 with much more ease for my good will is to it
 and yours it is against
prospero poor worm thou art infected
 this visitation shows it
miranda you look wearily
ferdinand no noble mistress'tis fresh morning with me
 when you are by at night i do beseech you
 chiefly that i might set it in my prayers
 what is your name
miranda mirandao my father
 i have broke your hest to say so
ferdinand admired miranda
 indeed the top of admiration worth
 what's dearest to the world full many a lady
 i have eyed with best regard and many a time
 the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
 brought my too diligent ear for several virtues
 have i liked several women never any
 with so fun soul but some defect in her
 did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
 and put it to the foil but you o you
 so perfect and so peerless are created
 of every creature's best
miranda i do not know
 one of my sex no woman's face remember
 save from my glass mine own nor have i seen
 more that i may call men than you good friend
 and my dear father how features are abroad
 i am skilless of but by my modesty
 the jewel in my dower i would not wish
 any companion in the world but you
 nor can imagination form a shape
 besides yourself to like of but i prattle
 something too wildly and my father's precepts
 i therein do forget
ferdinand i am in my condition
 a prince miranda i do think a king
 i would not soand would no more endure
 this wooden slavery than to suffer
 the fleshfly blow my mouth hear my soul speak
 the very instant that i saw you did
 my heart fly to your service there resides
 to make me slave to it and for your sake
 am i this patient logman
miranda do you love me
ferdinand o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound
 and crown what i profess with kind event
 if i speak true if hollowly invert
 what best is boded me to mischief i
 beyond all limit of what else i the world
 do love prize honour you
miranda i am a fool
 to weep at what i am glad of
prospero fair encounter
 of two most rare affections heavens rain grace
 on that which breeds between em
ferdinand wherefore weep you
miranda at mine unworthiness that dare not offer
 what i desire to give and much less take
 what i shall die to want but this is trifling
 and all the more it seeks to hide itself
 the bigger bulk it shows hence bashful cunning
 and prompt me plain and holy innocence
 i am your wife it you will marry me
 if not i'll die your maid to be your fellow
 you may deny me but i'll be your servant
 whether you will or no
ferdinand my mistress dearest
 and i thus humble ever
miranda my husband then
ferdinand ay with a heart as willing
 as bondage e'er of freedom here's my hand
miranda and mine with my heart in't and now farewell
 till half an hour hence
ferdinand a thousand thousand
 exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally
prospero so glad of this as they i cannot be
 who are surprised withal but my rejoicing
 at nothing can be more i'll to my book
 for yet ere suppertime must i perform
 much business appertaining

 one spirit to command they all do hate him
 as rootedly as i burn but his books
 he has brave utensilsfor so he calls them
 which when he has a house he'll deck withal
 and that most deeply to consider is
 the beauty of his daughter he himself
 calls her a nonpareil i never saw a woman

 but she as far surpasseth sycorax
 as great'st does least
stephano is it so brave a lass

 sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
 sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
 will hum about mine ears and sometime voices
 that if i then had waked after long sleep
 will make me sleep again and then in dreaming
 the clouds methought would open and show riches
 ready to drop upon me that when i waked
 i cried to dream again
stephano this will prove a brave kingdom to me where i shall
 have my music for nothing
caliban when prospero is destroyed
stephano that shall be by and by i remember the story

 adrian francisco and others
gonzalo by'r lakin i can go no further sir
 my old bones ache here's a maze trod indeed
 through forthrights and meanders by your patience
 i needs must rest me
alonso old lord i cannot blame thee
 who am myself attach'd with weariness
 to the dulling of my spirits sit down and rest
 even here i will put off my hope and keep it
 no longer for my flatterer he is drown'd
 whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks
 our frustrate search on land well let him go
antonio aside to sebastian i am right glad that he's so
 out of hope
 do not for one repulse forego the purpose
 that you resolved to effect
sebastian aside to antonio the next advantage
 will we take throughly
antonio aside to sebastian let it be tonight
 for now they are oppress'd with travel they
 will not nor cannot use such vigilance
 as when they are fresh
sebastian aside to antonio i say tonight no more
 solemn and strange music
alonso what harmony is this my good friends hark
gonzalo marvellous sweet music
 enter prospero above invisible enter several
 strange shapes bringing in a banquet
 they dance about it with gentle actions of
 salutation and inviting the king &c to
 eat they depart
alonso give us kind keepers heavens what were these
sebastian a living drollery now i will believe
 that there are unicorns that in arabia
 there is one tree the phoenix throne one phoenix
 at this hour reigning there
antonio i'll believe both
 and what does else want credit come to me
 and i'll be sworn tis true travellers ne'er did
 lie
 though fools at home condemn em
gonzalo if in naples
 i should report this now would they believe me
 if i should say i saw such islanders
 for certes these are people of the island
 who though they are of monstrous shape yet note
 their manners are more gentlekind than of
 our human generation you shall find
 many nay almost any
prospero aside honest lord
 thou hast said well for some of you there present
 are worse than devils
alonso i cannot too much muse
 such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing
 although they want the use of tongue a kind
 of excellent dumb discourse
prospero aside praise in departing
francisco they vanish'd strangely
sebastian no matter since
 they have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
 will't please you taste of what is here
alonso not i
gonzalo faith sir you need not fear when we were boys
 who would believe that there were mountaineers
 dewlapp'd like bulls whose throats had hanging at em
 wallets of flesh or that there were such men
 whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find
 each putterout of five for one will bring us
 good warrant of
alonso i will stand to and feed
 although my last no matter since i feel
 the best is past brother my lord the duke
 stand to and do as we
 thunder and lightning enter ariel like a
 harpy claps his wings upon the table and
 with a quaint device the banquet vanishes
ariel you are three men of sin whom destiny
 that hath to instrument this lower world
 and what is in't the neversurfeited sea
 hath caused to belch up you and on this island
 where man doth not inhabit you mongst men
 being most unfit to live i have made you mad
 and even with suchlike valour men hang and drown
 their proper selves
 alonso sebastian &c draw their swords
 you fools i and my fellows
 are ministers of fate the elements
 of whom your swords are temper'd may as well
 wound the loud winds or with bemock'dat stabs
 kill the stillclosing waters as diminish
 one dowle that's in my plume my fellowministers
 are like invulnerable if you could hurt
 your swords are now too massy for your strengths
 and will not be uplifted but remember
 for that's my business to youthat you three
 from milan did supplant good prospero
 exposed unto the sea which hath requit it
 him and his innocent child for which foul deed
 the powers delaying not forgetting have
 incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures
 against your peace thee of thy son alonso
 they have bereft and do pronounce by me
 lingering perdition worse than any death
 can be at once shall step by step attend
 you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from
 which here in this most desolate isle else falls
 upon your headsis nothing but heartsorrow
 and a clear life ensuing
 he vanishes in thunder then to soft music
 enter the shapes again and dance with
 mocks and mows and carrying out the table
prospero bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
 perform'd my ariel a grace it had devouring
 of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
 in what thou hadst to say so with good life
 and observation strange my meaner ministers
 their several kinds have done my high charms work
 and these mine enemies are all knit up
 in their distractions they now are in my power
 and in these fits i leave them while i visit
 young ferdinand whom they suppose is drown'd
 and his and mine loved darling
 exit above
gonzalo i the name of something holy sir why stand you
 in this strange stare
alonso o it is monstrous monstrous
 methought the billows spoke and told me of it
 the winds did sing it to me and the thunder
 that deep and dreadful organpipe pronounced
 the name of prosper it did bass my trespass
 therefore my son i the ooze is bedded and
 i'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
 and with him there lie mudded
 exit
sebastian but one fiend at a time
 i'll fight their legions o'er
antonio i'll be thy second
 exeunt sebastian and antonio
gonzalo all three of them are desperate their great guilt
 like poison given to work a great time after
 now gins to bite the spirits i do beseech you
 that are of suppler joints follow them swiftly
 and hinder them from what this ecstasy
 may now provoke them to
adrian follow i pray you
 exeunt

scene i before prospero's cell
 enter prospero ferdinand and miranda
prospero if i have too austerely punish'd you
 your compensation makes amends for i
 have given you here a third of mine own life
 or that for which i live who once again
 i tender to thy hand all thy vexations
 were but my trials of thy love and thou
 hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven
 i ratify this my rich gift o ferdinand
 do not smile at me that i boast her off
 for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
 and make it halt behind her
ferdinand i do believe it
 against an oracle
prospero then as my gift and thine own acquisition
 worthily purchased take my daughter but
 if thou dost break her virginknot before
 all sanctimonious ceremonies may
 with full and holy rite be minister'd
 no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
 to make this contract grow but barren hate
 soureyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
 the union of your bed with weeds so loathly
 that you shall hate it both therefore take heed
 as hymen's lamps shall light you
ferdinand as i hope
 for quiet days fair issue and long life
 with such love as tis now the murkiest den
 the most opportune place the strong'st suggestion
 our worser genius can shall never melt
 mine honour into lust to take away
 the edge of that day's celebration
 when i shall think or phoebus steeds are founder'd
 or night kept chain'd below
prospero fairly spoke
 sit then and talk with her she is thine own
 what ariel my industrious servant ariel

prospero thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
 did worthily perform and i must use you

 bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
 some vanity of mine art it is my promise
 and they expect it from me

 which spongy april at thy hest betrims
 to make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves
 whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves
 being lasslorn thy poleclipt vineyard
 and thy seamarge sterile and rockyhard

 rich scarf to my proud earth why hath thy queen
 summon'd me hither to this shortgrass'd green
iris a contract of true love to celebrate
 and some donation freely to estate
 on the blest lovers
ceres tell me heavenly bow
 if venus or her son as thou dost know
 do now attend the queen since they did plot
 the means that dusky dis my daughter got
 her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
 i have forsworn
iris of her society
 be not afraid i met her deity
 cutting the clouds towards paphos and her son
 dovedrawn with her here thought they to have done
 some wanton charm upon this man and maid
 whose vows are that no bedright shall be paid
 till hymen's torch be lighted but vain
 mars's hot minion is returned again

 swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
 and be a boy right out
ceres high'st queen of state
 great juno comes i know her by her gait
 enter juno
juno how does my bounteous sister go with me
 to bless this twain that they may prosperous be

 vines and clustering bunches growing
 plants with goodly burthen bowing
 spring come to you at the farthest
 in the very end of harvest

ferdinand this is a most majestic vision and
 harmoniously charmingly may i be bold
 to think these spirits
prospero spirits which by mine art
 i have from their confines call'd to enact
 my present fancies
ferdinand let me live here ever
 so rare a wonder'd father and a wife
 makes this place paradise
 juno and ceres whisper and send iris on
 employment
prospero sweet now silence
 juno and ceres whisper seriously
 there's something else to do hush and be mute
 or else our spell is marr'd
iris you nymphs call'd naiads of the windring brooks
 with your sedged crowns and everharmless looks
 leave your crisp channels and on this green land
 answer your summons juno does command
 come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate
 a contract of true love be not too late
 enter certain nymphs
 you sunburnt sicklemen of august weary
 come hither from the furrow and be merry
 make holiday your ryestraw hats put on
 and these fresh nymphs encounter every one
 in country footing
 enter certain reapers properly habited they
 join with the nymphs in a graceful dance
 towards the end whereof prospero starts
 suddenly and speaks after which to a
 strange hollow and confused noise they
 heavily vanish
prospero aside i had forgot that foul conspiracy
 of the beast caliban and his confederates
 against my life the minute of their plot
 is almost come
 to the spirits
 well done avoid no more
ferdinand this is strange your father's in some passion
 that works him strongly
miranda never till this day
 saw i him touch'd with anger so distemper'd
prospero you do look my son in a moved sort
 as if you were dismay'd be cheerful sir
 our revels now are ended these our actors
 as i foretold you were all spirits and
 are melted into air into thin air
 and like the baseless fabric of this vision
 the cloudcapp'd towers the gorgeous palaces
 the solemn temples the great globe itself
 ye all which it inherit shall dissolve
 and like this insubstantial pageant faded
 leave not a rack behind we are such stuff
 as dreams are made on and our little life
 is rounded with a sleep sir i am vex'd
 bear with my weakness my brain is troubled
 be not disturb'd with my infirmity
 if you be pleased retire into my cell
 and there repose a turn or two i'll walk
 to still my beating mind
ferdinand 
 we wish your peace
miranda 
 exeunt
prospero come with a thought i thank thee ariel come
 enter ariel
ariel thy thoughts i cleave to what's thy pleasure
prospero spirit
 we must prepare to meet with caliban
ariel ay my commander when i presented ceres
 i thought to have told thee of it but i fear'd
 lest i might anger thee
prospero say again where didst thou leave these varlets
ariel i told you sir they were redhot with drinking
 so fun of valour that they smote the air
 for breathing in their faces beat the ground
 for kissing of their feet yet always bending
 towards their project then i beat my tabour
 at which like unback'd colts they prick'd
 their ears
 advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses
 as they smelt music so i charm'd their ears
 that calflike they my lowing follow'd through
 tooth'd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns
 which entered their frail shins at last i left them
 i the filthymantled pool beyond your cell
 there dancing up to the chins that the foul lake
 o'erstunk their feet
prospero this was well done my bird
 thy shape invisible retain thou still
 the trumpery in my house go bring it hither
 for stale to catch these thieves
ariel i go i go
 exit

 nurture can never stick on whom my pains
 humanely taken all all lost quite lost
 and as with age his body uglier grows
 so his mind cankers i will plague them all
 even to roaring
 reenter ariel loaden with glistering apparel &c
 come hang them on this line
 prospero and ariel remain invisible enter

 monster but an infinite loss

 harmless fairy monster

stephano monster layto your fingers help to bear this
 away where my hogshead of wine is or i'll turn you
 out of my kingdom go to carry this
trinculo and this
stephano ay and this
 a noise of hunters heard enter divers spirits
 in shape of dogs and hounds and hunt them about
 prospero and ariel setting them on
prospero hey mountain hey
ariel silver i there it goes silver
prospero fury fury there tyrant there hark hark
 caliban stephano and trinculo are
 driven out
 go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
 with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews
 with aged cramps and more pinchspotted make them
 than pard or cat o mountain
ariel hark they roar
prospero let them be hunted soundly at this hour
 lie at my mercy all mine enemies
 shortly shall all my labours end and thou
 shalt have the air at freedom for a little
 follow and do me service
 exeunt
 the tempest
act v
scene i before prospero's cell
 enter prospero in his magic robes and ariel
prospero now does my project gather to a head
 my charms crack not my spirits obey and time
 goes upright with his carriage how's the day
ariel on the sixth hour at which time my lord
 you said our work should cease
prospero i did say so
 when first i raised the tempest say my spirit
 how fares the king and's followers
ariel confined together
 in the same fashion as you gave in charge
 just as you left them all prisoners sir
 in the linegrove which weatherfends your cell
 they cannot budge till your release the king
 his brother and yours abide all three distracted
 and the remainder mourning over them
 brimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
 him that you term'd sir the good old lord gonzalo'
 his tears run down his beard like winter's drops
 from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works em
 that if you now beheld them your affections
 would become tender
prospero dost thou think so spirit
ariel mine would sir were i human
prospero and mine shall
 hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling
 of their afflictions and shall not myself
 one of their kind that relish all as sharply
 passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art
 though with their high wrongs i am struck to the quick
 yet with my nobler reason gaitist my fury
 do i take part the rarer action is
 in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent
 the sole drift of my purpose doth extend
 not a frown further go release them ariel
 my charms i'll break their senses i'll restore
 and they shall be themselves
ariel i'll fetch them sir
 exit
prospero ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves
 and ye that on the sands with printless foot
 do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him
 when he comes back you demipuppets that
 by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
 whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime
 is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice
 to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid
 weak masters though ye be i have bedimm'd
 the noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds
 and twixt the green sea and the azured vault
 set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder
 have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak
 with his own bolt the strongbased promontory
 have i made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
 the pine and cedar graves at my command
 have waked their sleepers oped and let em forth
 by my so potent art but this rough magic
 i here abjure and when i have required
 some heavenly music which even now i do
 to work mine end upon their senses that
 this airy charm is for i'll break my staff
 bury it certain fathoms in the earth
 and deeper than did ever plummet sound
 i'll drown my book
 solemn music
 reenter ariel before then alonso with a
 frantic gesture attended by gonzalo
 sebastian and antonio in like manner
 attended by adrian and francisco they all
 enter the circle which prospero had made
 and there stand charmed which prospero
 observing speaks
 a solemn air and the best comforter
 to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
 now useless boil'd within thy skull there stand
 for you are spellstopp'd
 holy gonzalo honourable man
 mine eyes even sociable to the show of thine
 fall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apace
 and as the morning steals upon the night
 melting the darkness so their rising senses
 begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
 their clearer reason o good gonzalo
 my true preserver and a loyal sir
 to him you follow'st i will pay thy graces
 home both in word and deed most cruelly
 didst thou alonso use me and my daughter
 thy brother was a furtherer in the act
 thou art pinch'd fort now sebastian flesh and blood
 you brother mine that entertain'd ambition
 expell'd remorse and nature who with sebastian
 whose inward pinches therefore are most strong
 would here have kill'd your king i do forgive thee
 unnatural though thou art their understanding
 begins to swell and the approaching tide
 will shortly fill the reasonable shore
 that now lies foul and muddy not one of them
 that yet looks on me or would know me ariel
 fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell
 i will discase me and myself present
 as i was sometime milan quickly spirit
 thou shalt ere long be free
 ariel sings and helps to attire him
 where the bee sucks there suck i
 in a cowslip's bell i lie
 there i couch when owls do cry
 on the bat's back i do fly
 after summer merrily
 merrily merrily shall i live now
 under the blossom that hangs on the bough
prospero why that's my dainty ariel i shall miss thee
 but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so
 to the king's ship invisible as thou art
 there shalt thou find the mariners asleep
 under the hatches the master and the boatswain
 being awake enforce them to this place
 and presently i prithee
ariel i drink the air before me and return
 or ere your pulse twice beat
 exit
gonzalo all torment trouble wonder and amazement
 inhabits here some heavenly power guide us
 out of this fearful country
prospero behold sir king
 the wronged duke of milan prospero
 for more assurance that a living prince
 does now speak to thee i embrace thy body
 and to thee and thy company i bid
 a hearty welcome
alonso whether thou best he or no
 or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
 as late i have been i not know thy pulse
 beats as of flesh and blood and since i saw thee
 the affliction of my mind amends with which
 i fear a madness held me this must crave
 an if this be at all a most strange story
 thy dukedom i resign and do entreat
 thou pardon me my wrongs but how should prospero
 be living and be here
prospero first noble friend
 let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot
 be measured or confined
gonzalo whether this be
 or be not i'll not swear
prospero you do yet taste
 some subtilties o the isle that will not let you
 believe things certain welcome my friends all
 aside to sebastian and antonio
 but you my brace of lords were i so minded
 i here could pluck his highness frown upon you
 and justify you traitors at this time
 i will tell no tales
sebastian aside the devil speaks in him
prospero no
 for you most wicked sir whom to call brother
 would even infect my mouth i do forgive
 thy rankest fault all of them and require
 my dukedom of thee which perforce i know
 thou must restore
alonso if thou be'st prospero
 give us particulars of thy preservation
 how thou hast met us here who three hours since
 were wreck'd upon this shore where i have lost
 how sharp the point of this remembrance is
 my dear son ferdinand
prospero i am woe for't sir
alonso irreparable is the loss and patience
 says it is past her cure
prospero i rather think
 you have not sought her help of whose soft grace
 for the like loss i have her sovereign aid
 and rest myself content
alonso you the like loss
prospero as great to me as late and supportable
 to make the dear loss have i means much weaker
 than you may call to comfort you for i
 have lost my daughter
alonso a daughter
 o heavens that they were living both in naples
 the king and queen there that they were i wish
 myself were mudded in that oozy bed
 where my son lies when did you lose your daughter
prospero in this last tempest i perceive these lords
 at this encounter do so much admire
 that they devour their reason and scarce think
 their eyes do offices of truth their words
 are natural breath but howsoe'er you have
 been justled from your senses know for certain
 that i am prospero and that very duke
 which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely
 upon this shore where you were wreck'd was landed
 to be the lord on't no more yet of this
 for tis a chronicle of day by day
 not a relation for a breakfast nor
 befitting this first meeting welcome sir
 this cell's my court here have i few attendants
 and subjects none abroad pray you look in
 my dukedom since you have given me again
 i will requite you with as good a thing
 at least bring forth a wonder to content ye
 as much as me my dukedom
 here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda
 playing at chess
miranda sweet lord you play me false
ferdinand no my dear'st love
 i would not for the world
miranda yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
 and i would call it fair play
alonso if this prove
 a vision of the island one dear son
 shall i twice lose
sebastian a most high miracle
ferdinand though the seas threaten they are merciful
 i have cursed them without cause
 kneels
alonso now all the blessings
 of a glad father compass thee about
 arise and say how thou camest here
miranda o wonder
 how many goodly creatures are there here
 how beauteous mankind is o brave new world
 that has such people in't
prospero tis new to thee
alonso what is this maid with whom thou wast at play
 your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours
 is she the goddess that hath sever'd us
 and brought us thus together
ferdinand sir she is mortal
 but by immortal providence she's mine
 i chose her when i could not ask my father
 for his advice nor thought i had one she
 is daughter to this famous duke of milan
 of whom so often i have heard renown
 but never saw before of whom i have
 received a second life and second father
 this lady makes him to me
alonso i am hers
 but o how oddly will it sound that i
 must ask my child forgiveness
prospero there sir stop
 let us not burthen our remembrance with
 a heaviness that's gone
gonzalo i have inly wept
 or should have spoke ere this look down you god
 and on this couple drop a blessed crown
 for it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
 which brought us hither
alonso i say amen gonzalo
gonzalo was milan thrust from milan that his issue
 should become kings of naples o rejoice
 beyond a common joy and set it down
 with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage
 did claribel her husband find at tunis
 and ferdinand her brother found a wife
 where he himself was lost prospero his dukedom
 in a poor isle and all of us ourselves
 when no man was his own
alonso to ferdinand and miranda give me your hands
 let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
 that doth not wish you joy
gonzalo be it so amen
 reenter ariel with the master and boatswain
 amazedly following
 o look sir look sir here is more of us
 i prophesied if a gallows were on land
 this fellow could not drown now blasphemy
 that swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore
 hast thou no mouth by land what is the news
boatswain the best news is that we have safely found
 our king and company the next our ship
 which but three glasses since we gave out split
 is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
 we first put out to sea
ariel aside to prospero sir all this service
 have i done since i went
prospero aside to ariel my tricksy spirit
alonso these are not natural events they strengthen
 from strange to stranger say how came you hither
boatswain if i did think sir i were well awake
 i'ld strive to tell you we were dead of sleep
 andhow we know notall clapp'd under hatches
 where but even now with strange and several noises
 of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains
 and more diversity of sounds all horrible
 we were awaked straightway at liberty
 where we in all her trim freshly beheld
 our royal good and gallant ship our master
 capering to eye her on a trice so please you
 even in a dream were we divided from them
 and were brought moping hither
ariel aside to prospero was't well done
prospero aside to ariel bravely my diligence thou shalt be free
alonso this is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
 and there is in this business more than nature
 was ever conduct of some oracle
 must rectify our knowledge
prospero sir my liege
 do not infest your mind with beating on
 the strangeness of this business at pick'd leisure
 which shall be shortly single i'll resolve you
 which to you shall seem probable of every
 these happen'd accidents till when be cheerful
 and think of each thing well
 aside to ariel
 come hither spirit
 set caliban and his companions free
 untie the spell
 exit ariel
 how fares my gracious sir
 there are yet missing of your company
 some few odd lads that you remember not
 reenter ariel driving in caliban stephano
 and trinculo in their stolen apparel
stephano every man shift for all the rest and
 let no man take care for himself for all is
 but fortune coragio bullymonster coragio
trinculo if these be true spies which i wear in my head
 here's a goodly sight
caliban o setebos these be brave spirits indeed
 how fine my master is i am afraid
 he will chastise me
sebastian ha ha
 what things are these my lord antonio
 will money buy em
antonio very like one of them
 is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
prospero mark but the badges of these men my lords
 then say if they be true this misshapen knave
 his mother was a witch and one so strong
 that could control the moon make flows and ebbs
 and deal in her command without her power
 these three have robb'd me and this demidevil
 for he's a bastard onehad plotted with them
 to take my life two of these fellows you
 must know and own this thing of darkness
 acknowledge mine
caliban i shall be pinch'd to death
alonso is not this stephano my drunken butler
sebastian he is drunk now where had he wine
alonso and trinculo is reeling ripe where should they
 find this grand liquor that hath gilded em
 how camest thou in this pickle
trinculo i have been in such a pickle since i
 saw you last that i fear me will never out of
 my bones i shall not fear flyblowing
sebastian why how now stephano
stephano o touch me not i am not stephano but a cramp
prospero you'ld be king o the isle sirrah
stephano i should have been a sore one then
alonso this is a strange thing as e'er i look'd on
 pointing to caliban
prospero he is as disproportion'd in his manners
 as in his shape go sirrah to my cell
 take with you your companions as you look
 to have my pardon trim it handsomely
caliban ay that i will and i'll be wise hereafter
 and seek for grace what a thricedouble ass
 was i to take this drunkard for a god
 and worship this dull fool
prospero go to away
alonso hence and bestow your luggage where you found it
sebastian or stole it rather
 exeunt caliban stephano and trinculo
prospero sir i invite your highness and your train
 to my poor cell where you shall take your rest
 for this one night which part of it i'll waste
 with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it
 go quick away the story of my life
 and the particular accidents gone by
 since i came to this isle and in the morn
 i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples
 where i have hope to see the nuptial
 of these our dearbeloved solemnized
 and thence retire me to my milan where
 every third thought shall be my grave
alonso i long
 to hear the story of your life which must
 take the ear strangely
prospero i'll deliver all
 and promise you calm seas auspicious gales
 and sail so expeditious that shall catch
 your royal fleet far off
 aside to ariel
 my ariel chick
 that is thy charge then to the elements
 be free and fare thou well please you draw near
 exeunt
 the tempest
 epilogue
 spoken by prospero
 now my charms are all o'erthrown
 and what strength i have's mine own
 which is most faint now tis true
 i must be here confined by you
 or sent to naples let me not
 since i have my dukedom got
 and pardon'd the deceiver dwell
 in this bare island by your spell
 but release me from my bands
 with the help of your good hands
 gentle breath of yours my sails
 must fill or else my project fails
 which was to please now i want
 spirits to enforce art to enchant
 and my ending is despair
 unless i be relieved by prayer
 which pierces so that it assaults
 mercy itself and frees all faults
 as you from crimes would pardon'd be
 let your indulgence set me free

 troilus and cressida
 prologue
 in troy there lies the scene from isles of greece
 the princes orgulous their high blood chafed
 have to the port of athens sent their ships
 fraught with the ministers and instruments
 of cruel war sixty and nine that wore
 their crownets regal from the athenian bay
 put forth toward phrygia and their vow is made
 to ransack troy within whose strong immures
 the ravish'd helen menelaus queen
 with wanton paris sleeps and that's the quarrel
 to tenedos they come
 and the deepdrawing barks do there disgorge
 their warlike fraughtage now on dardan plains
 the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch
 their brave pavilions priam's sixgated city
 dardan and tymbria helias chetas troien
 and antenorides with massy staples
 and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
 sperr up the sons of troy
 now expectation tickling skittish spirits
 on one and other side trojan and greek
 sets all on hazard and hither am i come
 a prologue arm'd but not in confidence
 of author's pen or actor's voice but suited
 in like conditions as our argument
 to tell you fair beholders that our play
 leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils
 beginning in the middle starting thence away
 to what may be digested in a play
 like or find fault do as your pleasures are
 now good or bad tis but the chance of war
 troilus and cressida
act i
scene i troy before priam's palace
 enter troilus armed and pandarus
troilus call here my varlet i'll unarm again
 why should i war without the walls of troy
 that find such cruel battle here within
 each trojan that is master of his heart
 let him to field troilus alas hath none
pandarus will this gear ne'er be mended
troilus the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
 fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
 but i am weaker than a woman's tear
 tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance
 less valiant than the virgin in the night
 and skilless as unpractised infancy
pandarus well i have told you enough of this for my part
 i'll not meddle nor make no further he that will
 have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding
troilus have i not tarried
pandarus ay the grinding but you must tarry
 the bolting
troilus have i not tarried
pandarus ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening
troilus still have i tarried
pandarus ay to the leavening but here's yet in the word
 hereafter the kneading the making of the cake the
 heating of the oven and the baking nay you must
 stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lips
troilus patience herself what goddess e'er she be
 doth lesser blench at sufferance than i do
 at priam's royal table do i sit
 and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts
 so traitor when she comes when is she thence
pandarus well she looked yesternight fairer than ever i saw
 her look or any woman else
troilus i was about to tell theewhen my heart
 as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain
 lest hector or my father should perceive me
 i have as when the sun doth light a storm
 buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
 but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
 is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness
pandarus an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen's
 well go tothere were no more comparison between
 the women but for my part she is my kinswoman i
 would not as they term it praise her but i would
 somebody had heard her talk yesterday as i did i
 will not dispraise your sister cassandra's wit but
troilus o pandarus i tell thee pandarus
 when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd
 reply not in how many fathoms deep
 they lie indrench'd i tell thee i am mad
 in cressid's love thou answer'st she is fair'
 pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
 her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice
 handlest in thy discourse o that her hand
 in whose comparison all whites are ink
 writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure
 the cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
 hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tell'st me
 as true thou tell'st me when i say i love her
 but saying thus instead of oil and balm
 thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
 the knife that made it
pandarus i speak no more than truth
troilus thou dost not speak so much
pandarus faith i'll not meddle in't let her be as she is
 if she be fair tis the better for her an she be
 not she has the mends in her own hands
troilus good pandarus how now pandarus
pandarus i have had my labour for my travail illthought on of
 her and illthought on of you gone between and
 between but small thanks for my labour
troilus what art thou angry pandarus what with me
pandarus because she's kin to me therefore she's not so fair
 as helen an she were not kin to me she would be as
 fair on friday as helen is on sunday but what care
 i i care not an she were a blackamoor tis all one to me
troilus say i she is not fair
pandarus i do not care whether you do or no she's a fool to
 stay behind her father let her to the greeks and so
 i'll tell her the next time i see her for my part
 i'll meddle nor make no more i the matter
troilus pandarus
pandarus not i
troilus sweet pandarus
pandarus pray you speak no more to me i will leave all as i
 found it and there an end
 exit pandarus an alarum
troilus peace you ungracious clamours peace rude sounds
 fools on both sides helen must needs be fair
 when with your blood you daily paint her thus
 i cannot fight upon this argument
 it is too starved a subject for my sword
 but pandaruso gods how do you plague me
 i cannot come to cressid but by pandar
 and he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
 as she is stubbornchaste against all suit
 tell me apollo for thy daphne's love
 what cressid is what pandar and what we
 her bed is india there she lies a pearl
 between our ilium and where she resides
 let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood
 ourself the merchant and this sailing pandar
 our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark
 alarum enter aeneas
aeneas how now prince troilus wherefore not afield
troilus because not there this woman's answer sorts
 for womanish it is to be from thence
 what news aeneas from the field today
aeneas that paris is returned home and hurt
troilus by whom aeneas
aeneas troilus by menelaus
troilus let paris bleed tis but a scar to scorn
 paris is gored with menelaus horn
 alarum
aeneas hark what good sport is out of town today
troilus better at home if would i might were may'
 but to the sport abroad are you bound thither
aeneas in all swift haste
troilus come go we then together

 troilus and cressida
act i
scene ii the same a street
 enter cressida and alexander
cressida who were those went by
alexander queen hecuba and helen
cressida and whither go they
alexander up to the eastern tower
 whose height commands as subject all the vale
 to see the battle hector whose patience
 is as a virtue fix'd today was moved
 he chid andromache and struck his armourer
 and like as there were husbandry in war
 before the sun rose he was harness'd light
 and to the field goes he where every flower
 did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
 in hector's wrath
cressida what was his cause of anger
alexander the noise goes this there is among the greeks
 a lord of trojan blood nephew to hector
 they call him ajax
cressida good and what of him
alexander they say he is a very man per se
 and stands alone
cressida so do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs
alexander this man lady hath robbed many beasts of their
 particular additions he is as valiant as the lion
 churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man
 into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
 valour is crushed into folly his folly sauced with
 discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he
 hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he
 carries some stain of it he is melancholy without
 cause and merry against the hair he hath the
 joints of every thing but everything so out of joint
 that he is a gouty briareus many hands and no use
 or purblind argus all eyes and no sight
cressida but how should this man that makes
 me smile make hector angry
alexander they say he yesterday coped hector in the battle and
 struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath
 ever since kept hector fasting and waking
cressida who comes here
alexander madam your uncle pandarus
 enter pandarus
cressida hector's a gallant man
alexander as may be in the world lady
pandarus what's that what's that
cressida good morrow uncle pandarus
pandarus good morrow cousin cressid what do you talk of
 good morrow alexander how do you cousin when
 were you at ilium
cressida this morning uncle
pandarus what were you talking of when i came was hector
 armed and gone ere ye came to ilium helen was not
 up was she
cressida hector was gone but helen was not up
pandarus even so hector was stirring early
cressida that were we talking of and of his anger
pandarus was he angry
cressida so he says here
pandarus true he was so i know the cause too he'll lay
 about him today i can tell them that and there's
 troilus will not come far behind him let them take
 heed of troilus i can tell them that too
cressida what is he angry too
pandarus who troilus troilus is the better man of the two
cressida o jupiter there's no comparison
pandarus what not between troilus and hector do you know a
 man if you see him
cressida ay if i ever saw him before and knew him
pandarus well i say troilus is troilus
cressida then you say as i say for i am sure he is not hector
pandarus no nor hector is not troilus in some degrees
cressida tis just to each of them he is himself
pandarus himself alas poor troilus i would he were
cressida so he is
pandarus condition i had gone barefoot to india
cressida he is not hector
pandarus himself no he's not himself would a were
 himself well the gods are above time must friend
 or end well troilus well i would my heart were
 in her body no hector is not a better man than troilus
cressida excuse me
pandarus he is elder
cressida pardon me pardon me
pandarus th other's not come to't you shall tell me another
 tale when th other's come to't hector shall not
 have his wit this year
cressida he shall not need it if he have his own
pandarus nor his qualities
cressida no matter
pandarus nor his beauty
cressida twould not become him his own's better
pandarus you have no judgment niece helen
 herself swore th other day that troilus for
 a brown favourfor so tis i must confess
 not brown neither
cressida no but brown
pandarus faith to say truth brown and not brown
cressida to say the truth true and not true
pandarus she praised his complexion above paris
cressida why paris hath colour enough
pandarus so he has
cressida then troilus should have too much if she praised
 him above his complexion is higher than his he
 having colour enough and the other higher is too
 flaming a praise for a good complexion i had as
 lief helen's golden tongue had commended troilus for
 a copper nose
pandarus i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris
cressida then she's a merry greek indeed
pandarus nay i am sure she does she came to him th other
 day into the compassed windowand you know he
 has not past three or four hairs on his chin
cressida indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
 particulars therein to a total
pandarus why he is very young and yet will he within
 three pound lift as much as his brother hector
cressida is he so young a man and so old a lifter
pandarus but to prove to you that helen loves him she came
 and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin
cressida juno have mercy how came it cloven
pandarus why you know tis dimpled i think his smiling
 becomes him better than any man in all phrygia
cressida o he smiles valiantly
pandarus does he not
cressida o yes an twere a cloud in autumn
pandarus why go to then but to prove to you that helen
 loves troilus
cressida troilus will stand to the proof if you'll
 prove it so
pandarus troilus why he esteems her no more than i esteem
 an addle egg
cressida if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
 head you would eat chickens i the shell
pandarus i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled
 his chin indeed she has a marvellous white hand i
 must needs confess
cressida without the rack
pandarus and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin
cressida alas poor chin many a wart is richer
pandarus but there was such laughing queen hecuba laughed
 that her eyes ran o'er
cressida with millstones
pandarus and cassandra laughed
cressida but there was more temperate fire under the pot of
 her eyes did her eyes run o'er too
pandarus and hector laughed
cressida at what was all this laughing
pandarus marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus chin
cressida an't had been a green hair i should have laughed
 too
pandarus they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer
cressida what was his answer
pandarus quoth she here's but two and fifty hairs on your
 chin and one of them is white
cressida this is her question
pandarus that's true make no question of that two and
 fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white
 hair is my father and all the rest are his sons'
 jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is paris
 my husband the forked one quoth he pluck't
 out and give it him but there was such laughing
 and helen so blushed an paris so chafed and all the
 rest so laughed that it passed
cressida so let it now for it has been while going by
pandarus well cousin i told you a thing yesterday think on't
cressida so i do
pandarus i'll be sworn tis true he will weep you an twere
 a man born in april
cressida and i'll spring up in his tears an twere a nettle
 against may
 a retreat sounded

 heart good yonder comes paris yonder comes paris

 his helm more hacked than hector's and how he looks
 and how he goes o admirable youth he ne'er saw
 three and twenty go thy way troilus go thy way
 had i a sister were a grace or a daughter a goddess
 he should take his choice o admirable man paris
 paris is dirt to him and i warrant helen to
 change would give an eye to boot
cressida here come more
 forces pass
pandarus asses fools dolts chaff and bran chaff and bran
 porridge after meat i could live and die i the
 eyes of troilus ne'er look ne'er look the eagles
 are gone crows and daws crows and daws i had
 rather be such a man as troilus than agamemnon and
 all greece
cressida there is among the greeks achilles a better man than troilus
pandarus achilles a drayman a porter a very camel
cressida well well
pandarus well well why have you any discretion have
 you any eyes do you know what a man is is not
 birth beauty good shape discourse manhood
 learning gentleness virtue youth liberality
 and such like the spice and salt that season a man
cressida ay a minced man and then to be baked with no date
 in the pie for then the man's date's out
pandarus you are such a woman one knows not at what ward you
 lie
cressida upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to
 defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine
 honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to
 defend all these and at all these wards i lie at a
 thousand watches
pandarus say one of your watches
cressida nay i'll watch you for that and that's one of the
 chiefest of them too if i cannot ward what i would
 not have hit i can watch you for telling how i took
 the blow unless it swell past hiding and then it's
 past watching
pandarus you are such another
 enter troilus's boy
boy sir my lord would instantly speak with you
pandarus where
boy at your own house there he unarms him
pandarus good boy tell him i come
 exit boy
 i doubt he be hurt fare ye well good niece
cressida adieu uncle
pandarus i'll be with you niece by and by
cressida to bring uncle
pandarus ay a token from troilus
cressida by the same token you are a bawd
 exit pandarus
 words vows gifts tears and love's full sacrifice
 he offers in another's enterprise
 but more in troilus thousand fold i see
 than in the glass of pandar's praise may be
 yet hold i off women are angels wooing
 things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing
 that she beloved knows nought that knows not this
 men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is
 that she was never yet that ever knew
 love got so sweet as when desire did sue
 therefore this maxim out of love i teach
 achievement is command ungain'd beseech
 then though my heart's content firm love doth bear
 nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear

act i
scene iii the grecian camp before agamemnon's tent
 sennet enter agamemnon nestor ulysses
 menelaus and others
agamemnon princes
 what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks
 the ample proposition that hope makes
 in all designs begun on earth below
 fails in the promised largeness cheques and disasters
 grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd
 as knots by the conflux of meeting sap
 infect the sound pine and divert his grain
 tortive and errant from his course of growth
 nor princes is it matter new to us
 that we come short of our suppose so far
 that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand
 sith every action that hath gone before
 whereof we have record trial did draw
 bias and thwart not answering the aim
 and that unbodied figure of the thought
 that gave't surmised shape why then you princes
 do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works
 and call them shames which are indeed nought else
 but the protractive trials of great jove
 to find persistive constancy in men
 the fineness of which metal is not found
 in fortune's love for then the bold and coward
 the wise and fool the artist and unread
 the hard and soft seem all affined and kin
 but in the wind and tempest of her frown
 distinction with a broad and powerful fan
 puffing at all winnows the light away
 and what hath mass or matter by itself
 lies rich in virtue and unmingled
nestor with due observance of thy godlike seat
 great agamemnon nestor shall apply
 thy latest words in the reproof of chance
 lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth
 how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
 upon her patient breast making their way
 with those of nobler bulk
 but let the ruffian boreas once enrage
 the gentle thetis and anon behold
 the strongribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut
 bounding between the two moist elements
 like perseus horse where's then the saucy boat
 whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
 corivall'd greatness either to harbour fled
 or made a toast for neptune even so
 doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
 in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness
 the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
 than by the tiger but when the splitting wind
 makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
 and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage
 as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize
 and with an accent tuned in selfsame key
 retorts to chiding fortune
ulysses agamemnon
 thou great commander nerve and bone of greece
 heart of our numbers soul and only spirit
 in whom the tempers and the minds of all
 should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks
 besides the applause and approbation to which
 to agamemnon
 most mighty for thy place and sway
 to nestor
 and thou most reverend for thy stretch'dout life
 i give to both your speeches which were such
 as agamemnon and the hand of greece
 should hold up high in brass and such again
 as venerable nestor hatch'd in silver
 should with a bond of air strong as the axletree
 on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears
 to his experienced tongue yet let it please both
 thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak
agamemnon speak prince of ithaca and be't of less expect
 that matter needless of importless burden
 divide thy lips than we are confident
 when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws
 we shall hear music wit and oracle
ulysses troy yet upon his basis had been down
 and the great hector's sword had lack'd a master
 but for these instances
 the specialty of rule hath been neglected
 and look how many grecian tents do stand
 hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions
 when that the general is not like the hive
 to whom the foragers shall all repair
 what honey is expected degree being vizarded
 the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask
 the heavens themselves the planets and this centre
 observe degree priority and place
 insisture course proportion season form
 office and custom in all line of order
 and therefore is the glorious planet sol
 in noble eminence enthroned and sphered
 amidst the other whose medicinable eye
 corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
 and posts like the commandment of a king
 sans cheque to good and bad but when the planets
 in evil mixture to disorder wander
 what plagues and what portents what mutiny
 what raging of the sea shaking of earth
 commotion in the winds frights changes horrors
 divert and crack rend and deracinate
 the unity and married calm of states
 quite from their fixure o when degree is shaked
 which is the ladder to all high designs
 then enterprise is sick how could communities
 degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities
 peaceful commerce from dividable shores
 the primogenitive and due of birth
 prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels
 but by degree stand in authentic place
 take but degree away untune that string
 and hark what discord follows each thing meets
 in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters
 should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
 and make a sop of all this solid globe
 strength should be lord of imbecility
 and the rude son should strike his father dead
 force should be right or rather right and wrong
 between whose endless jar justice resides
 should lose their names and so should justice too
 then every thing includes itself in power
 power into will will into appetite
 and appetite an universal wolf
 so doubly seconded with will and power
 must make perforce an universal prey
 and last eat up himself great agamemnon
 this chaos when degree is suffocate
 follows the choking
 and this neglection of degree it is
 that by a pace goes backward with a purpose
 it hath to climb the general's disdain'd
 by him one step below he by the next
 that next by him beneath so every step
 exampled by the first pace that is sick
 of his superior grows to an envious fever
 of pale and bloodless emulation
 and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot
 not her own sinews to end a tale of length
 troy in our weakness stands not in her strength
nestor most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
 the fever whereof all our power is sick
agamemnon the nature of the sickness found ulysses
 what is the remedy
ulysses the great achilles whom opinion crowns
 the sinew and the forehand of our host
 having his ear full of his airy fame
 grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
 lies mocking our designs with him patroclus
 upon a lazy bed the livelong day
 breaks scurril jests
 and with ridiculous and awkward action
 which slanderer he imitation calls
 he pageants us sometime great agamemnon
 thy topless deputation he puts on
 and like a strutting player whose conceit
 lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
 to hear the wooden dialogue and sound
 twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage
 such tobepitied and o'erwrested seeming
 he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks
 tis like a chime amending with terms unsquared
 which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp'd
 would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff
 the large achilles on his press'd bed lolling
 from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
 cries excellent tis agamemnon just
 now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard
 as he being drest to some oration'
 that's done as near as the extremest ends
 of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife
 yet god achilles still cries excellent
 tis nestor right now play him me patroclus
 arming to answer in a night alarm'
 and then forsooth the faint defects of age
 must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit
 and with a palsyfumbling on his gorget
 shake in and out the rivet and at this sport
 sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus
 or give me ribs of steel i shall split all
 in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion
 all our abilities gifts natures shapes
 severals and generals of grace exact
 achievements plots orders preventions
 excitements to the field or speech for truce
 success or loss what is or is not serves
 as stuff for these two to make paradoxes
nestor and in the imitation of these twain
 who as ulysses says opinion crowns
 with an imperial voicemany are infect
 ajax is grown selfwill'd and bears his head
 in such a rein in full as proud a place
 as broad achilles keeps his tent like him
 makes factious feasts rails on our state of war
 bold as an oracle and sets thersites
 a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
 to match us in comparisons with dirt
 to weaken and discredit our exposure
 how rank soever rounded in with danger
ulysses they tax our policy and call it cowardice
 count wisdom as no member of the war
 forestall prescience and esteem no act
 but that of hand the still and mental parts
 that do contrive how many hands shall strike
 when fitness calls them on and know by measure
 of their observant toil the enemies weight
 why this hath not a finger's dignity
 they call this bedwork mappery closetwar
 so that the ram that batters down the wall
 for the great swing and rudeness of his poise
 they place before his hand that made the engine
 or those that with the fineness of their souls
 by reason guide his execution
nestor let this be granted and achilles horse
 makes many thetis sons
 a tucket
agamemnon what trumpet look menelaus
menelaus from troy
 enter aeneas
agamemnon what would you fore our tent
aeneas is this great agamemnon's tent i pray you
agamemnon even this
aeneas may one that is a herald and a prince
 do a fair message to his kingly ears
agamemnon with surety stronger than achilles arm
 fore all the greekish heads which with one voice
 call agamemnon head and general
aeneas fair leave and large security how may
 a stranger to those most imperial looks
 know them from eyes of other mortals
agamemnon how
aeneas ay
 i ask that i might waken reverence
 and bid the cheek be ready with a blush
 modest as morning when she coldly eyes
 the youthful phoebus
 which is that god in office guiding men
 which is the high and mighty agamemnon
agamemnon this trojan scorns us or the men of troy
 are ceremonious courtiers
aeneas courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd
 as bending angels that's their fame in peace
 but when they would seem soldiers they have galls
 good arms strong joints true swords and
 jove's accord
 nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas
 peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lips
 the worthiness of praise distains his worth
 if that the praised himself bring the praise forth
 but what the repining enemy commends
 that breath fame blows that praise sole sure
 transcends
agamemnon sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas
aeneas ay greek that is my name
agamemnon what's your affair i pray you
aeneas sir pardon tis for agamemnon's ears
agamemnon he hears naught privately that comes from troy
aeneas nor i from troy come not to whisper him
 i bring a trumpet to awake his ear
 to set his sense on the attentive bent
 and then to speak
agamemnon speak frankly as the wind
 it is not agamemnon's sleeping hour
 that thou shalt know trojan he is awake
 he tells thee so himself
aeneas trumpet blow loud
 send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
 and every greek of mettle let him know
 what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud
 trumpet sounds
 we have great agamemnon here in troy
 a prince call'd hectorpriam is his father
 who in this dull and longcontinued truce
 is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet
 and to this purpose speak kings princes lords
 if there be one among the fair'st of greece
 that holds his honour higher than his ease
 that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
 that knows his valour and knows not his fear
 that loves his mistress more than in confession
 with truant vows to her own lips he loves
 and dare avow her beauty and her worth
 in other arms than hersto him this challenge
 hector in view of trojans and of greeks
 shall make it good or do his best to do it
 he hath a lady wiser fairer truer
 than ever greek did compass in his arms
 and will tomorrow with his trumpet call
 midway between your tents and walls of troy
 to rouse a grecian that is true in love
 if any come hector shall honour him
 if none he'll say in troy when he retires
 the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
 the splinter of a lance even so much
agamemnon this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas
 if none of them have soul in such a kind
 we left them all at home but we are soldiers
 and may that soldier a mere recreant prove
 that means not hath not or is not in love
 if then one is or hath or means to be
 that one meets hector if none else i am he
nestor tell him of nestor one that was a man
 when hector's grandsire suck'd he is old now
 but if there be not in our grecian host
 one noble man that hath one spark of fire
 to answer for his love tell him from me
 i'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
 and in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn
 and meeting him will tell him that my lady
 was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
 as may be in the world his youth in flood
 i'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood
aeneas now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth
ulysses amen
agamemnon fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand
 to our pavilion shall i lead you sir
 achilles shall have word of this intent
 so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent
 yourself shall feast with us before you go
 and find the welcome of a noble foe
 exeunt all but ulysses and nestor
ulysses nestor
nestor what says ulysses
ulysses i have a young conception in my brain
 be you my time to bring it to some shape
nestor what is't
ulysses this tis
 blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride
 that hath to this maturity blown up
 in rank achilles must or now be cropp'd
 or shedding breed a nursery of like evil
 to overbulk us all
nestor well and how
ulysses this challenge that the gallant hector sends
 however it is spread in general name
 relates in purpose only to achilles
nestor the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
 whose grossness little characters sum up
 and in the publication make no strain
 but that achilles were his brain as barren
 as banks of libyathough apollo knows
 tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment
 ay with celerity find hector's purpose
 pointing on him
ulysses and wake him to the answer think you
nestor yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose
 that can from hector bring his honour off
 if not achilles though't be a sportful combat
 yet in the trial much opinion dwells
 for here the trojans taste our dear'st repute
 with their finest palate and trust to me ulysses
 our imputation shall be oddly poised
 in this wild action for the success
 although particular shall give a scantling
 of good or bad unto the general
 and in such indexes although small pricks
 to their subsequent volumes there is seen
 the baby figure of the giant mass
 of things to come at large it is supposed
 he that meets hector issues from our choice
 and choice being mutual act of all our souls
 makes merit her election and doth boil
 as twere from us all a man distill'd
 out of our virtues who miscarrying
 what heart receives from hence the conquering part
 to steel a strong opinion to themselves
 which entertain'd limbs are his instruments
 in no less working than are swords and bows
 directive by the limbs
ulysses give pardon to my speech
 therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector
 let us like merchants show our foulest wares
 and think perchance they'll sell if not
 the lustre of the better yet to show
 shall show the better do not consent
 that ever hector and achilles meet
 for both our honour and our shame in this
 are dogg'd with two strange followers
nestor i see them not with my old eyes what are they
ulysses what glory our achilles shares from hector
 were he not proud we all should share with him
 but he already is too insolent
 and we were better parch in afric sun
 than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
 should he scape hector fair if he were foil'd
 why then we did our main opinion crush
 in taint of our best man no make a lottery
 and by device let blockish ajax draw
 the sort to fight with hector among ourselves
 give him allowance for the better man
 for that will physic the great myrmidon
 who broils in loud applause and make him fall
 his crest that prouder than blue iris bends
 if the dull brainless ajax come safe off
 we'll dress him up in voices if he fail
 yet go we under our opinion still
 that we have better men but hit or miss
 our project's life this shape of sense assumes
 ajax employ'd plucks down achilles plumes
nestor ulysses
 now i begin to relish thy advice
 and i will give a taste of it forthwith
 to agamemnon go we to him straight
 two curs shall tame each other pride alone
 must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone

 troilus and cressida
act ii
scene ii troy a room in priam's palace
 enter priam hector troilus paris and helenus
priam after so many hours lives speeches spent
 thus once again says nestor from the greeks
 deliver helen and all damage else
 as honour loss of time travail expense
 wounds friends and what else dear that is consumed
 in hot digestion of this cormorant war
 shall be struck off hector what say you to't
hector though no man lesser fears the greeks than i
 as far as toucheth my particular
 yet dread priam
 there is no lady of more softer bowels
 more spongy to suck in the sense of fear
 more ready to cry out who knows what follows'
 than hector is the wound of peace is surety
 surety secure but modest doubt is call'd
 the beacon of the wise the tent that searches
 to the bottom of the worst let helen go
 since the first sword was drawn about this question
 every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes
 hath been as dear as helen i mean of ours
 if we have lost so many tenths of ours
 to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
 had it our name the value of one ten
 what merit's in that reason which denies
 the yielding of her up
troilus fie fie my brother
 weigh you the worth and honour of a king
 so great as our dread father in a scale
 of common ounces will you with counters sum
 the past proportion of his infinite
 and buckle in a waist most fathomless
 with spans and inches so diminutive
 as fears and reasons fie for godly shame
helenus no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
 you are so empty of them should not our father
 bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
 because your speech hath none that tells him so
troilus you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
 you fur your gloves with reason here are
 your reasons
 you know an enemy intends you harm
 you know a sword employ'd is perilous
 and reason flies the object of all harm
 who marvels then when helenus beholds
 a grecian and his sword if he do set
 the very wings of reason to his heels
 and fly like chidden mercury from jove
 or like a star disorb'd nay if we talk of reason
 let's shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour
 should have harehearts would they but fat
 their thoughts
 with this cramm'd reason reason and respect
 make livers pale and lustihood deject
hector brother she is not worth what she doth cost
 the holding
troilus what is aught but as tis valued
hector but value dwells not in particular will
 it holds his estimate and dignity
 as well wherein tis precious of itself
 as in the prizer tis mad idolatry
 to make the service greater than the god
 and the will dotes that is attributive
 to what infectiously itself affects
 without some image of the affected merit
troilus i take today a wife and my election
 is led on in the conduct of my will
 my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
 two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores
 of will and judgment how may i avoid
 although my will distaste what it elected
 the wife i chose there can be no evasion
 to blench from this and to stand firm by honour
 we turn not back the silks upon the merchant
 when we have soil'd them nor the remainder viands
 we do not throw in unrespective sieve
 because we now are full it was thought meet
 paris should do some vengeance on the greeks
 your breath of full consent bellied his sails
 the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce
 and did him service he touch'd the ports desired
 and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive
 he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness
 wrinkles apollo's and makes stale the morning
 why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt
 is she worth keeping why she is a pearl
 whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships
 and turn'd crown'd kings to merchants
 if you'll avouch twas wisdom paris went
 as you must needs for you all cried go go'
 if you'll confess he brought home noble prize
 as you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands
 and cried inestimable'why do you now
 the issue of your proper wisdoms rate
 and do a deed that fortune never did
 beggar the estimation which you prized
 richer than sea and land o theft most base
 that we have stol'n what we do fear to keep
 but thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n
 that in their country did them that disgrace
 we fear to warrant in our native place
cassandra within cry trojans cry
priam what noise what shriek is this
troilus tis our mad sister i do know her voice
cassandra within cry trojans
hector it is cassandra
 enter cassandra raving
cassandra cry trojans cry lend me ten thousand eyes
 and i will fill them with prophetic tears
hector peace sister peace
cassandra virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld
 soft infancy that nothing canst but cry
 add to my clamours let us pay betimes
 a moiety of that mass of moan to come
 cry trojans cry practise your eyes with tears
 troy must not be nor goodly ilion stand
 our firebrand brother paris burns us all
 cry trojans cry a helen and a woe
 cry cry troy burns or else let helen go
 exit
hector now youthful troilus do not these high strains
 of divination in our sister work
 some touches of remorse or is your blood
 so madly hot that no discourse of reason
 nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
 can qualify the same
troilus why brother hector
 we may not think the justness of each act
 such and no other than event doth form it
 nor once deject the courage of our minds
 because cassandra's mad her brainsick raptures
 cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
 which hath our several honours all engaged
 to make it gracious for my private part
 i am no more touch'd than all priam's sons
 and jove forbid there should be done amongst us
 such things as might offend the weakest spleen
 to fight for and maintain
paris else might the world convince of levity
 as well my undertakings as your counsels
 but i attest the gods your full consent
 gave wings to my propension and cut off
 all fears attending on so dire a project
 for what alas can these my single arms
 what propugnation is in one man's valour
 to stand the push and enmity of those
 this quarrel would excite yet i protest
 were i alone to pass the difficulties
 and had as ample power as i have will
 paris should ne'er retract what he hath done
 nor faint in the pursuit
priam paris you speak
 like one besotted on your sweet delights
 you have the honey still but these the gall
 so to be valiant is no praise at all
paris sir i propose not merely to myself
 the pleasures such a beauty brings with it
 but i would have the soil of her fair rape
 wiped off in honourable keeping her
 what treason were it to the ransack'd queen
 disgrace to your great worths and shame to me
 now to deliver her possession up
 on terms of base compulsion can it be
 that so degenerate a strain as this
 should once set footing in your generous bosoms
 there's not the meanest spirit on our party
 without a heart to dare or sword to draw
 when helen is defended nor none so noble
 whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
 where helen is the subject then i say
 well may we fight for her whom we know well
 the world's large spaces cannot parallel
hector paris and troilus you have both said well
 and on the cause and question now in hand
 have glozed but superficially not much
 unlike young men whom aristotle thought
 unfit to hear moral philosophy
 the reasons you allege do more conduce
 to the hot passion of distemper'd blood
 than to make up a free determination
 twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge
 have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
 of any true decision nature craves
 all dues be render'd to their owners now
 what nearer debt in all humanity
 than wife is to the husband if this law
 of nature be corrupted through affection
 and that great minds of partial indulgence
 to their benumbed wills resist the same
 there is a law in each wellorder'd nation
 to curb those raging appetites that are
 most disobedient and refractory
 if helen then be wife to sparta's king
 as it is known she is these moral laws
 of nature and of nations speak aloud
 to have her back return'd thus to persist
 in doing wrong extenuates not wrong
 but makes it much more heavy hector's opinion
 is this in way of truth yet ne'ertheless
 my spritely brethren i propend to you
 in resolution to keep helen still
 for tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
 upon our joint and several dignities
troilus why there you touch'd the life of our design
 were it not glory that we more affected
 than the performance of our heaving spleens
 i would not wish a drop of trojan blood
 spent more in her defence but worthy hector
 she is a theme of honour and renown
 a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
 whose present courage may beat down our foes
 and fame in time to come canonize us
 for i presume brave hector would not lose
 so rich advantage of a promised glory
 as smiles upon the forehead of this action
 for the wide world's revenue
hector i am yours
 you valiant offspring of great priamus
 i have a roisting challenge sent amongst
 the dun and factious nobles of the greeks
 will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
 i was advertised their great general slept
 whilst emulation in the army crept
 this i presume will wake him

 would it were otherwise that i could beat him
 whilst he railed at me sfoot i'll learn to
 conjure and raise devils but i'll see some issue of
 my spiteful execrations then there's achilles a
 rare enginer if troy be not taken till these two
 undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of

 forget that thou art jove the king of gods and
 mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy

 takes agamemnon aside
nestor what moves ajax thus to bay at him
ulysses achilles hath inveigled his fool from him
nestor who thersites
ulysses he
nestor then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument
ulysses no you see he is his argument that has his
 argument achilles
nestor all the better their fraction is more our wish than

 could disunite
ulysses the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily
 untie here comes patroclus

nestor no achilles with him
ulysses the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy
 his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure
patroclus achilles bids me say he is much sorry
 if any thing more than your sport and pleasure
 did move your greatness and this noble state
 to call upon him he hopes it is no other
 but for your health and your digestion sake
 and afterdinner's breath
agamemnon hear you patroclus
 we are too well acquainted with these answers
 but his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn
 cannot outfly our apprehensions
 much attribute he hath and much the reason
 why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues
 not virtuously on his own part beheld
 do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss
 yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
 are like to rot untasted go and tell him
 we come to speak with him and you shall not sin
 if you do say we think him overproud
 and underhonest in selfassumption greater
 than in the note of judgment and worthier
 than himself
 here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
 disguise the holy strength of their command
 and underwrite in an observing kind
 his humorous predominance yea watch
 his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if
 the passage and whole carriage of this action
 rode on his tide go tell him this and add
 that if he overhold his price so much
 we'll none of him but let him like an engine
 not portable lie under this report
 bring action hither this cannot go to war
 a stirring dwarf we do allowance give
 before a sleeping giant tell him so
patroclus i shall and bring his answer presently

ajax what is he more than another
agamemnon no more than what he thinks he is
ajax is he so much do you not think he thinks himself a
 better man than i am
agamemnon no question
ajax will you subscribe his thought and say he is
agamemnon no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as
 wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether
 more tractable
ajax why should a man be proud how doth pride grow i
 know not what pride is
agamemnon your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the
 fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is
 his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle
 and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours
 the deed in the praise
ajax i do hate a proud man as i hate the engendering of toads
nestor yet he loves himself is't not strange

ulysses achilles will not to the field tomorrow
agamemnon what's his excuse
ulysses he doth rely on none
 but carries on the stream of his dispose
 without observance or respect of any
 in will peculiar and in selfadmission
agamemnon why will he not upon our fair request
 untent his person and share the air with us
ulysses things small as nothing for request's sake only
 he makes important possess'd he is with greatness
 and speaks not to himself but with a pride
 that quarrels at selfbreath imagined worth
 holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
 that twixt his mental and his active parts
 kingdom'd achilles in commotion rages
 and batters down himself what should i say
 he is so plaguy proud that the deathtokens of it
 cry no recovery'
agamemnon let ajax go to him
 dear lord go you and greet him in his tent
 tis said he holds you well and will be led
 at your request a little from himself
ulysses o agamemnon let it not be so
 we'll consecrate the steps that ajax makes
 when they go from achilles shall the proud lord
 that bastes his arrogance with his own seam
 and never suffers matter of the world
 enter his thoughts save such as do revolve
 and ruminate himself shall he be worshipp'd
 of that we hold an idol more than he
 no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
 must not so stale his palm nobly acquired
 nor by my will assubjugate his merit
 as amply titled as achilles is
 by going to achilles
 that were to enlard his fat already pride
 and add more coals to cancer when he burns
 with entertaining great hyperion
 this lord go to him jupiter forbid
 and say in thunder achilles go to him'
nestor aside to diomedes o this is well he rubs the
 vein of him
diomedes aside to nestor and how his silence drinks up
 this applause
ajax if i go to him with my armed fist i'll pash him o'er the face
agamemnon o no you shall not go
ajax an a be proud with me i'll pheeze his pride
 let me go to him
ulysses not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel
ajax a paltry insolent fellow
nestor how he describes himself
ajax can he not be sociable
ulysses the raven chides blackness
ajax i'll let his humours blood
agamemnon he will be the physician that should be the patient
ajax an all men were o my mind
ulysses wit would be out of fashion
ajax a should not bear it so a should eat swords first
 shall pride carry it
nestor an twould you'ld carry half
ulysses a would have ten shares
ajax i will knead him i'll make him supple
nestor he's not yet through warm force him with praises
 pour in pour in his ambition is dry
ulysses to agamemnon my lord you feed too much on this dislike
nestor our noble general do not do so
diomedes you must prepare to fight without achilles
ulysses why tis this naming of him does him harm
 here is a manbut tis before his face
 i will be silent
nestor wherefore should you so
 he is not emulous as achilles is
ulysses know the whole world he is as valiant
ajax a whoreson dog that shall pelter thus with us
 would he were a trojan
nestor what a vice were it in ajax now
ulysses if he were proud
diomedes or covetous of praise
ulysses ay or surly borne
diomedes or strange or selfaffected
ulysses thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure
 praise him that got thee she that gave thee suck
 famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature
 thrice famed beyond all erudition
 but he that disciplined thy arms to fight
 let mars divide eternity in twain
 and give him half and for thy vigour
 bullbearing milo his addition yield

pandarus o here he comes
 enter troilus
 how now how now
troilus sirrah walk off
 exit boy
pandarus have you seen my cousin
troilus no pandarus i stalk about her door
 like a strange soul upon the stygian banks
 staying for waftage o be thou my charon
 and give me swift transportance to those fields
 where i may wallow in the lilybeds
 proposed for the deserver o gentle pandarus
 from cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
 and fly with me to cressid
pandarus walk here i the orchard i'll bring her straight
 exit
troilus i am giddy expectation whirls me round
 the imaginary relish is so sweet
 that it enchants my sense what will it be
 when that the watery palate tastes indeed
 love's thrice repured nectar death i fear me
 swooning destruction or some joy too fine
 too subtlepotent tuned too sharp in sweetness
 for the capacity of my ruder powers
 i fear it much and i do fear besides
 that i shall lose distinction in my joys
 as doth a battle when they charge on heaps
 the enemy flying
 reenter pandarus
pandarus she's making her ready she'll come straight you
 must be witty now she does so blush and fetches
 her wind so short as if she were frayed with a
 sprite i'll fetch her it is the prettiest
 villain she fetches her breath as short as a
 newta'en sparrow
 exit
troilus even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
 my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse
 and all my powers do their bestowing lose
 like vassalage at unawares encountering
 the eye of majesty
 reenter pandarus with cressida
pandarus come come what need you blush shame's a baby
 here she is now swear the oaths now to her that
 you have sworn to me what are you gone again
 you must be watched ere you be made tame must you
 come your ways come your ways an you draw backward
 we'll put you i the fills why do you not speak to
 her come draw this curtain and let's see your
 picture alas the day how loath you are to offend
 daylight an twere dark you'ld close sooner
 so so rub on and kiss the mistress how now
 a kiss in feefarm build there carpenter the air
 is sweet nay you shall fight your hearts out ere
 i part you the falcon as the tercel for all the
 ducks i the river go to go to
troilus you have bereft me of all words lady
pandarus words pay no debts give her deeds but she'll
 bereave you o the deeds too if she call your
 activity in question what billing again here's
 in witness whereof the parties interchangeably'
 come in come in i'll go get a fire
 exit
cressida will you walk in my lord
troilus o cressida how often have i wished me thus
cressida wished my lord the gods granto my lord
troilus what should they grant what makes this pretty
 abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet
 lady in the fountain of our love
cressida more dregs than water if my fears have eyes
troilus fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly
cressida blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer
 footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to
 fear the worst oft cures the worse
troilus o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid's
 pageant there is presented no monster
cressida nor nothing monstrous neither
troilus nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep
 seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking
 it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
 enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed
 this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will
 is infinite and the execution confined that the
 desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit
cressida they say all lovers swear more performance than they
 are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
 perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and
 discharging less than the tenth part of one they
 that have the voice of lions and the act of hares
 are they not monsters
troilus are there such such are not we praise us as we
 are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go
 bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion
 shall have a praise in present we will not name
 desert before his birth and being born his addition
 shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus
 shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst
 shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can
 speak truest not truer than troilus
cressida will you walk in my lord
 reenter pandarus
pandarus what blushing still have you not done talking yet
cressida well uncle what folly i commit i dedicate to you
pandarus i thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you
 you'll give him me be true to my lord if he
 flinch chide me for it
troilus you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my
 firm faith
pandarus nay i'll give my word for her too our kindred
 though they be long ere they are wooed they are
 constant being won they are burs i can tell you
 they'll stick where they are thrown
cressida boldness comes to me now and brings me heart
 prince troilus i have loved you night and day
 for many weary months
troilus why was my cressid then so hard to win
cressida hard to seem won but i was won my lord
 with the first glance that everpardon me
 if i confess much you will play the tyrant
 i love you now but not till now so much
 but i might master it in faith i lie
 my thoughts were like unbridled children grown
 too headstrong for their mother see we fools
 why have i blabb'd who shall be true to us
 when we are so unsecret to ourselves
 but though i loved you well i woo'd you not
 and yet good faith i wish'd myself a man
 or that we women had men's privilege
 of speaking first sweet bid me hold my tongue
 for in this rapture i shall surely speak
 the thing i shall repent see see your silence
 cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws
 my very soul of counsel stop my mouth
troilus and shall albeit sweet music issues thence
pandarus pretty i faith
cressida my lord i do beseech you pardon me
 twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss
 i am ashamed o heavens what have i done
 for this time will i take my leave my lord
troilus your leave sweet cressid
pandarus leave an you take leave till tomorrow morning
cressida pray you content you
troilus what offends you lady
cressida sir mine own company
troilus you cannot shun yourself
cressida let me go and try
 i have a kind of self resides with you
 but an unkind self that itself will leave
 to be another's fool i would be gone
 where is my wit i know not what i speak
troilus well know they what they speak that speak so wisely
cressida perchance my lord i show more craft than love
 and fell so roundly to a large confession
 to angle for your thoughts but you are wise
 or else you love not for to be wise and love
 exceeds man's might that dwells with gods above
troilus o that i thought it could be in a woman
 as if it can i will presume in you
 to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love
 to keep her constancy in plight and youth
 outliving beauty's outward with a mind
 that doth renew swifter than blood decays
 or that persuasion could but thus convince me
 that my integrity and truth to you
 might be affronted with the match and weight
 of such a winnow'd purity in love
 how were i then uplifted but alas
 i am as true as truth's simplicity
 and simpler than the infancy of truth
cressida in that i'll war with you
troilus o virtuous fight
 when right with right wars who shall be most right
 true swains in love shall in the world to come
 approve their truths by troilus when their rhymes
 full of protest of oath and big compare
 want similes truth tired with iteration
 as true as steel as plantage to the moon
 as sun to day as turtle to her mate
 as iron to adamant as earth to the centre
 yet after all comparisons of truth
 as truth's authentic author to be cited
 as true as troilus shall crown up the verse
 and sanctify the numbers
cressida prophet may you be
 if i be false or swerve a hair from truth
 when time is old and hath forgot itself
 when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy
 and blind oblivion swallow'd cities up
 and mighty states characterless are grated
 to dusty nothing yet let memory
 from false to false among false maids in love
 upbraid my falsehood when they've said as false
 as air as water wind or sandy earth
 as fox to lamb as wolf to heifer's calf
 pard to the hind or stepdame to her son'
 yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood
 as false as cressid'
pandarus go to a bargain made seal it seal it i'll be the
 witness here i hold your hand here my cousin's
 if ever you prove false one to another since i have
 taken such pains to bring you together let all
 pitiful goersbetween be called to the world's end
 after my name call them all pandars let all
 constant men be troiluses all false women cressids
 and all brokersbetween pandars say amen
troilus amen
cressida amen
pandarus amen whereupon i will show you a chamber with a
 bed which bed because it shall not speak of your
 pretty encounters press it to death away
 and cupid grant all tonguetied maidens here
 bed chamber pandar to provide this gear

act iii
scene iii the grecian camp before achilles tent
 enter agamemnon ulysses diomedes nestor ajax
 menelaus and calchas
calchas now princes for the service i have done you
 the advantage of the time prompts me aloud
 to call for recompense appear it to your mind
 that through the sight i bear in things to love
 i have abandon'd troy left my possession
 incurr'd a traitor's name exposed myself
 from certain and possess'd conveniences
 to doubtful fortunes sequestering from me all
 that time acquaintance custom and condition
 made tame and most familiar to my nature
 and here to do you service am become
 as new into the world strange unacquainted
 i do beseech you as in way of taste
 to give me now a little benefit
 out of those many register'd in promise
 which you say live to come in my behalf
agamemnon what wouldst thou of us trojan make demand
calchas you have a trojan prisoner call'd antenor
 yesterday took troy holds him very dear
 oft have youoften have you thanks therefore
 desired my cressid in right great exchange
 whom troy hath still denied but this antenor
 i know is such a wrest in their affairs
 that their negotiations all must slack
 wanting his manage and they will almost
 give us a prince of blood a son of priam
 in change of him let him be sent great princes
 and he shall buy my daughter and her presence
 shall quite strike off all service i have done
 in most accepted pain
agamemnon let diomedes bear him
 and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have
 what he requests of us good diomed
 furnish you fairly for this interchange
 withal bring word if hector will tomorrow
 be answer'd in his challenge ajax is ready
diomedes this shall i undertake and tis a burden
 which i am proud to bear
 exeunt diomedes and calchas
 enter achilles and patroclus before their tent
ulysses achilles stands i the entrance of his tent
 please it our general to pass strangely by him
 as if he were forgot and princes all
 lay negligent and loose regard upon him
 i will come last tis like he'll question me
 why such unplausive eyes are bent on him
 if so i have derision medicinable
 to use between your strangeness and his pride
 which his own will shall have desire to drink
 it may be good pride hath no other glass
 to show itself but pride for supple knees
 feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees
agamemnon we'll execute your purpose and put on
 a form of strangeness as we pass along
 so do each lord and either greet him not
 or else disdainfully which shall shake him more
 than if not look'd on i will lead the way
achilles what comes the general to speak with me
 you know my mind i'll fight no more gainst troy
agamemnon what says achilles would he aught with us
nestor would you my lord aught with the general
achilles no
nestor nothing my lord
agamemnon the better
 exeunt agamemnon and nestor
achilles good day good day
menelaus how do you how do you
 exit
achilles what does the cuckold scorn me
ajax how now patroclus
achilles good morrow ajax
ajax ha
achilles good morrow
ajax ay and good next day too
 exit
achilles what mean these fellows know they not achilles
patroclus they pass by strangely they were used to bend
 to send their smiles before them to achilles
 to come as humbly as they used to creep
 to holy altars
achilles what am i poor of late
 tis certain greatness once fall'n out with fortune
 must fall out with men too what the declined is
 he shall as soon read in the eyes of others
 as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
 show not their mealy wings but to the summer
 and not a man for being simply man
 hath any honour but honour for those honours
 that are without him as place riches favour
 prizes of accident as oft as merit
 which when they fall as being slippery standers
 the love that lean'd on them as slippery too
 do one pluck down another and together
 die in the fall but tis not so with me
 fortune and i are friends i do enjoy
 at ample point all that i did possess
 save these men's looks who do methinks find out
 something not worth in me such rich beholding
 as they have often given here is ulysses
 i'll interrupt his reading
 how now ulysses
ulysses now great thetis son
achilles what are you reading
ulysses a strange fellow here
 writes me that man how dearly ever parted
 how much in having or without or in
 cannot make boast to have that which he hath
 nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
 as when his virtues shining upon others
 heat them and they retort that heat again
 to the first giver'
achilles this is not strange ulysses
 the beauty that is borne here in the face
 the bearer knows not but commends itself
 to others eyes nor doth the eye itself
 that most pure spirit of sense behold itself
 not going from itself but eye to eye opposed
 salutes each other with each other's form
 for speculation turns not to itself
 till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
 where it may see itself this is not strange at all
ulysses i do not strain at the position
 it is familiarbut at the author's drift
 who in his circumstance expressly proves
 that no man is the lord of any thing
 though in and of him there be much consisting
 till he communicate his parts to others
 nor doth he of himself know them for aught
 till he behold them form'd in the applause
 where they're extended who like an arch
 reverberates
 the voice again or like a gate of steel
 fronting the sun receives and renders back
 his figure and his heat i was much wrapt in this
 and apprehended here immediately
 the unknown ajax
 heavens what a man is there a very horse
 that has he knows not what nature what things there are
 most abject in regard and dear in use
 what things again most dear in the esteem
 and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow
 an act that very chance doth throw upon him
 ajax renown'd o heavens what some men do
 while some men leave to do
 how some men creep in skittish fortune's hall
 whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
 how one man eats into another's pride
 while pride is fasting in his wantonness
 to see these grecian lordswhy even already
 they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder
 as if his foot were on brave hector's breast
 and great troy shrieking
achilles i do believe it for they pass'd by me
 as misers do by beggars neither gave to me
 good word nor look what are my deeds forgot
ulysses time hath my lord a wallet at his back
 wherein he puts alms for oblivion
 a greatsized monster of ingratitudes
 those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd
 as fast as they are made forgot as soon
 as done perseverance dear my lord
 keeps honour bright to have done is to hang
 quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
 in monumental mockery take the instant way
 for honour travels in a strait so narrow
 where one but goes abreast keep then the path
 for emulation hath a thousand sons
 that one by one pursue if you give way
 or hedge aside from the direct forthright
 like to an enter'd tide they all rush by
 and leave you hindmost
 or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank
 lie there for pavement to the abject rear
 o'errun and trampled on then what they do in present
 though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours
 for time is like a fashionable host
 that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand
 and with his arms outstretch'd as he would fly
 grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles
 and farewell goes out sighing o let not
 virtue seek
 remuneration for the thing it was
 for beauty wit
 high birth vigour of bone desert in service
 love friendship charity are subjects all
 to envious and calumniating time
 one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
 that all with one consent praise newborn gawds
 though they are made and moulded of things past
 and give to dust that is a little gilt
 more laud than gilt o'erdusted
 the present eye praises the present object
 then marvel not thou great and complete man
 that all the greeks begin to worship ajax
 since things in motion sooner catch the eye
 than what not stirs the cry went once on thee
 and still it might and yet it may again
 if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
 and case thy reputation in thy tent
 whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
 made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves
 and drave great mars to faction
achilles of this my privacy
 i have strong reasons
ulysses but gainst your privacy
 the reasons are more potent and heroical
 tis known achilles that you are in love
 with one of priam's daughters
achilles ha known
ulysses is that a wonder
 the providence that's in a watchful state
 knows almost every grain of plutus gold
 finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps
 keeps place with thought and almost like the gods
 does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
 there is a mysterywith whom relation
 durst never meddlein the soul of state
 which hath an operation more divine
 than breath or pen can give expressure to
 all the commerce that you have had with troy
 as perfectly is ours as yours my lord
 and better would it fit achilles much
 to throw down hector than polyxena
 but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home
 when fame shall in our islands sound her trump
 and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing
 great hector's sister did achilles win
 but our great ajax bravely beat down him'
 farewell my lord i as your lover speak
 the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break
 exit
patroclus to this effect achilles have i moved you
 a woman impudent and mannish grown
 is not more loathed than an effeminate man
 in time of action i stand condemn'd for this
 they think my little stomach to the war
 and your great love to me restrains you thus
 sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid
 shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
 and like a dewdrop from the lion's mane
 be shook to air
achilles shall ajax fight with hector
patroclus ay and perhaps receive much honour by him
achilles i see my reputation is at stake
 my fame is shrewdly gored
patroclus o then beware
 those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
 omission to do what is necessary
 seals a commission to a blank of danger
 and danger like an ague subtly taints
 even then when we sit idly in the sun
achilles go call thersites hither sweet patroclus
 i'll send the fool to ajax and desire him
 to invite the trojan lords after the combat
 to see us here unarm'd i have a woman's longing
 an appetite that i am sick withal
 to see great hector in his weeds of peace
 to talk with him and to behold his visage
 even to my full of view
 enter thersites
 a labour saved
thersites a wonder
achilles what
thersites ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself
achilles how so
thersites he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so
 prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
 raves in saying nothing
achilles how can that be
thersites why he stalks up and down like a peacocka stride
 and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no
 arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning
 bites his lip with a politic regard as who should
 say there were wit in this head an twould out'
 and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire
 in a flint which will not show without knocking
 the man's undone forever for if hector break not his
 neck i the combat he'll break t himself in
 vainglory he knows not me i said good morrow
 ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon what think
 you of this man that takes me for the general he's
 grown a very landfish languageless a monster
 a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both
 sides like a leather jerkin
achilles thou must be my ambassador to him thersites
thersites who i why he'll answer nobody he professes not
 answering speaking is for beggars he wears his
 tongue in's arms i will put on his presence let
 patroclus make demands to me you shall see the
 pageant of ajax
achilles to him patroclus tell him i humbly desire the
 valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector
 to come unarmed to my tent and to procure
 safeconduct for his person of the magnanimous
 and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonoured
 captaingeneral of the grecian army agamemnon
 et cetera do this
patroclus jove bless great ajax
thersites hum
patroclus i come from the worthy achilles
thersites ha
patroclus who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent
thersites hum
patroclus and to procure safeconduct from agamemnon
thersites agamemnon
patroclus ay my lord
thersites ha
patroclus what say you to't
thersites god b wi you with all my heart
patroclus your answer sir
thersites if tomorrow be a fair day by eleven o'clock it will
 go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me
 ere he has me
patroclus your answer sir
thersites fare you well with all my heart
achilles why but he is not in this tune is he
thersites no but he's out o tune thus what music will be in
 him when hector has knocked out his brains i know
 not but i am sure none unless the fiddler apollo
 get his sinews to make catlings on
achilles come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight
thersites let me bear another to his horse for that's the more
 capable creature
achilles my mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd
 and i myself see not the bottom of it
 exeunt achilles and patroclus
thersites would the fountain of your mind were clear again
 that i might water an ass at it i had rather be a
 tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance

 but when i meet you arm'd as black defiance
 as heart can think or courage execute
diomedes the one and other diomed embraces
 our bloods are now in calm and so long health
 but when contention and occasion meet
 by jove i'll play the hunter for thy life
 with all my force pursuit and policy
aeneas and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
 with his face backward in humane gentleness
 welcome to troy now by anchises life
 welcome indeed by venus hand i swear
 no man alive can love in such a sort
 the thing he means to kill more excellently
diomedes we sympathize jove let aeneas live
 if to my sword his fate be not the glory

 but in mine emulous honour let him die
 with every joint a wound and that tomorrow
aeneas we know each other well
diomedes we do and long to know each other worse
paris this is the most despiteful gentle greeting
 the noblest hateful love that e'er i heard of
 what business lord so early
aeneas i was sent for to the king but why i know not
paris his purpose meets you twas to bring this greek
 to calchas house and there to render him
 for the enfreed antenor the fair cressid
 let's have your company or if you please
 haste there before us i constantly do think
 or rather call my thought a certain knowledge
 my brother troilus lodges there tonight
 rouse him and give him note of our approach
 with the whole quality wherefore i fear
 we shall be much unwelcome
aeneas that i assure you
 troilus had rather troy were borne to greece
 than cressid borne from troy
paris there is no help
 the bitter disposition of the time
 will have it so on lord we'll follow you
aeneas good morrow all
 exit with servant
paris and tell me noble diomed faith tell me true
 even in the soul of sound goodfellowship
 who in your thoughts merits fair helen best
 myself or menelaus
diomedes both alike
 he merits well to have her that doth seek her
 not making any scruple of her soilure
 with such a hell of pain and world of charge
 and you as well to keep her that defend her
 not palating the taste of her dishonour
 with such a costly loss of wealth and friends
 he like a puling cuckold would drink up
 the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece
 you like a lecher out of whorish loins
 are pleased to breed out your inheritors
 both merits poised each weighs nor less nor more
 but he as he the heavier for a whore
paris you are too bitter to your countrywoman
diomedes she's bitter to her country hear me paris
 for every false drop in her bawdy veins
 a grecian's life hath sunk for every scruple
 of her contaminated carrion weight
 a trojan hath been slain since she could speak
 she hath not given so many good words breath
 as for her greeks and trojans suffer'd death
paris fair diomed you do as chapmen do
 dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
 but we in silence hold this virtue well
 we'll but commend what we intend to sell
 here lies our way

 comes fast upon good my brother troilus
 tell you the lady what she is to do

pandarus be moderate be moderate
cressida why tell you me of moderation
 the grief is fine full perfect that i taste
 and violenteth in a sense as strong
 as that which causeth it how can i moderate it
 if i could temporize with my affection
 or brew it to a weak and colder palate
 the like allayment could i give my grief
 my love admits no qualifying dross
 no more my grief in such a precious loss
pandarus here here here he comes
 enter troilus
 ah sweet ducks
cressida o troilus troilus
 embracing him
pandarus what a pair of spectacles is here
 let me embrace too o heart as the goodly saying is
 o heart heavy heart
 why sigh'st thou without breaking
 where he answers again
 because thou canst not ease thy smart
 by friendship nor by speaking'
 there was never a truer rhyme let us cast away
 nothing for we may live to have need of such a
 verse we see it we see it how now lambs
troilus cressid i love thee in so strain'd a purity
 that the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy
 more bright in zeal than the devotion which
 cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me
cressida have the gods envy
pandarus ay ay ay ay tis too plain a case
cressida and is it true that i must go from troy
troilus a hateful truth
cressida what and from troilus too
troilus from troy and troilus
cressida is it possible
troilus and suddenly where injury of chance
 puts back leavetaking justles roughly by
 all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips
 of all rejoindure forcibly prevents
 our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows
 even in the birth of our own labouring breath
 we two that with so many thousand sighs
 did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves
 with the rude brevity and discharge of one
 injurious time now with a robber's haste
 crams his rich thievery up he knows not how
 as many farewells as be stars in heaven
 with distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them
 he fumbles up into a lose adieu
 and scants us with a single famish'd kiss
 distasted with the salt of broken tears
aeneas within my lord is the lady ready
troilus hark you are call'd some say the genius so
 cries come to him that instantly must die
 bid them have patience she shall come anon
pandarus where are my tears rain to lay this wind or
 my heart will be blown up by the root
 exit
cressida i must then to the grecians
troilus no remedy
cressida a woful cressid mongst the merry greeks
 when shall we see again
troilus hear me my love be thou but true of heart
cressida i true how now what wicked deem is this
troilus nay we must use expostulation kindly
 for it is parting from us
 i speak not be thou true as fearing thee
 for i will throw my glove to death himself
 that there's no maculation in thy heart
 but be thou true say i to fashion in
 my sequent protestation be thou true
 and i will see thee
cressida o you shall be exposed my lord to dangers
 as infinite as imminent but i'll be true
troilus and i'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve
cressida and you this glove when shall i see you
troilus i will corrupt the grecian sentinels
 to give thee nightly visitation
 but yet be true
cressida o heavens be true again
troilus hear while i speak it love
 the grecian youths are full of quality
 they're loving well composed with gifts of nature
 flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise
 how novelty may move and parts with person
 alas a kind of godly jealousy
 which i beseech you call a virtuous sin
 makes me afeard
cressida o heavens you love me not
troilus die i a villain then
 in this i do not call your faith in question
 so mainly as my merit i cannot sing
 nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
 nor play at subtle games fair virtues all
 to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant
 but i can tell that in each grace of these
 there lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil
 that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted
cressida do you think i will
troilus no
 but something may be done that we will not
 and sometimes we are devils to ourselves
 when we will tempt the frailty of our powers
 presuming on their changeful potency
aeneas within nay good my lord
troilus come kiss and let us part
paris within brother troilus
troilus good brother come you hither
 and bring aeneas and the grecian with you
cressida my lord will you be true
troilus who i alas it is my vice my fault
 whiles others fish with craft for great opinion
 i with great truth catch mere simplicity
 whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns
 with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare
 fear not my truth the moral of my wit
 is plain and true there's all the reach of it
 enter aeneas paris antenor deiphobus

troilus grecian thou dost not use me courteously

 in praising her i tell thee lord of greece

 as thou unworthy to be call'd her servant
 i charge thee use her well even for my charge
 for by the dreadful pluto if thou dost not
 though the great bulk achilles be thy guard
 i'll cut thy throat
diomedes o be not moved prince troilus

 she shall be prized but that you say be't so'
 i'll speak it in my spirit and honour no'

 enter ajax armed agamemnon achilles patroclus
 menelaus ulysses nestor and others
agamemnon here art thou in appointment fresh and fair
 anticipating time with starting courage
 give with thy trumpet a loud note to troy
 thou dreadful ajax that the appalled air
 may pierce the head of the great combatant
 and hale him hither
ajax thou trumpet there's my purse
 now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe
 blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek
 outswell the colic of puff'd aquilon
 come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood
 thou blow'st for hector
 trumpet sounds
ulysses no trumpet answers
achilles tis but early days
agamemnon is not yond diomed with calchas daughter
ulysses tis he i ken the manner of his gait
 he rises on the toe that spirit of his
 in aspiration lifts him from the earth
 enter diomedes with cressida
agamemnon is this the lady cressid
diomedes even she
agamemnon most dearly welcome to the greeks sweet lady
nestor our general doth salute you with a kiss
ulysses yet is the kindness but particular
 twere better she were kiss'd in general
nestor and very courtly counsel i'll begin
 so much for nestor
achilles i'll take what winter from your lips fair lady
 achilles bids you welcome
menelaus i had good argument for kissing once
patroclus but that's no argument for kissing now
 for this popp'd paris in his hardiment
 and parted thus you and your argument
ulysses o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns
 for which we lose our heads to gild his horns
patroclus the first was menelaus kiss this mine
 patroclus kisses you
menelaus o this is trim
patroclus paris and i kiss evermore for him
menelaus i'll have my kiss sir lady by your leave
cressida in kissing do you render or receive
patroclus both take and give
cressida i'll make my match to live
 the kiss you take is better than you give
 therefore no kiss
menelaus i'll give you boot i'll give you three for one
cressida you're an odd man give even or give none
menelaus an odd man lady every man is odd
cressida no paris is not for you know tis true
 that you are odd and he is even with you
menelaus you fillip me o the head
cressida no i'll be sworn
ulysses it were no match your nail against his horn
 may i sweet lady beg a kiss of you
cressida you may
ulysses i do desire it
cressida why beg then
ulysses why then for venus sake give me a kiss
 when helen is a maid again and his
cressida i am your debtor claim it when tis due
ulysses never's my day and then a kiss of you
diomedes lady a word i'll bring you to your father
 exit with cressida
nestor a woman of quick sense
ulysses fie fie upon her
 there's language in her eye her cheek her lip
 nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out
 at every joint and motive of her body
 o these encounterers so glib of tongue
 that give accosting welcome ere it comes
 and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
 to every ticklish reader set them down
 for sluttish spoils of opportunity
 and daughters of the game
 trumpet within
all the trojans trumpet
agamemnon yonder comes the troop
 enter hector armed aeneas troilus and other
 trojans with attendants
aeneas hail all you state of greece what shall be done
 to him that victory commands or do you purpose
 a victor shall be known will you the knights
 shall to the edge of all extremity
 pursue each other or shall be divided
 by any voice or order of the field
 hector bade ask
agamemnon which way would hector have it
aeneas he cares not he'll obey conditions
achilles tis done like hector but securely done
 a little proudly and great deal misprizing
 the knight opposed
aeneas if not achilles sir
 what is your name
achilles if not achilles nothing
aeneas therefore achilles but whate'er know this
 in the extremity of great and little
 valour and pride excel themselves in hector
 the one almost as infinite as all
 the other blank as nothing weigh him well
 and that which looks like pride is courtesy
 this ajax is half made of hector's blood
 in love whereof half hector stays at home
 half heart half hand half hector comes to seek
 this blended knight half trojan and half greek
achilles a maiden battle then o i perceive you
 reenter diomedes
agamemnon here is sir diomed go gentle knight
 stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas
 consent upon the order of their fight
 so be it either to the uttermost
 or else a breath the combatants being kin
 half stints their strife before their strokes begin
 ajax and hector enter the lists
ulysses they are opposed already
agamemnon what trojan is that same that looks so heavy
ulysses the youngest son of priam a true knight
 not yet mature yet matchless firm of word
 speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
 not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd
 his heart and hand both open and both free
 for what he has he gives what thinks he shows
 yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
 nor dignifies an impure thought with breath
 manly as hector but more dangerous
 for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
 to tender objects but he in heat of action
 is more vindicative than jealous love
 they call him troilus and on him erect
 a second hope as fairly built as hector
 thus says aeneas one that knows the youth
 even to his inches and with private soul
 did in great ilion thus translate him to me
 alarum hector and ajax fight
agamemnon they are in action
nestor now ajax hold thine own
troilus hector thou sleep'st
 awake thee
agamemnon his blows are well disposed there ajax
diomedes you must no more
 trumpets cease
aeneas princes enough so please you
ajax i am not warm yet let us fight again
diomedes as hector pleases
hector why then will i no more
 thou art great lord my father's sister's son
 a cousingerman to great priam's seed
 the obligation of our blood forbids
 a gory emulation twixt us twain
 were thy commixtion greek and trojan so
 that thou couldst say this hand is grecian all
 and this is trojan the sinews of this leg
 all greek and this all troy my mother's blood
 runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister
 bounds in my father's by jove multipotent
 thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member
 wherein my sword had not impressure made
 of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay
 that any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother
 my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
 be drain'd let me embrace thee ajax
 by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms
 hector would have them fall upon him thus
 cousin all honour to thee
ajax i thank thee hector
 thou art too gentle and too free a man
 i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence
 a great addition earned in thy death
hector not neoptolemus so mirable
 on whose bright crest fame with her loud'st oyes
 cries this is he could promise to himself
 a thought of added honour torn from hector
aeneas there is expectance here from both the sides
 what further you will do
hector we'll answer it
 the issue is embracement ajax farewell
ajax if i might in entreaties find success
 as seld i have the chancei would desire
 my famous cousin to our grecian tents
diomedes tis agamemnon's wish and great achilles
 doth long to see unarm'd the valiant hector
hector aeneas call my brother troilus to me
 and signify this loving interview
 to the expecters of our trojan part
 desire them home give me thy hand my cousin
 i will go eat with thee and see your knights
ajax great agamemnon comes to meet us here
hector the worthiest of them tell me name by name
 but for achilles mine own searching eyes
 shall find him by his large and portly size
agamemnon worthy of arms as welcome as to one
 that would be rid of such an enemy
 but that's no welcome understand more clear
 what's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
 and formless ruin of oblivion
 but in this extant moment faith and troth
 strain'd purely from all hollow biasdrawing
 bids thee with most divine integrity
 from heart of very heart great hector welcome
hector i thank thee most imperious agamemnon
agamemnon to troilus my wellfamed lord of troy no
 less to you
menelaus let me confirm my princely brother's greeting
 you brace of warlike brothers welcome hither
hector who must we answer
aeneas the noble menelaus
hector o you my lord by mars his gauntlet thanks
 mock not that i affect the untraded oath
 your quondam wife swears still by venus glove
 she's well but bade me not commend her to you
menelaus name her not now sir she's a deadly theme
hector o pardon i offend
nestor i have thou gallant trojan seen thee oft
 labouring for destiny make cruel way
 through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee
 as hot as perseus spur thy phrygian steed
 despising many forfeits and subduements
 when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i the air
 not letting it decline on the declined
 that i have said to some my standers by
 lo jupiter is yonder dealing life'
 and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath
 when that a ring of greeks have hemm'd thee in
 like an olympian wrestling this have i seen
 but this thy countenance still lock'd in steel
 i never saw till now i knew thy grandsire
 and once fought with him he was a soldier good
 but by great mars the captain of us all
 never saw like thee let an old man embrace thee
 and worthy warrior welcome to our tents
aeneas tis the old nestor
hector let me embrace thee good old chronicle
 that hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time
 most reverend nestor i am glad to clasp thee
nestor i would my arms could match thee in contention
 as they contend with thee in courtesy
hector i would they could
nestor ha
 by this white beard i'ld fight with thee tomorrow
 well welcome welcome i have seen the time
ulysses i wonder now how yonder city stands
 when we have here her base and pillar by us
hector i know your favour lord ulysses well
 ah sir there's many a greek and trojan dead
 since first i saw yourself and diomed
 in ilion on your greekish embassy
ulysses sir i foretold you then what would ensue
 my prophecy is but half his journey yet
 for yonder walls that pertly front your town
 yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds
 must kiss their own feet
hector i must not believe you
 there they stand yet and modestly i think
 the fall of every phrygian stone will cost
 a drop of grecian blood the end crowns all
 and that old common arbitrator time
 will one day end it
ulysses so to him we leave it
 most gentle and most valiant hector welcome
 after the general i beseech you next
 to feast with me and see me at my tent
achilles i shall forestall thee lord ulysses thou
 now hector i have fed mine eyes on thee
 i have with exact view perused thee hector
 and quoted joint by joint
hector is this achilles
achilles i am achilles
hector stand fair i pray thee let me look on thee
achilles behold thy fill
hector nay i have done already
achilles thou art too brief i will the second time
 as i would buy thee view thee limb by limb
hector o like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er
 but there's more in me than thou understand'st
 why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye
achilles tell me you heavens in which part of his body
 shall i destroy him whether there or there or there
 that i may give the local wound a name
 and make distinct the very breach whereout
 hector's great spirit flew answer me heavens
hector it would discredit the blest gods proud man
 to answer such a question stand again
 think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
 as to prenominate in nice conjecture
 where thou wilt hit me dead
achilles i tell thee yea
hector wert thou an oracle to tell me so
 i'd not believe thee henceforth guard thee well
 for i'll not kill thee there nor there nor there
 but by the forge that stithied mars his helm
 i'll kill thee every where yea o'er and o'er
 you wisest grecians pardon me this brag
 his insolence draws folly from my lips
 but i'll endeavour deeds to match these words
 or may i never
ajax do not chafe thee cousin
 and you achilles let these threats alone
 till accident or purpose bring you to't
 you may have every day enough of hector
 if you have stomach the general state i fear
 can scarce entreat you to be odd with him
hector i pray you let us see you in the field
 we have had pelting wars since you refused
 the grecians cause
achilles dost thou entreat me hector
 tomorrow do i meet thee fell as death
 tonight all friends
hector thy hand upon that match
agamemnon first all you peers of greece go to my tent
 there in the full convive we afterwards
 as hector's leisure and your bounties shall
 concur together severally entreat him
 beat loud the tabourines let the trumpets blow
 that this great soldier may his welcome know
 exeunt all except troilus and ulysses
troilus my lord ulysses tell me i beseech you
 in what place of the field doth calchas keep
ulysses at menelaus tent most princely troilus
 there diomed doth feast with him tonight
 who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth
 but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
 on the fair cressid
troilus shall sweet lord be bound to you so much
 after we part from agamemnon's tent
 to bring me thither
ulysses you shall command me sir
 as gentle tell me of what honour was
 this cressida in troy had she no lover there
 that wails her absence
troilus o sir to such as boasting show their scars
 a mock is due will you walk on my lord
 she was beloved she loved she is and doth
 but still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth

 troilus farewell one eye yet looks on thee

 ah poor our sex this fault in us i find
 the error of our eye directs our mind
 what error leads must err o then conclude
 minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude
 exit
thersites a proof of strength she could not publish more
 unless she said  my mind is now turn'd whore'
ulysses all's done my lord
troilus it is
ulysses why stay we then
troilus to make a recordation to my soul
 of every syllable that here was spoke
 but if i tell how these two did coact
 shall i not lie in publishing a truth
 sith yet there is a credence in my heart
 an esperance so obstinately strong
 that doth invert the attest of eyes and ears
 as if those organs had deceptious functions
 created only to calumniate
 was cressid here
ulysses i cannot conjure trojan
troilus she was not sure
ulysses most sure she was
troilus why my negation hath no taste of madness
ulysses nor mine my lord cressid was here but now
troilus let it not be believed for womanhood
 think we had mothers do not give advantage
 to stubborn critics apt without a theme
 for depravation to square the general sex
 by cressid's rule rather think this not cressid
ulysses what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers
troilus nothing at all unless that this were she
thersites will he swagger himself out on's own eyes
troilus this she no this is diomed's cressida
 if beauty have a soul this is not she
 if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies
 if sanctimony be the gods delight
 if there be rule in unity itself
 this is not she o madness of discourse
 that cause sets up with and against itself
 bifold authority where reason can revolt
 without perdition and loss assume all reason
 without revolt this is and is not cressid
 within my soul there doth conduce a fight
 of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
 divides more wider than the sky and earth
 and yet the spacious breadth of this division
 admits no orifex for a point as subtle
 as ariachne's broken woof to enter
 instance o instance strong as pluto's gates
 cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
 instance o instance strong as heaven itself
 the bonds of heaven are slipp'd dissolved and loosed
 and with another knot fivefingertied
 the fractions of her faith orts of her love
 the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics
 of her o'ereaten faith are bound to diomed
ulysses may worthy troilus be half attach'd
 with that which here his passion doth express
troilus ay greek and that shall be divulged well
 in characters as red as mars his heart
 inflamed with venus never did young man fancy
 with so eternal and so fix'd a soul
 hark greek as much as i do cressid love
 so much by weight hate i her diomed
 that sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm
 were it a casque composed by vulcan's skill
 my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout
 which shipmen do the hurricano call
 constringed in mass by the almighty sun
 shall dizzy with more clamour neptune's ear
 in his descent than shall my prompted sword
 falling on diomed
thersites he'll tickle it for his concupy
troilus o cressid o false cressid false false false
 let all untruths stand by thy stained name
 and they'll seem glorious
ulysses o contain yourself
 your passion draws ears hither

cassandra no notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother

cassandra the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows

 than spotted livers in the sacrifice
andromache o be persuaded do not count it holy
 to hurt by being just it is as lawful
 for we would give much to use violent thefts
 and rob in the behalf of charity
cassandra it is the purpose that makes strong the vow

 but from her handmaid do return this answer
 the element itself till seven years heat
 shall not behold her face at ample view
 but like a cloistress she will veiled walk
 and water once a day her chamber round
 with eyeoffending brine all this to season
 a brother's dead love which she would keep fresh
 and lasting in her sad remembrance
duke orsino o she that hath a heart of that fine frame
 to pay this debt of love but to a brother
 how will she love when the rich golden shaft
 hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
 that live in her when liver brain and heart
 these sovereign thrones are all supplied and fill'd
 her sweet perfections with one self king
 away before me to sweet beds of flowers
 lovethoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers

scene ii the seacoast
 enter viola a captain and sailors
viola what country friends is this
captain this is illyria lady
viola and what should i do in illyria
 my brother he is in elysium
 perchance he is not drown'd what think you sailors
captain it is perchance that you yourself were saved
viola o my poor brother and so perchance may he be
captain true madam and to comfort you with chance
 assure yourself after our ship did split
 when you and those poor number saved with you
 hung on our driving boat i saw your brother
 most provident in peril bind himself
 courage and hope both teaching him the practise
 to a strong mast that lived upon the sea
 where like arion on the dolphin's back
 i saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
 so long as i could see
viola for saying so there's gold
 mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope
 whereto thy speech serves for authority
 the like of him know'st thou this country
captain ay madam well for i was bred and born
 not three hours travel from this very place
viola who governs here
captain a noble duke in nature as in name
viola what is the name
captain orsino
viola orsino i have heard my father name him
 he was a bachelor then
captain and so is now or was so very late
 for but a month ago i went from hence
 and then twas fresh in murmuras you know
 what great ones do the less will prattle of
 that he did seek the love of fair olivia
viola what's she
captain a virtuous maid the daughter of a count
 that died some twelvemonth since then leaving her
 in the protection of his son her brother
 who shortly also died for whose dear love
 they say she hath abjured the company
 and sight of men
viola o that i served that lady
 and might not be delivered to the world
 till i had made mine own occasion mellow
 what my estate is
captain that were hard to compass
 because she will admit no kind of suit
 no not the duke's
viola there is a fair behavior in thee captain
 and though that nature with a beauteous wall
 doth oft close in pollution yet of thee
 i will believe thou hast a mind that suits
 with this thy fair and outward character
 i prithee and i'll pay thee bounteously
 conceal me what i am and be my aid
 for such disguise as haply shall become
 the form of my intent i'll serve this duke
 thou shall present me as an eunuch to him
 it may be worth thy pains for i can sing
 and speak to him in many sorts of music
 that will allow me very worth his service
 what else may hap to time i will commit
 only shape thou thy silence to my wit
captain be you his eunuch and your mute i'll be
 when my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see
viola i thank thee lead me on

viola alas i took great pains to study it and tis poetical
olivia it is the more like to be feigned i pray you

olivia your lord does know my mind i cannot love him
 yet i suppose him virtuous know him noble
 of great estate of fresh and stainless youth
 in voices well divulged free learn'd and valiant
 and in dimension and the shape of nature
 a gracious person but yet i cannot love him
 he might have took his answer long ago
viola if i did love you in my master's flame
 with such a suffering such a deadly life
 in your denial i would find no sense
 i would not understand it
olivia why what would you
viola make me a willow cabin at your gate
 and call upon my soul within the house
 write loyal cantons of contemned love
 and sing them loud even in the dead of night
 halloo your name to the reverberate hills
 and make the babbling gossip of the air
 cry out olivia o you should not rest
 between the elements of air and earth
 but you should pity me
olivia you might do much
 what is your parentage
viola above my fortunes yet my state is well
 i am a gentleman
olivia get you to your lord

 leave that i may bear my evils alone it were a bad
 recompense for your love to lay any of them on you
antonio let me yet know of you whither you are bound
sebastian no sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere
 extravagancy but i perceive in you so excellent a
 touch of modesty that you will not extort from me
 what i am willing to keep in therefore it charges
 me in manners the rather to express myself you
 must know of me then antonio my name is sebastian
 which i called roderigo my father was that
 sebastian of messaline whom i know you have heard
 of he left behind him myself and a sister both
 born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased
 would we had so ended but you sir altered that
 for some hour before you took me from the breach of
 the sea was my sister drowned
antonio alas the day
sebastian a lady sir though it was said she much resembled
 me was yet of many accounted beautiful but
 though i could not with such estimable wonder
 overfar believe that yet thus far i will boldly
 publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but
 call fair she is drowned already sir with salt
 water though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more
antonio pardon me sir your bad entertainment
sebastian o good antonio forgive me your trouble
antonio if you will not murder me for my love let me be
 your servant
sebastian if you will not undo what you have done that is
 kill him whom you have recovered desire it not
 fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness
 and i am yet so near the manners of my mother that
 upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
 tales of me i am bound to the count orsino's court farewell

 i have many enemies in orsino's court
 else would i very shortly see thee there

 twelfth night
act ii
scene iv duke orsino's palace
 enter duke orsino viola curio and others
duke orsino give me some music now good morrow friends
 now good cesario but that piece of song
 that old and antique song we heard last night
 methought it did relieve my passion much
 more than light airs and recollected terms
 of these most brisk and giddypaced times
 come but one verse
curio he is not here so please your lordship that should sing it
duke orsino who was it
curio feste the jester my lord a fool that the lady
 olivia's father took much delight in he is about the house
duke orsino seek him out and play the tune the while
 exit curio music plays
 come hither boy if ever thou shalt love
 in the sweet pangs of it remember me
 for such as i am all true lovers are
 unstaid and skittish in all motions else
 save in the constant image of the creature
 that is beloved how dost thou like this tune
viola it gives a very echo to the seat
 where love is throned
duke orsino thou dost speak masterly
 my life upon't young though thou art thine eye
 hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves
 hath it not boy
viola a little by your favour
duke orsino what kind of woman is't
viola of your complexion
duke orsino she is not worth thee then what years i faith
viola about your years my lord
duke orsino too old by heaven let still the woman take
 an elder than herself so wears she to him
 so sways she level in her husband's heart
 for boy however we do praise ourselves
 our fancies are more giddy and unfirm
 more longing wavering sooner lost and worn
 than women's are
viola i think it well my lord
duke orsino then let thy love be younger than thyself
 or thy affection cannot hold the bent
 for women are as roses whose fair flower
 being once display'd doth fall that very hour
viola and so they are alas that they are so
 to die even when they to perfection grow
 reenter curio and clown
duke orsino o fellow come the song we had last night
 mark it cesario it is old and plain
 the spinsters and the knitters in the sun
 and the free maids that weave their thread with bones
 do use to chant it it is silly sooth
 and dallies with the innocence of love
 like the old age
clown are you ready sir
duke orsino ay prithee sing
 music
 
 song
clown come away come away death
 and in sad cypress let me be laid
 fly away fly away breath
 i am slain by a fair cruel maid
 my shroud of white stuck all with yew
 o prepare it
 my part of death no one so true
 did share it
 not a flower not a flower sweet
 on my black coffin let there be strown
 not a friend not a friend greet
 my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown
 a thousand thousand sighs to save
 lay me o where
 sad true lover never find my grave
 to weep there
duke orsino there's for thy pains
clown no pains sir i take pleasure in singing sir
duke orsino i'll pay thy pleasure then
clown truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another
duke orsino give me now leave to leave thee
clown now the melancholy god protect thee and the
 tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for
 thy mind is a very opal i would have men of such
 constancy put to sea that their business might be
 every thing and their intent every where for that's
 it that always makes a good voyage of nothing farewell
 exit
duke orsino let all the rest give place
 curio and attendants retire
 once more cesario
 get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
 tell her my love more noble than the world
 prizes not quantity of dirty lands
 the parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her
 tell her i hold as giddily as fortune
 but tis that miracle and queen of gems
 that nature pranks her in attracts my soul
viola but if she cannot love you sir
duke orsino i cannot be so answer'd
viola sooth but you must
 say that some lady as perhaps there is
 hath for your love a great a pang of heart
 as you have for olivia you cannot love her
 you tell her so must she not then be answer'd
duke orsino there is no woman's sides
 can bide the beating of so strong a passion
 as love doth give my heart no woman's heart
 so big to hold so much they lack retention
 alas their love may be call'd appetite
 no motion of the liver but the palate
 that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
 but mine is all as hungry as the sea
 and can digest as much make no compare
 between that love a woman can bear me
 and that i owe olivia
viola ay but i know
duke orsino what dost thou know
viola too well what love women to men may owe
 in faith they are as true of heart as we
 my father had a daughter loved a man
 as it might be perhaps were i a woman
 i should your lordship
duke orsino and what's her history
viola a blank my lord she never told her love
 but let concealment like a worm i the bud
 feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought
 and with a green and yellow melancholy
 she sat like patience on a monument
 smiling at grief was not this love indeed
 we men may say more swear more but indeed
 our shows are more than will for still we prove
 much in our vows but little in our love
duke orsino but died thy sister of her love my boy
viola i am all the daughters of my father's house
 and all the brothers too and yet i know not
 sir shall i to this lady
duke orsino ay that's the theme
 to her in haste give her this jewel say
 my love can give no place bide no denay

malvolio tis but fortune all is fortune maria once told

 thus near that should she fancy it should be one
 of my complexion besides she uses me with a more
 exalted respect than any one else that follows her
 what should i think on't
sir toby belch here's an overweening rogue
fabian o peace contemplation makes a rare turkeycock
 of him how he jets under his advanced plumes

malvolio calling my officers about me in my branched velvet
 gown having come from a daybed where i have left
 olivia sleeping
sir toby belch fire and brimstone

 demure travel of regard telling them i know my
 place as i would they should do theirs to for my
 kinsman toby

fabian though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace
malvolio i extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar
 smile with an austere regard of control
sir toby belch and does not toby take you a blow o the lips then
malvolio saying cousin toby my fortunes having cast me on
 your niece give me this prerogative of speech'
sir toby belch what what
malvolio you must amend your drunkenness'

 uses to seal tis my lady to whom should this be

sir toby belch marry hang thee brock
malvolio reads

 with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore
 m o a i doth sway my life
fabian a fustian riddle
sir toby belch excellent wench say i
malvolio m o a i doth sway my life nay but first let
 me see let me see let me see
fabian what dish o poison has she dressed him
sir toby belch and with what wing the staniel cheques at it
malvolio i may command where i adore why she may command
 me i serve her she is my lady why this is
 evident to any formal capacity there is no
 obstruction in this and the endwhat should
 that alphabetical position portend if i could make
 that resemble something in mesoftly m o a
 i
sir toby belch o ay make up that he is now at a cold scent
fabian sowter will cry upon't for all this though it be as
 rank as a fox
malvolio mmalvolio mwhy that begins my name
fabian did not i say he would work it out the cur is
 excellent at faults
malvolio mbut then there is no consonancy in the sequel
 that suffers under probation a should follow but o does
fabian and o shall end i hope
sir toby belch ay or i'll cudgel him and make him cry o
malvolio and then i comes behind
fabian ay an you had any eye behind you you might see
 more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
 you
malvolio m o a i this simulation is not as the former and
 yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for
 every one of these letters are in my name soft
 here follows prose
 reads
 if this fall into thy hand revolve in my stars i
 am above thee but be not afraid of greatness some
 are born great some achieve greatness and some
 have greatness thrust upon em thy fates open
 their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them
 and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be
 cast thy humble slough and appear fresh be
 opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let
 thy tongue tang arguments of state put thyself into
 the trick of singularity she thus advises thee
 that sighs for thee remember who commended thy
 yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever
 crossgartered i say remember go to thou art
 made if thou desirest to be so if not let me see
 thee a steward still the fellow of servants and
 not worthy to touch fortune's fingers farewell
 she that would alter services with thee
 the fortunateunhappy'
 daylight and champaign discovers not more this is
 open i will be proud i will read politic authors
 i will baffle sir toby i will wash off gross
 acquaintance i will be pointdevise the very man
 i do not now fool myself to let imagination jade
 me for every reason excites to this that my lady
 loves me she did commend my yellow stockings of
 late she did praise my leg being crossgartered
 and in this she manifests herself to my love and
 with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
 of her liking i thank my stars i am happy i will
 be strange stout in yellow stockings and
 crossgartered even with the swiftness of putting
 on jove and my stars be praised here is yet a
 postscript
 reads
 thou canst not choose but know who i am if thou
 entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling
 thy smiles become thee well therefore in my
 presence still smile dear my sweet i prithee'
 jove i thank thee i will smile i will do
 everything that thou wilt have me
 exit
fabian i will not give my part of this sport for a pension
 of thousands to be paid from the sophy
sir toby belch i could marry this wench for this device
sir andrew so could i too
sir toby belch and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest
sir andrew nor i neither
fabian here comes my noble gullcatcher
 reenter maria
sir toby belch wilt thou set thy foot o my neck
sir andrew or o mine either
sir toby belch shall i play my freedom at traytrip and become thy
 bondslave
sir andrew i faith or i either
sir toby belch why thou hast put him in such a dream that when
 the image of it leaves him he must run mad
maria nay but say true does it work upon him
sir toby belch like aquavitae with a midwife
maria if you will then see the fruits of the sport mark
 his first approach before my lady he will come to
 her in yellow stockings and tis a colour she
 abhors and crossgartered a fashion she detests
 and he will smile upon her which will now be so
 unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a
 melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him
 into a notable contempt if you will see it follow
 me
sir toby belch to the gates of tartar thou most excellent devil of wit
sir andrew i'll make one too
 exeunt
 twelfth night
act iii
scene i olivia's garden
 enter viola and clown with a tabour
viola save thee friend and thy music dost thou live by
 thy tabour
clown no sir i live by the church
viola art thou a churchman
clown no such matter sir i do live by the church for
 i do live at my house and my house doth stand by
 the church
viola so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a
 beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy
 tabour if thy tabour stand by the church
clown you have said sir to see this age a sentence is
 but a cheveril glove to a good wit how quickly the
 wrong side may be turned outward
viola nay that's certain they that dally nicely with
 words may quickly make them wanton
clown i would therefore my sister had had no name sir
viola why man
clown why sir her name's a word and to dally with that
 word might make my sister wanton but indeed words
 are very rascals since bonds disgraced them
viola thy reason man
clown troth sir i can yield you none without words and
 words are grown so false i am loath to prove
 reason with them
viola i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing
clown not so sir i do care for something but in my
 conscience sir i do not care for you if that be
 to care for nothing sir i would it would make you invisible
viola art not thou the lady olivia's fool
clown no indeed sir the lady olivia has no folly she
 will keep no fool sir till she be married and
 fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
 herrings the husband's the bigger i am indeed not
 her fool but her corrupter of words
viola i saw thee late at the count orsino's
clown foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun
 it shines every where i would be sorry sir but
 the fool should be as oft with your master as with
 my mistress i think i saw your wisdom there
viola nay an thou pass upon me i'll no more with thee
 hold there's expenses for thee
clown now jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard
viola by my troth i'll tell thee i am almost sick for
 one
 aside
 though i would not have it grow on my chin is thy
 lady within
clown would not a pair of these have bred sir
viola yes being kept together and put to use
clown i would play lord pandarus of phrygia sir to bring
 a cressida to this troilus
viola i understand you sir tis well begged
clown the matter i hope is not great sir begging but
 a beggar cressida was a beggar my lady is
 within sir i will construe to them whence you
 come who you are and what you would are out of my
 welkin i might say element but the word is overworn
 exit
viola this fellow is wise enough to play the fool
 and to do that well craves a kind of wit
 he must observe their mood on whom he jests
 the quality of persons and the time
 and like the haggard cheque at every feather
 that comes before his eye this is a practise
 as full of labour as a wise man's art
 for folly that he wisely shows is fit
 but wise men follyfall'n quite taint their wit
 enter sir toby belch and sir andrew
sir toby belch save you gentleman
viola and you sir
sir andrew dieu vous garde monsieur
viola et vous aussi votre serviteur

viola i am bound to your niece sir i mean she is the
 list of my voyage

viola my legs do better understand me sir than i
 understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs

 are prevented

viola my duty madam and most humble service
olivia what is your name
viola cesario is your servant's name fair princess
olivia my servant sir twas never merry world
 since lowly feigning was call'd compliment
 you're servant to the count orsino youth
viola and he is yours and his must needs be yours
 your servant's servant is your servant madam
olivia for him i think not on him for his thoughts
 would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me
viola madam i come to whet your gentle thoughts
 on his behalf
olivia o by your leave i pray you
 i bade you never speak again of him
 but would you undertake another suit
 i had rather hear you to solicit that
 than music from the spheres
viola dear lady
olivia give me leave beseech you i did send
 after the last enchantment you did here
 a ring in chase of you so did i abuse
 myself my servant and i fear me you
 under your hard construction must i sit
 to force that on you in a shameful cunning
 which you knew none of yours what might you think
 have you not set mine honour at the stake
 and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
 that tyrannous heart can think to one of your receiving
 enough is shown a cypress not a bosom
 hideth my heart so let me hear you speak
viola i pity you
olivia that's a degree to love
viola no not a grize for tis a vulgar proof
 that very oft we pity enemies
olivia why then methinks tis time to smile again
 o world how apt the poor are to be proud
 if one should be a prey how much the better
 to fall before the lion than the wolf
 clock strikes
 the clock upbraids me with the waste of time
 be not afraid good youth i will not have you
 and yet when wit and youth is come to harvest
 your were is alike to reap a proper man
 there lies your way due west
viola then westwardho grace and good disposition
 attend your ladyship
 you'll nothing madam to my lord by me
olivia stay
 i prithee tell me what thou thinkest of me
viola that you do think you are not what you are
olivia if i think so i think the same of you
viola then think you right i am not what i am
olivia i would you were as i would have you be
viola would it be better madam than i am
 i wish it might for now i am your fool
olivia o what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
 in the contempt and anger of his lip
 a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
 than love that would seem hid love's night is noon
 cesario by the roses of the spring
 by maidhood honour truth and every thing
 i love thee so that maugre all thy pride
 nor wit nor reason can my passion hide
 do not extort thy reasons from this clause
 for that i woo thou therefore hast no cause
 but rather reason thus with reason fetter
 love sought is good but given unsought better
viola by innocence i swear and by my youth
 i have one heart one bosom and one truth
 and that no woman has nor never none
 shall mistress be of it save i alone
 and so adieu good madam never more
 will i my master's tears to you deplore
olivia yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move
 that heart which now abhors to like his love

 count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me
 i saw't i the orchard
sir toby belch did she see thee the while old boy tell me that
sir andrew as plain as i see you now
fabian this was a great argument of love in her toward you
sir andrew slight will you make an ass o me
fabian i will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of
 judgment and reason
sir toby belch and they have been grandjurymen since before noah
 was a sailor
fabian she did show favour to the youth in your sight only
 to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to
 put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver
 you should then have accosted her and with some
 excellent jests firenew from the mint you should
 have banged the youth into dumbness this was
 looked for at your hand and this was balked the
 double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
 off and you are now sailed into the north of my
 lady's opinion where you will hang like an icicle
 on a dutchman's beard unless you do redeem it by
 some laudable attempt either of valour or policy
sir andrew an't be any way it must be with valour for policy
 i hate i had as lief be a brownist as a
 politician
sir toby belch why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
 valour challenge me the count's youth to fight
 with him hurt him in eleven places my niece shall
 take note of it and assure thyself there is no
 lovebroker in the world can more prevail in man's
 commendation with woman than report of valour
fabian there is no way but this sir andrew
sir andrew will either of you bear me a challenge to him
sir toby belch go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief
 it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and fun
 of invention taunt him with the licence of ink
 if thou thou'st him some thrice it shall not be
 amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
 paper although the sheet were big enough for the
 bed of ware in england set em down go about it
 let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou
 write with a goosepen no matter about it
sir andrew where shall i find you

 exit sir andrew
fabian this is a dear manikin to you sir toby

 youth to an answer i think oxen and wainropes
 cannot hale them together for andrew if he were
 opened and you find so much blood in his liver as
 will clog the foot of a flea i'll eat the rest of
 the anatomy

 great presage of cruelty

 augmentation of the indies you have not seen such

sebastian i would not by my will have troubled you
 but since you make your pleasure of your pains
 i will no further chide you
antonio i could not stay behind you my desire
 more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth
 and not all love to see you though so much
 as might have drawn one to a longer voyage
 but jealousy what might befall your travel
 being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
 unguided and unfriended often prove
 rough and unhospitable my willing love
 the rather by these arguments of fear
 set forth in your pursuit
sebastian my kind antonio
 i can no other answer make but thanks
 and thanks and ever oft good turns
 are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay
 but were my worth as is my conscience firm

 once in a seafight gainst the count his galleys
 i did some service of such note indeed
 that were i ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd
sebastian belike you slew great number of his people
antonio the offence is not of such a bloody nature
 albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
 might well have given us bloody argument
 it might have since been answer'd in repaying
 what we took from them which for traffic's sake
 most of our city did only myself stood out
 for which if i be lapsed in this place
 i shall pay dear
sebastian do not then walk too open
antonio it doth not fit me hold sir here's my purse
 in the south suburbs at the elephant
 is best to lodge i will bespeak our diet
 whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
 with viewing of the town there shall you have me
sebastian why i your purse

 you have desire to purchase and your store
 i think is not for idle markets sir
sebastian i'll be your pursebearer and leave you
 for an hour

 limed her but it is jove's doing and jove make me
 thankful and when she went away now let this

 orchard like a bumbaily so soon as ever thou seest
 him draw and as thou drawest swear horrible for

 swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood
 more approbation than ever proof itself would have
 earned him away
sir andrew nay let me alone for swearing
 exit
sir toby belch now will not i deliver his letter for the behavior
 of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
 capacity and breeding his employment between his
 lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this
 letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no
 terror in the youth he will find it comes from a
 clodpole but sir i will deliver his challenge by
 word of mouth set upon aguecheek a notable report
 of valour and drive the gentleman as i know his
 youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous
 opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity
 this will so fright them both that they will kill
 one another by the look like cockatrices
 reenter olivia with viola
fabian here he comes with your niece give them way till
 he take leave and presently after him
sir toby belch i will meditate the while upon some horrid message
 for a challenge
 exeunt sir toby belch fabian and maria

 goes on my master's grief
olivia here wear this jewel for me tis my picture

 conduct of the lady i am no fighter i have heard
 of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
 others to taste their valour belike this is a man
 of that quirk

 very competent injury therefore get you on and
 give him his desire back you shall not to the
 house unless you undertake that with me which with
 as much safety you might answer him therefore on

 must that's certain or forswear to wear iron about you

sebastian this is the air that is the glorious sun
 this pearl she gave me i do feel't and see't
 and though tis wonder that enwraps me thus
 yet tis not madness where's antonio then
 i could not find him at the elephant
 yet there he was and there i found this credit
 that he did range the town to seek me out
 his counsel now might do me golden service
 for though my soul disputes well with my sense
 that this may be some error but no madness
 yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
 so far exceed all instance all discourse
 that i am ready to distrust mine eyes
 and wrangle with my reason that persuades me
 to any other trust but that i am mad
 or else the lady's mad yet if twere so
 she could not sway her house command her followers
 take and give back affairs and their dispatch
 with such a smooth discreet and stable bearing
 as i perceive she does there's something in't
 that is deceiveable but here the lady comes
 enter olivia and priest
olivia blame not this haste of mine if you mean well
 now go with me and with this holy man
 into the chantry by there before him
 and underneath that consecrated roof
 plight me the full assurance of your faith
 that my most jealous and too doubtful soul
 may live at peace he shall conceal it
 whiles you are willing it shall come to note
 what time we will our celebration keep
 according to my birth what do you say
sebastian i'll follow this good man and go with you
 and having sworn truth ever will be true
olivia then lead the way good father and heavens so shine
 that they may fairly note this act of mine

viola here comes the man sir that did rescue me
 enter antonio and officers
duke orsino that face of his i do remember well
 yet when i saw it last it was besmear'd
 as black as vulcan in the smoke of war
 a bawbling vessel was he captain of
 for shallow draught and bulk unprizable
 with which such scathful grapple did he make
 with the most noble bottom of our fleet
 that very envy and the tongue of loss
 cried fame and honour on him what's the matter
first officer orsino this is that antonio
 that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy
 and this is he that did the tiger board
 when your young nephew titus lost his leg
 here in the streets desperate of shame and state
 in private brabble did we apprehend him
viola he did me kindness sir drew on my side
 but in conclusion put strange speech upon me
 i know not what twas but distraction
duke orsino notable pirate thou saltwater thief
 what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
 whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear
 hast made thine enemies
antonio orsino noble sir
 be pleased that i shake off these names you give me
 antonio never yet was thief or pirate
 though i confess on base and ground enough
 orsino's enemy a witchcraft drew me hither
 that most ingrateful boy there by your side
 from the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
 did i redeem a wreck past hope he was
 his life i gave him and did thereto add
 my love without retention or restraint
 all his in dedication for his sake
 did i expose myself pure for his love
 into the danger of this adverse town
 drew to defend him when he was beset
 where being apprehended his false cunning
 not meaning to partake with me in danger
 taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
 and grew a twenty years removed thing
 while one would wink denied me mine own purse
 which i had recommended to his use
 not half an hour before
viola how can this be
duke orsino when came he to this town
antonio today my lord and for three months before
 no interim not a minute's vacancy
 both day and night did we keep company
 enter olivia and attendants
duke orsino here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth
 but for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness

 but more of that anon take him aside

duke orsino what to perverseness you uncivil lady
 to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
 my soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
 that e'er devotion tender'd what shall i do
olivia even what it please my lord that shall become him
duke orsino why should i not had i the heart to do it
 like to the egyptian thief at point of death
 kill what i lovea savage jealousy
 that sometimes savours nobly but hear me this
 since you to nonregardance cast my faith
 and that i partly know the instrument
 that screws me from my true place in your favour
 live you the marblebreasted tyrant still
 but this your minion whom i know you love
 and whom by heaven i swear i tender dearly
 him will i tear out of that cruel eye
 where he sits crowned in his master's spite
 come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief
 i'll sacrifice the lamb that i do love
 to spite a raven's heart within a dove
viola and i most jocund apt and willingly
 to do you rest a thousand deaths would die
olivia where goes cesario
viola after him i love
 more than i love these eyes more than my life
 more by all mores than e'er i shall love wife
 if i do feign you witnesses above
 punish my life for tainting of my love

 confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands
 attested by the holy close of lips
 strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings
 and all the ceremony of this compact
 seal'd in my function by my testimony
 since when my watch hath told me toward my grave
 i have travell'd but two hours
duke orsino o thou dissembling cub what wilt thou be
 when time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case
 or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
 that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow

 enter sebastian
sebastian i am sorry madam i have hurt your kinsman
 but had it been the brother of my blood
 i must have done no less with wit and safety
 you throw a strange regard upon me and by that
 i do perceive it hath offended you
 pardon me sweet one even for the vows
 we made each other but so late ago
duke orsino one face one voice one habit and two persons
 a natural perspective that is and is not
sebastian antonio o my dear antonio
 how have the hours rack'd and tortured me
 since i have lost thee
antonio sebastian are you
sebastian fear'st thou that antonio
antonio how have you made division of yourself
 an apple cleft in two is not more twin
 than these two creatures which is sebastian
olivia most wonderful
sebastian do i stand there i never had a brother
 nor can there be that deity in my nature
 of here and every where i had a sister
 whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd
 of charity what kin are you to me
 what countryman what name what parentage
viola of messaline sebastian was my father
 such a sebastian was my brother too
 so went he suited to his watery tomb
 if spirits can assume both form and suit
 you come to fright us
sebastian a spirit i am indeed
 but am in that dimension grossly clad
 which from the womb i did participate
 were you a woman as the rest goes even
 i should my tears let fall upon your cheek
 and say thricewelcome drowned viola'
viola my father had a mole upon his brow
sebastian and so had mine
viola and died that day when viola from her birth
 had number'd thirteen years
sebastian o that record is lively in my soul
 he finished indeed his mortal act
 that day that made my sister thirteen years
viola if nothing lets to make us happy both
 but this my masculine usurp'd attire
 do not embrace me till each circumstance
 of place time fortune do cohere and jump
 that i am viola which to confirm
 i'll bring you to a captain in this town
 where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help
 i was preserved to serve this noble count
 all the occurrence of my fortune since
 hath been between this lady and this lord
sebastian to olivia so comes it lady you have been mistook
 but nature to her bias drew in that
 you would have been contracted to a maid
 nor are you therein by my life deceived
 you are betroth'd both to a maid and man
duke orsino be not amazed right noble is his blood
 if this be so as yet the glass seems true
 i shall have share in this most happy wreck
 to viola
 boy thou hast said to me a thousand times
 thou never shouldst love woman like to me
viola and all those sayings will i overswear
 and those swearings keep as true in soul
 as doth that orbed continent the fire
 that severs day from night
duke orsino give me thy hand
 and let me see thee in thy woman's weeds
viola the captain that did bring me first on shore
 hath my maid's garments he upon some action
 is now in durance at malvolio's suit
 a gentleman and follower of my lady's
olivia he shall enlarge him fetch malvolio hither
 and yet alas now i remember me
 they say poor gentleman he's much distract
 reenter clown with a letter and fabian
 a most extracting frenzy of mine own
 from my remembrance clearly banish'd his
 how does he sirrah
clown truly madam he holds belzebub at the staves's end as
 well as a man in his case may do has here writ a
 letter to you i should have given't you today
 morning but as a madman's epistles are no gospels
 so it skills not much when they are delivered
olivia open't and read it
clown look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
 the madman
 reads
 by the lord madam'
olivia how now art thou mad
clown no madam i do but read madness an your ladyship
 will have it as it ought to be you must allow vox
olivia prithee read i thy right wits
clown so i do madonna but to read his right wits is to
 read thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear
olivia read it you sirrah
 to fabian
fabian reads by the lord madam you wrong me and the
 world shall know it though you have put me into
 darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
 me yet have i the benefit of my senses as well as
 your ladyship i have your own letter that induced
 me to the semblance i put on with the which i doubt
 not but to do myself much right or you much shame
 think of me as you please i leave my duty a little
 unthought of and speak out of my injury
 the madlyused malvolio'
olivia did he write this
clown ay madam
duke orsino this savours not much of distraction
olivia see him deliver'd fabian bring him hither
 exit fabian
 my lord so please you these things further
 thought on
 to think me as well a sister as a wife
 one day shall crown the alliance on't so please you
 here at my house and at my proper cost
duke orsino madam i am most apt to embrace your offer
 to viola
 your master quits you and for your service done him
 so much against the mettle of your sex
 so far beneath your soft and tender breeding
 and since you call'd me master for so long
 here is my hand you shall from this time be
 your master's mistress
olivia a sister you are she
 reenter fabian with malvolio
duke orsino is this the madman
olivia ay my lord this same
 how now malvolio
malvolio madam you have done me wrong
 notorious wrong
olivia have i malvolio no
malvolio lady you have pray you peruse that letter
 you must not now deny it is your hand
 write from it if you can in hand or phrase
 or say tis not your seal nor your invention
 you can say none of this well grant it then
 and tell me in the modesty of honour
 why you have given me such clear lights of favour
 bade me come smiling and crossgarter'd to you
 to put on yellow stockings and to frown
 upon sir toby and the lighter people
 and acting this in an obedient hope
 why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd
 kept in a dark house visited by the priest
 and made the most notorious geck and gull
 that e'er invention play'd on tell me why
olivia alas malvolio this is not my writing
 though i confess much like the character
 but out of question tis maria's hand
 and now i do bethink me it was she
 first told me thou wast mad then camest in smiling
 and in such forms which here were presupposed
 upon thee in the letter prithee be content
 this practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee
 but when we know the grounds and authors of it
 thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
 of thine own cause
fabian good madam hear me speak
 and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
 taint the condition of this present hour
 which i have wonder'd at in hope it shall not
 most freely i confess myself and toby
 set this device against malvolio here
 upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
 we had conceived against him maria writ
 the letter at sir toby's great importance
 in recompense whereof he hath married her
 how with a sportful malice it was follow'd
 may rather pluck on laughter than revenge
 if that the injuries be justly weigh'd
 that have on both sides pass'd
olivia alas poor fool how have they baffled thee
clown why some are born great some achieve greatness
 and some have greatness thrown upon them i was
 one sir in this interlude one sir topas sir but
 that's all one by the lord fool i am not mad'
 but do you remember madam why laugh you at such
 a barren rascal an you smile not he's gagged'
 and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges
malvolio i'll be revenged on the whole pack of you
 exit
olivia he hath been most notoriously abused
duke orsino pursue him and entreat him to a peace
 he hath not told us of the captain yet
 when that is known and golden time convents
 a solemn combination shall be made
 of our dear souls meantime sweet sister
 we will not part from hence cesario come
 for so you shall be while you are a man
 but when in other habits you are seen
 orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen
 exeunt all except clown
clown sings
 when that i was and a little tiny boy
 with hey ho the wind and the rain
 a foolish thing was but a toy
 for the rain it raineth every day
 but when i came to man's estate
 with hey ho &c
 gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
 for the rain &c
 but when i came alas to wive
 with hey ho &c
 by swaggering could i never thrive
 for the rain &c
 but when i came unto my beds
 with hey ho &c
 with tosspots still had drunken heads
 for the rain &c
 a great while ago the world begun
 with hey ho &c
 but that's all one our play is done
 and we'll strive to please you every day

valentine cease to persuade my loving proteus
 homekeeping youth have ever homely wits
 were't not affection chains thy tender days
 to the sweet glances of thy honour'd love
 i rather would entreat thy company
 to see the wonders of the world abroad
 than living dully sluggardized at home
 wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
 but since thou lovest love still and thrive therein
 even as i would when i to love begin
proteus wilt thou be gone sweet valentine adieu
 think on thy proteus when thou haply seest
 some rare noteworthy object in thy travel
 wish me partaker in thy happiness
 when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
 if ever danger do environ thee
 commend thy grievance to my holy prayers
 for i will be thy beadsman valentine
valentine and on a lovebook pray for my success
proteus upon some book i love i'll pray for thee
valentine that's on some shallow story of deep love
 how young leander cross'd the hellespont
proteus that's a deep story of a deeper love
 for he was more than over shoes in love
valentine tis true for you are over boots in love
 and yet you never swum the hellespont
proteus over the boots nay give me not the boots
valentine no i will not for it boots thee not
proteus what
valentine to be in love where scorn is bought with groans
 coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moment's mirth
 with twenty watchful weary tedious nights
 if haply won perhaps a hapless gain
 if lost why then a grievous labour won
 however but a folly bought with wit
 or else a wit by folly vanquished
proteus so by your circumstance you call me fool
valentine so by your circumstance i fear you'll prove
proteus tis love you cavil at i am not love
valentine love is your master for he masters you
 and he that is so yoked by a fool
 methinks should not be chronicled for wise
proteus yet writers say as in the sweetest bud
 the eating canker dwells so eating love
 inhabits in the finest wits of all
valentine and writers say as the most forward bud
 is eaten by the canker ere it blow
 even so by love the young and tender wit
 is turn'd to folly blasting in the bud
 losing his verdure even in the prime
 and all the fair effects of future hopes
 but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee
 that art a votary to fond desire
 once more adieu my father at the road
 expects my coming there to see me shipp'd
proteus and thither will i bring thee valentine
valentine sweet proteus no now let us take our leave
 to milan let me hear from thee by letters
 of thy success in love and what news else
 betideth here in absence of thy friend
 and likewise will visit thee with mine
proteus all happiness bechance to thee in milan

 made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought
 enter speed
speed sir proteus save you saw you my master
proteus but now he parted hence to embark for milan
speed twenty to one then he is shipp'd already
 and i have play'd the sheep in losing him
proteus indeed a sheep doth very often stray
 an if the shepherd be a while away
speed you conclude that my master is a shepherd then
 and i a sheep
proteus i do
speed why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep
proteus a silly answer and fitting well a sheep
speed this proves me still a sheep
proteus true and thy master a shepherd
speed nay that i can deny by a circumstance
proteus it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another
speed the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the
 shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks
 not me therefore i am no sheep
proteus the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the
 shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for
 wages followest thy master thy master for wages
 follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep
speed such another proof will make me cry baa'
proteus but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to julia
speed ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her
 a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a
 lost mutton nothing for my labour
proteus here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons
speed if the ground be overcharged you were best stick her
proteus nay in that you are astray twere best pound you
speed nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for
 carrying your letter
proteus you mistake i mean the pounda pinfold
speed from a pound to a pin fold it over and over
 tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
 your lover
proteus but what said she
speed first nodding ay
proteus nodaywhy that's noddy
speed you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask
 me if she did nod and i say ay'
proteus and that set together is noddy
speed now you have taken the pains to set it together
 take it for your pains
proteus no no you shall have it for bearing the letter
speed well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you
proteus why sir how do you bear with me
speed marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing
 but the word noddy for my pains
proteus beshrew me but you have a quick wit
speed and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse
proteus come come open the matter in brief what said she
speed open your purse that the money and the matter may
 be both at once delivered
proteus well sir here is for your pains what said she
speed truly sir i think you'll hardly win her
proteus why couldst thou perceive so much from her
speed sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no
 not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter
 and being so hard to me that brought your mind i
 fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
 mind give her no token but stones for she's as
 hard as steel
proteus what said she nothing
speed no not so much as take this for thy pains to
 testify your bounty i thank you you have testerned
 me in requital whereof henceforth carry your
 letters yourself and so sir i'll commend you to my master
proteus go go be gone to save your ship from wreck
 which cannot perish having thee aboard
 being destined to a drier death on shore

scene ii the same garden of julia's house
 enter julla and lucetta
julia but say lucetta now we are alone
 wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
lucetta ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully
julia of all the fair resort of gentlemen
 that every day with parle encounter me
 in thy opinion which is worthiest love
lucetta please you repeat their names i'll show my mind
 according to my shallow simple skill
julia what think'st thou of the fair sir eglamour
lucetta as of a knight wellspoken neat and fine
 but were i you he never should be mine
julia what think'st thou of the rich mercatio
lucetta well of his wealth but of himself so so
julia what think'st thou of the gentle proteus
lucetta lord lord to see what folly reigns in us
julia how now what means this passion at his name
lucetta pardon dear madam tis a passing shame
 that i unworthy body as i am
 should censure thus on lovely gentlemen
julia why not on proteus as of all the rest
lucetta then thus of many good i think him best
julia your reason
lucetta i have no other but a woman's reason
 i think him so because i think him so
julia and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
lucetta ay if you thought your love not cast away
julia why he of all the rest hath never moved me
lucetta yet he of all the rest i think best loves ye
julia his little speaking shows his love but small
lucetta fire that's closest kept burns most of all
julia they do not love that do not show their love
lucetta o they love least that let men know their love
julia i would i knew his mind
lucetta peruse this paper madam
julia to julia say from whom
lucetta that the contents will show
julia say say who gave it thee
lucetta valentine's page and sent i think from proteus
 he would have given it you but i being in the way
 did in your name receive it pardon the
 fault i pray
julia now by my modesty a goodly broker
 dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
 to whisper and conspire against my youth
 now trust me tis an office of great worth
 and you an officer fit for the place
 or else return no more into my sight
lucetta to plead for love deserves more fee than hate
julia will ye be gone
lucetta that you may ruminate
 exit
julia and yet i would i had o'erlooked the letter
 it were a shame to call her back again
 and pray her to a fault for which i chid her
 what a fool is she that knows i am a maid
 and would not force the letter to my view
 since maids in modesty say no to that
 which they would have the profferer construe ay'
 fie fie how wayward is this foolish love
 that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
 and presently all humbled kiss the rod
 how churlishly i chid lucetta hence
 when willingly i would have had her here
 how angerly i taught my brow to frown
 when inward joy enforced my heart to smile
 my penance is to call lucetta back
 and ask remission for my folly past
 what ho lucetta
 reenter lucetta
lucetta what would your ladyship
julia is't near dinnertime
lucetta i would it were
 that you might kill your stomach on your meat
 and not upon your maid
julia what is't that you took up so gingerly
lucetta nothing
julia why didst thou stoop then
lucetta to take a paper up that i let fall
julia and is that paper nothing
lucetta nothing concerning me
julia then let it lie for those that it concerns
lucetta madam it will not lie where it concerns
 unless it have a false interpeter
julia some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme
lucetta that i might sing it madam to a tune
 give me a note your ladyship can set
julia as little by such toys as may be possible
 best sing it to the tune of light o love'
lucetta it is too heavy for so light a tune
julia heavy belike it hath some burden then
lucetta ay and melodious were it would you sing it
julia and why not you
lucetta i cannot reach so high
julia let's see your song how now minion
lucetta keep tune there still so you will sing it out
 and yet methinks i do not like this tune
julia you do not
lucetta no madam it is too sharp
julia you minion are too saucy
lucetta nay now you are too flat
 and mar the concord with too harsh a descant
 there wanteth but a mean to fill your song
julia the mean is drown'd with your unruly bass
lucetta indeed i bid the base for proteus
julia this babble shall not henceforth trouble me
 here is a coil with protestation
 tears the letter
 go get you gone and let the papers lie
 you would be fingering them to anger me
lucetta she makes it strange but she would be best pleased
 to be so anger'd with another letter
 exit
julia nay would i were so anger'd with the same
 o hateful hands to tear such loving words
 injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
 and kill the bees that yield it with your stings
 i'll kiss each several paper for amends
 look here is writ kind julia unkind julia
 as in revenge of thy ingratitude
 i throw thy name against the bruising stones
 trampling contemptuously on thy disdain
 and here is writ lovewounded proteus'
 poor wounded name my bosom as a bed
 shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd
 and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss
 but twice or thrice was proteus written down
 be calm good wind blow not a word away
 till i have found each letter in the letter
 except mine own name that some whirlwind bear
 unto a ragged fearfulhanging rock
 and throw it thence into the raging sea
 lo here in one line is his name twice writ
 poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus
 to the sweet julia that i'll tear away
 and yet i will not sith so prettily
 he couples it to his complaining names
 thus will i fold them one on another
 now kiss embrace contend do what you will
 reenter lucetta
lucetta madam
 dinner is ready and your father stays
julia well let us go
lucetta what shall these papers lie like telltales here
julia if you respect them best to take them up
lucetta nay i was taken up for laying them down
 yet here they shall not lie for catching cold
julia i see you have a month's mind to them
lucetta ay madam you may say what sights you see
 i see things too although you judge i wink
julia come come will't please you go

 put forth their sons to seek preferment out
 some to the wars to try their fortune there
 some to discover islands far away
 some to the studious universities
 for any or for all these exercises
 he said that proteus your son was meet
 and did request me to importune you
 to let him spend his time no more at home
 which would be great impeachment to his age
 in having known no travel in his youth
antonio nor need'st thou much importune me to that
 whereon this month i have been hammering
 i have consider'd well his loss of time
 and how he cannot be a perfect man
 not being tried and tutor'd in the world
 experience is by industry achieved
 and perfected by the swift course of time
 then tell me whither were i best to send him
panthino i think your lordship is not ignorant
 how his companion youthful valentine
 attends the emperor in his royal court
antonio i know it well
panthino twere good i think your lordship sent him thither
 there shall he practise tilts and tournaments
 hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen
 and be in eye of every exercise
 worthy his youth and nobleness of birth
antonio i like thy counsel well hast thou advised
 and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it
 the execution of it shall make known
 even with the speediest expedition
 i will dispatch him to the emperor's court
panthino tomorrow may it please you don alphonso
 with other gentlemen of good esteem
 are journeying to salute the emperor
 and to commend their service to his will
antonio good company with them shall proteus go
 and in good time now will we break with him
 enter proteus
proteus sweet love sweet lines sweet life
 here is her hand the agent of her heart
 here is her oath for love her honour's pawn
 o that our fathers would applaud our loves
 to seal our happiness with their consents
 o heavenly julia
antonio how now what letter are you reading there
proteus may't please your lordship tis a word or two
 of commendations sent from valentine
 deliver'd by a friend that came from him
antonio lend me the letter let me see what news
proteus there is no news my lord but that he writes
 how happily he lives how well beloved
 and daily graced by the emperor
 wishing me with him partner of his fortune
antonio and how stand you affected to his wish
proteus as one relying on your lordship's will
 and not depending on his friendly wish
antonio my will is something sorted with his wish
 muse not that i thus suddenly proceed
 for what i will i will and there an end
 i am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
 with valentinus in the emperor's court
 what maintenance he from his friends receives
 like exhibition thou shalt have from me
 tomorrow be in readiness to go
 excuse it not for i am peremptory
proteus my lord i cannot be so soon provided
 please you deliberate a day or two
antonio look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee
 no more of stay tomorrow thou must go
 come on panthino you shall be employ'd
 to hasten on his expedition
 exeunt antonio and panthino
proteus thus have i shunn'd the fire for fear of burning
 and drench'd me in the sea where i am drown'd
 i fear'd to show my father julia's letter
 lest he should take exceptions to my love
 and with the vantage of mine own excuse
 hath he excepted most against my love
 o how this spring of love resembleth
 the uncertain glory of an april day
 which now shows all the beauty of the sun
 and by and by a cloud takes all away
 reenter panthino
panthino sir proteus your father calls for you
 he is in haste therefore i pray you to go
proteus why this it is my heart accords thereto
 and yet a thousand times it answers no'

valentine how now sirrah
speed she is not within hearing sir
valentine why sir who bade you call her
speed your worship sir or else i mistook
valentine well you'll still be too forward
speed and yet i was last chidden for being too slow
valentine go to sir tell me do you know madam silvia
speed she that your worship loves
valentine why how know you that i am in love
speed marry by these special marks first you have
 learned like sir proteus to wreathe your arms
 like a malecontent to relish a lovesong like a
 robinredbreast to walk alone like one that had
 the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had
 lost his a b c to weep like a young wench that had
 buried her grandam to fast like one that takes
 diet to watch like one that fears robbing to
 speak puling like a beggar at hallowmas you were
 wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you
 walked to walk like one of the lions when you
 fasted it was presently after dinner when you
 looked sadly it was for want of money and now you
 are metamorphosed with a mistress that when i look
 on you i can hardly think you my master
valentine are all these things perceived in me
speed they are all perceived without ye
valentine without me they cannot
speed without you nay that's certain for without you
 were so simple none else would but you are so
 without these follies that these follies are within
 you and shine through you like the water in an
 urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a
 physician to comment on your malady
valentine but tell me dost thou know my lady silvia
speed she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
valentine hast thou observed that even she i mean
speed why sir i know her not
valentine dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet
 knowest her not
speed is she not hardfavoured sir
valentine not so fair boy as wellfavoured
speed sir i know that well enough
valentine what dost thou know
speed that she is not so fair as of you wellfavoured
valentine i mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite
speed that's because the one is painted and the other out
 of all count
valentine how painted and how out of count
speed marry sir so painted to make her fair that no
 man counts of her beauty
valentine how esteemest thou me i account of her beauty
speed you never saw her since she was deformed
valentine how long hath she been deformed
speed ever since you loved her
valentine i have loved her ever since i saw her and still i
 see her beautiful
speed if you love her you cannot see her
valentine why
speed because love is blind o that you had mine eyes
 or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
 have when you chid at sir proteus for going
 ungartered
valentine what should i see then
speed your own present folly and her passing deformity
 for he being in love could not see to garter his
 hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose
valentine belike boy then you are in love for last
 morning you could not see to wipe my shoes
speed true sir i was in love with my bed i thank you
 you swinged me for my love which makes me the
 bolder to chide you for yours
valentine in conclusion i stand affected to her
speed i would you were set so your affection would cease
valentine last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
 one she loves
speed and have you
valentine i have
speed are they not lamely writ

speed aside he should give her interest and she gives it him
valentine as you enjoin'd me i have writ your letter
 unto the secret nameless friend of yours
 which i was much unwilling to proceed in
 but for my duty to your ladyship
silvia i thank you gentle servant tis very clerkly done
valentine now trust me madam it came hardly off
 for being ignorant to whom it goes
 i writ at random very doubtfully
silvia perchance you think too much of so much pains
valentine no madam so it stead you i will write
 please you command a thousand times as much and yet
silvia a pretty period well i guess the sequel
 and yet i will not name it and yet i care not
 and yet take this again and yet i thank you
 meaning henceforth to trouble you no more
speed aside and yet you will and yet another yet'
valentine what means your ladyship do you not like it
silvia yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ
 but since unwillingly take them again
 nay take them
valentine madam they are for you
silvia ay ay you writ them sir at my request
 but i will none of them they are for you
 i would have had them writ more movingly
valentine please you i'll write your ladyship another
silvia and when it's writ for my sake read it over

 that my master being scribe to himself should write
 the letter
valentine how now sir what are you reasoning with yourself
speed nay i was rhyming tis you that have the reason
valentine to do what
speed to be a spokesman for madam silvia
valentine to whom
speed to yourself why she wooes you by a figure
valentine what figure
speed by a letter i should say
valentine why she hath not writ to me
speed what need she when she hath made you write to
 yourself why do you not perceive the jest
valentine no believe me
speed no believing you indeed sir but did you perceive
 her earnest
valentine she gave me none except an angry word
speed why she hath given you a letter
valentine that's the letter i writ to her friend
speed and that letter hath she delivered and there an end
valentine i would it were no worse
speed i'll warrant you tis as well
 for often have you writ to her and she in modesty
 or else for want of idle time could not again reply
 or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover
 herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover
 all this i speak in print for in print i found it
 why muse you sir tis dinnertime
valentine i have dined
speed ay but hearken sir though the chameleon love can
 feed on the air i am one that am nourished by my

valentine tis indeed madam we thank the giver

thurio sir if you spend word for word with me i shall

duke know ye don antonio your countryman
valentine ay my good lord i know the gentleman
 to be of worth and worthy estimation
 and not without desert so well reputed
duke hath he not a son
valentine ay my good lord a son that well deserves
 the honour and regard of such a father
duke you know him well
valentine i know him as myself for from our infancy
 we have conversed and spent our hours together
 and though myself have been an idle truant
 omitting the sweet benefit of time
 to clothe mine age with angellike perfection
 yet hath sir proteus for that's his name
 made use and fair advantage of his days
 his years but young but his experience old
 his head unmellow'd but his judgment ripe
 and in a word for far behind his worth
 comes all the praises that i now bestow
 he is complete in feature and in mind
 with all good grace to grace a gentleman
duke beshrew me sir but if he make this good
 he is as worthy for an empress love
 as meet to be an emperor's counsellor
 well sir this gentleman is come to me
 with commendation from great potentates
 and here he means to spend his time awhile
 i think tis no unwelcome news to you
valentine should i have wish'd a thing it had been he
duke welcome him then according to his worth
 silvia i speak to you and you sir thurio
 for valentine i need not cite him to it
 i will send him hither to you presently
 exit
valentine this is the gentleman i told your ladyship
 had come along with me but that his mistress
 did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks
silvia belike that now she hath enfranchised them
 upon some other pawn for fealty
valentine nay sure i think she holds them prisoners still
silvia nay then he should be blind and being blind
 how could he see his way to seek out you
valentine why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes
thurio they say that love hath not an eye at all
valentine to see such lovers thurio as yourself
 upon a homely object love can wink
silvia have done have done here comes the gentleman
 exit thurio

 confirm his welcome with some special favour
silvia his worth is warrant for his welcome hither
 if this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from
valentine mistress it is sweet lady entertain him
 to be my fellowservant to your ladyship
silvia too low a mistress for so high a servant
proteus not so sweet lady but too mean a servant
 to have a look of such a worthy mistress
valentine leave off discourse of disability
 sweet lady entertain him for your servant
proteus my duty will i boast of nothing else
silvia and duty never yet did want his meed
 servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress
proteus i'll die on him that says so but yourself
silvia that you are welcome
proteus that you are worthless
 reenter thurio
thurio madam my lord your father would speak with you
silvia i wait upon his pleasure come sir thurio
 go with me once more new servant welcome
 i'll leave you to confer of home affairs
 when you have done we look to hear from you
proteus we'll both attend upon your ladyship
 exeunt silvia and thurio
valentine now tell me how do all from whence you came
proteus your friends are well and have them much commended
valentine and how do yours
proteus i left them all in health
valentine how does your lady and how thrives your love
proteus my tales of love were wont to weary you
 i know you joy not in a love discourse
valentine ay proteus but that life is alter'd now
 i have done penance for contemning love
 whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
 with bitter fasts with penitential groans
 with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs
 for in revenge of my contempt of love
 love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
 and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow
 o gentle proteus love's a mighty lord
 and hath so humbled me as i confess
 there is no woe to his correction
 nor to his service no such joy on earth
 now no discourse except it be of love
 now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep
 upon the very naked name of love
proteus enough i read your fortune in your eye
 was this the idol that you worship so
valentine even she and is she not a heavenly saint
proteus no but she is an earthly paragon
valentine call her divine
proteus i will not flatter her
valentine o flatter me for love delights in praises
proteus when i was sick you gave me bitter pills
 and i must minister the like to you
valentine then speak the truth by her if not divine
 yet let her be a principality
 sovereign to all the creatures on the earth
proteus except my mistress
valentine sweet except not any
 except thou wilt except against my love
proteus have i not reason to prefer mine own
valentine and i will help thee to prefer her too
 she shall be dignified with this high honour
 to bear my lady's train lest the base earth
 should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
 and of so great a favour growing proud
 disdain to root the summerswelling flower
 and make rough winter everlastingly
proteus why valentine what braggardism is this
valentine pardon me proteus all i can is nothing
 to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing
 she is alone
proteus then let her alone
valentine not for the world why man she is mine own
 and i as rich in having such a jewel
 as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl
 the water nectar and the rocks pure gold
 forgive me that i do not dream on thee
 because thou see'st me dote upon my love
 my foolish rival that her father likes
 only for his possessions are so huge
 is gone with her along and i must after
 for love thou know'st is full of jealousy
proteus but she loves you
valentine ay and we are betroth'd nay more our
 marriagehour
 with all the cunning manner of our flight
 determined of how i must climb her window
 the ladder made of cords and all the means
 plotted and greed on for my happiness
 good proteus go with me to my chamber
 in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel
proteus go on before i shall inquire you forth
 i must unto the road to disembark
 some necessaries that i needs must use
 and then i'll presently attend you
valentine will you make haste
proteus i will
 exit valentine
 even as one heat another heat expels
 or as one nail by strength drives out another
 so the remembrance of my former love
 is by a newer object quite forgotten
 is it mine or valentine's praise
 her true perfection or my false transgression
 that makes me reasonless to reason thus
 she is fair and so is julia that i love
 that i did love for now my love is thaw'd
 which like a waxen image gainst a fire
 bears no impression of the thing it was
 methinks my zeal to valentine is cold
 and that i love him not as i was wont
 o but i love his lady too too much
 and that's the reason i love him so little
 how shall i dote on her with more advice
 that thus without advice begin to love her
 tis but her picture i have yet beheld
 and that hath dazzled my reason's light
 but when i look on her perfections
 there is no reason but i shall be blind
 if i can cheque my erring love i will
 if not to compass her i'll use my skill

proteus to leave my julia shall i be forsworn
 to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn
 to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn
 and even that power which gave me first my oath
 provokes me to this threefold perjury
 love bade me swear and love bids me forswear
 o sweetsuggesting love if thou hast sinned
 teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
 at first i did adore a twinkling star
 but now i worship a celestial sun
 unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
 and he wants wit that wants resolved will
 to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better
 fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
 whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
 with twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths
 i cannot leave to love and yet i do
 but there i leave to love where i should love
 julia i lose and valentine i lose
 if i keep them i needs must lose myself
 if i lose them thus find i by their loss
 for valentine myself for julia silvia
 i to myself am dearer than a friend
 for love is still most precious in itself
 and silviawitness heaven that made her fair
 shows julia but a swarthy ethiope
 i will forget that julia is alive
 remembering that my love to her is dead
 and valentine i'll hold an enemy
 aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend
 i cannot now prove constant to myself
 without some treachery used to valentine
 this night he meaneth with a corded ladder
 to climb celestial silvia's chamberwindow
 myself in counsel his competitor
 now presently i'll give her father notice
 of their disguising and pretended flight
 who all enraged will banish valentine
 for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter

scene vii verona julia's house
 enter julia and lucetta
julia counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me
 and even in kind love i do conjure thee
 who art the table wherein all my thoughts
 are visibly character'd and engraved
 to lesson me and tell me some good mean
 how with my honour i may undertake
 a journey to my loving proteus
lucetta alas the way is wearisome and long
julia a truedevoted pilgrim is not weary
 to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
 much less shall she that hath love's wings to fly
 and when the flight is made to one so dear
 of such divine perfection as sir proteus
lucetta better forbear till proteus make return
julia o know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food
 pity the dearth that i have pined in
 by longing for that food so long a time
 didst thou but know the inly touch of love
 thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
 as seek to quench the fire of love with words
lucetta i do not seek to quench your love's hot fire
 but qualify the fire's extreme rage
 lest it should burn above the bounds of reason
julia the more thou damm'st it up the more it burns
 the current that with gentle murmur glides
 thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage
 but when his fair course is not hindered
 he makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones
 giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
 he overtaketh in his pilgrimage
 and so by many winding nooks he strays
 with willing sport to the wild ocean
 then let me go and hinder not my course
 i'll be as patient as a gentle stream
 and make a pastime of each weary step
 till the last step have brought me to my love
 and there i'll rest as after much turmoil
 a blessed soul doth in elysium
lucetta but in what habit will you go along
julia not like a woman for i would prevent
 the loose encounters of lascivious men
 gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds
 as may beseem some wellreputed page
lucetta why then your ladyship must cut your hair
julia no girl i'll knit it up in silken strings
 with twenty oddconceited truelove knots
 to be fantastic may become a youth
 of greater time than i shall show to be
lucetta what fashion madam shall i make your breeches
julia that fits as well as tell me good my lord
 what compass will you wear your farthingale'
 why even what fashion thou best likest lucetta
lucetta you must needs have them with a codpiece madam
julia out out lucetta that would be illfavour'd
lucetta a round hose madam now's not worth a pin
 unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on
julia lucetta as thou lovest me let me have
 what thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly
 but tell me wench how will the world repute me
 for undertaking so unstaid a journey
 i fear me it will make me scandalized
lucetta if you think so then stay at home and go not
julia nay that i will not
lucetta then never dream on infamy but go
 if proteus like your journey when you come
 no matter who's displeased when you are gone
 i fear me he will scarce be pleased withal
julia that is the least lucetta of my fear
 a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
 and instances of infinite of love
 warrant me welcome to my proteus
lucetta all these are servants to deceitful men
julia base men that use them to so base effect
 but truer stars did govern proteus birth
 his words are bonds his oaths are oracles
 his love sincere his thoughts immaculate
 his tears pure messengers sent from his heart
 his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth
lucetta pray heaven he prove so when you come to him
julia now as thou lovest me do him not that wrong
 to bear a hard opinion of his truth
 only deserve my love by loving him
 and presently go with me to my chamber
 to take a note of what i stand in need of
 to furnish me upon my longing journey
 all that is mine i leave at thy dispose
 my goods my lands my reputation
 only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
 come answer not but to it presently
 i am impatient of my tarriance

 the two gentlemen of verona
act iii
scene i milan the duke's palace
 enter duke thurio and proteus
duke sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile
 we have some secrets to confer about
 exit thurio
 now tell me proteus what's your will with me
proteus my gracious lord that which i would discover
 the law of friendship bids me to conceal
 but when i call to mind your gracious favours
 done to me undeserving as i am
 my duty pricks me on to utter that
 which else no worldly good should draw from me
 know worthy prince sir valentine my friend
 this night intends to steal away your daughter
 myself am one made privy to the plot
 i know you have determined to bestow her
 on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
 and should she thus be stol'n away from you
 it would be much vexation to your age
 thus for my duty's sake i rather chose
 to cross my friend in his intended drift
 than by concealing it heap on your head
 a pack of sorrows which would press you down
 being unprevented to your timeless grave
duke proteus i thank thee for thine honest care
 which to requite command me while i live
 this love of theirs myself have often seen
 haply when they have judged me fast asleep
 and oftentimes have purposed to forbid
 sir valentine her company and my court
 but fearing lest my jealous aim might err
 and so unworthily disgrace the man
 a rashness that i ever yet have shunn'd
 i gave him gentle looks thereby to find
 that which thyself hast now disclosed to me
 and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
 knowing that tender youth is soon suggested
 i nightly lodge her in an upper tower
 the key whereof myself have ever kept
 and thence she cannot be convey'd away
proteus know noble lord they have devised a mean
 how he her chamberwindow will ascend
 and with a corded ladder fetch her down
 for which the youthful lover now is gone
 and this way comes he with it presently
 where if it please you you may intercept him
 but good my lord do it so cunningly
 that my discovery be not aimed at
 for love of you not hate unto my friend
 hath made me publisher of this pretence
duke upon mine honour he shall never know
 that i had any light from thee of this
proteus adieu my lord sir valentine is coming
 exit
 enter valentine
duke sir valentine whither away so fast
valentine please it your grace there is a messenger
 that stays to bear my letters to my friends
 and i am going to deliver them
duke be they of much import
valentine the tenor of them doth but signify
 my health and happy being at your court
duke nay then no matter stay with me awhile
 i am to break with thee of some affairs
 that touch me near wherein thou must be secret
 tis not unknown to thee that i have sought
 to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter
valentine i know it well my lord and sure the match
 were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
 is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
 beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
 cannot your grace win her to fancy him
duke no trust me she is peevish sullen froward
 proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
 neither regarding that she is my child
 nor fearing me as if i were her father
 and may i say to thee this pride of hers
 upon advice hath drawn my love from her
 and where i thought the remnant of mine age
 should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty
 i now am full resolved to take a wife
 and turn her out to who will take her in
 then let her beauty be her weddingdower
 for me and my possessions she esteems not
valentine what would your grace have me to do in this
duke there is a lady in verona here
 whom i affect but she is nice and coy
 and nought esteems my aged eloquence
 now therefore would i have thee to my tutor
 for long agone i have forgot to court
 besides the fashion of the time is changed
 how and which way i may bestow myself
 to be regarded in her sunbright eye
valentine win her with gifts if she respect not words
 dumb jewels often in their silent kind
 more than quick words do move a woman's mind
duke but she did scorn a present that i sent her
valentine a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her
 send her another never give her o'er
 for scorn at first makes afterlove the more
 if she do frown tis not in hate of you
 but rather to beget more love in you
 if she do chide tis not to have you gone
 for why the fools are mad if left alone
 take no repulse whatever she doth say
 for get you gone she doth not mean away'
 flatter and praise commend extol their graces
 though ne'er so black say they have angels faces
 that man that hath a tongue i say is no man
 if with his tongue he cannot win a woman
duke but she i mean is promised by her friends
 unto a youthful gentleman of worth
 and kept severely from resort of men
 that no man hath access by day to her
valentine why then i would resort to her by night
duke ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe
 that no man hath recourse to her by night
valentine what lets but one may enter at her window
duke her chamber is aloft far from the ground
 and built so shelving that one cannot climb it
 without apparent hazard of his life
valentine why then a ladder quaintly made of cords
 to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
 would serve to scale another hero's tower
 so bold leander would adventure it
duke now as thou art a gentleman of blood
 advise me where i may have such a ladder
valentine when would you use it pray sir tell me that
duke this very night for love is like a child
 that longs for every thing that he can come by
valentine by seven o'clock i'll get you such a ladder
duke but hark thee i will go to her alone
 how shall i best convey the ladder thither
valentine it will be light my lord that you may bear it
 under a cloak that is of any length
duke a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
valentine ay my good lord
duke then let me see thy cloak
 i'll get me one of such another length
valentine why any cloak will serve the turn my lord
duke how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak
 i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me
 what letter is this same what's here to silvia'
 and here an engine fit for my proceeding
 i'll be so bold to break the seal for once
 reads
 my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly
 and slaves they are to me that send them flying
 o could their master come and go as lightly
 himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
 my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
 while i their king that hither them importune
 do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them
 because myself do want my servants fortune
 i curse myself for they are sent by me
 that they should harbour where their lord would be'
 what's here
 silvia this night i will enfranchise thee'
 tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose
 why phaetonfor thou art merops son
 wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
 and with thy daring folly burn the world
 wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
 go base intruder overweening slave
 bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
 and think my patience more than thy desert
 is privilege for thy departure hence
 thank me for this more than for all the favours
 which all too much i have bestow'd on thee
 but if thou linger in my territories
 longer than swiftest expedition
 will give thee time to leave our royal court
 by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
 i ever bore my daughter or thyself
 be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse
 but as thou lovest thy life make speed from hence
 exit
valentine and why not death rather than living torment
 to die is to be banish'd from myself
 and silvia is myself banish'd from her
 is self from self a deadly banishment
 what light is light if silvia be not seen
 what joy is joy if silvia be not by
 unless it be to think that she is by
 and feed upon the shadow of perfection
 except i be by silvia in the night
 there is no music in the nightingale
 unless i look on silvia in the day
 there is no day for me to look upon
 she is my essence and i leave to be
 if i be not by her fair influence
 foster'd illumined cherish'd kept alive
 i fly not death to fly his deadly doom
 tarry i here i but attend on death
 but fly i hence i fly away from life
 enter proteus and launce
proteus run boy run run and seek him out
launce soho soho
proteus what seest thou
launce him we go to find there's not a hair on's head
 but tis a valentine
proteus valentine
valentine no
proteus who then his spirit
valentine neither
proteus what then
valentine nothing
launce can nothing speak master shall i strike
proteus who wouldst thou strike
launce nothing
proteus villain forbear
launce why sir i'll strike nothing i pray you
proteus sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word
valentine my ears are stopt and cannot hear good news
 so much of bad already hath possess'd them
proteus then in dumb silence will i bury mine
 for they are harsh untuneable and bad
valentine is silvia dead
proteus no valentine
valentine no valentine indeed for sacred silvia
 hath she forsworn me
proteus no valentine
valentine no valentine if silvia have forsworn me
 what is your news
launce sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished
proteus that thou art banishedo that's the news
 from hence from silvia and from me thy friend
valentine o i have fed upon this woe already
 and now excess of it will make me surfeit
 doth silvia know that i am banished
proteus ay ay and she hath offer'd to the doom
 which unreversed stands in effectual force
 a sea of melting pearl which some call tears
 those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd
 with them upon her knees her humble self
 wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
 as if but now they waxed pale for woe
 but neither bended knees pure hands held up
 sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears
 could penetrate her uncompassionate sire
 but valentine if he be ta'en must die
 besides her intercession chafed him so
 when she for thy repeal was suppliant
 that to close prison he commanded her
 with many bitter threats of biding there
valentine no more unless the next word that thou speak'st
 have some malignant power upon my life
 if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear
 as ending anthem of my endless dolour
proteus cease to lament for that thou canst not help
 and study help for that which thou lament'st
 time is the nurse and breeder of all good
 here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love
 besides thy staying will abridge thy life
 hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that
 and manage it against despairing thoughts
 thy letters may be here though thou art hence
 which being writ to me shall be deliver'd
 even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love
 the time now serves not to expostulate
 come i'll convey thee through the citygate
 and ere i part with thee confer at large
 of all that may concern thy loveaffairs
 as thou lovest silvia though not for thyself

act iii
scene ii the same the duke's palace
 enter duke and thurio
duke sir thurio fear not but that she will love you
 now valentine is banish'd from her sight
thurio since his exile she hath despised me most
 forsworn my company and rail'd at me
 that i am desperate of obtaining her
duke this weak impress of love is as a figure
 trenched in ice which with an hour's heat
 dissolves to water and doth lose his form
 a little time will melt her frozen thoughts
 and worthless valentine shall be forgot
 enter proteus
 how now sir proteus is your countryman
 according to our proclamation gone
proteus gone my good lord
duke my daughter takes his going grievously
proteus a little time my lord will kill that grief
duke so i believe but thurio thinks not so
 proteus the good conceit i hold of thee
 for thou hast shown some sign of good desert
 makes me the better to confer with thee
proteus longer than i prove loyal to your grace
 let me not live to look upon your grace
duke thou know'st how willingly i would effect
 the match between sir thurio and my daughter
proteus i do my lord
duke and also i think thou art not ignorant
 how she opposes her against my will
proteus she did my lord when valentine was here
duke ay and perversely she persevers so
 what might we do to make the girl forget
 the love of valentine and love sir thurio
proteus the best way is to slander valentine
 with falsehood cowardice and poor descent
 three things that women highly hold in hate
duke ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate
proteus ay if his enemy deliver it
 therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
 by one whom she esteemeth as his friend
duke then you must undertake to slander him
proteus and that my lord i shall be loath to do
 tis an ill office for a gentleman
 especially against his very friend
duke where your good word cannot advantage him
 your slander never can endamage him
 therefore the office is indifferent
 being entreated to it by your friend
proteus you have prevail'd my lord if i can do it
 by ought that i can speak in his dispraise
 she shall not long continue love to him
 but say this weed her love from valentine
 it follows not that she will love sir thurio
thurio therefore as you unwind her love from him
 lest it should ravel and be good to none
 you must provide to bottom it on me
 which must be done by praising me as much
 as you in worth dispraise sir valentine
duke and proteus we dare trust you in this kind
 because we know on valentine's report
 you are already love's firm votary
 and cannot soon revolt and change your mind
 upon this warrant shall you have access
 where you with silvia may confer at large
 for she is lumpish heavy melancholy
 and for your friend's sake will be glad of you
 where you may temper her by your persuasion
 to hate young valentine and love my friend
proteus as much as i can do i will effect
 but you sir thurio are not sharp enough
 you must lay lime to tangle her desires
 by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes
 should be fullfraught with serviceable vows
duke ay
 much is the force of heavenbred poesy
proteus say that upon the altar of her beauty
 you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart
 write till your ink be dry and with your tears
 moist it again and frame some feeling line
 that may discover such integrity
 for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews
 whose golden touch could soften steel and stones
 make tigers tame and huge leviathans
 forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
 after your direlamenting elegies
 visit by night your lady's chamberwindow
 with some sweet concert to their instruments
 tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence
 will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance
 this or else nothing will inherit her
duke this discipline shows thou hast been in love
thurio and thy advice this night i'll put in practise
 therefore sweet proteus my directiongiver
 let us into the city presently
 to sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music
 i have a sonnet that will serve the turn
 to give the onset to thy good advice
duke about it gentlemen
proteus we'll wait upon your grace till after supper
 and afterward determine our proceedings
duke even now about it i will pardon you

scene i the frontiers of mantua a forest
 enter certain outlaws
first outlaw fellows stand fast i see a passenger
second outlaw if there be ten shrink not but down with em
 enter valentine and speed
third outlaw stand sir and throw us that you have about ye
 if not we'll make you sit and rifle you
speed sir we are undone these are the villains
 that all the travellers do fear so much
valentine my friends
first outlaw that's not so sir we are your enemies
second outlaw peace we'll hear him
third outlaw ay by my beard will we for he's a proper man
valentine then know that i have little wealth to lose
 a man i am cross'd with adversity
 my riches are these poor habiliments
 of which if you should here disfurnish me
 you take the sum and substance that i have
second outlaw whither travel you
valentine to verona
first outlaw whence came you
valentine from milan
third outlaw have you long sojourned there
valentine some sixteen months and longer might have stay'd
 if crooked fortune had not thwarted me
first outlaw what were you banish'd thence
valentine i was
second outlaw for what offence
valentine for that which now torments me to rehearse
 i kill'd a man whose death i much repent
 but yet i slew him manfully in fight
 without false vantage or base treachery
first outlaw why ne'er repent it if it were done so
 but were you banish'd for so small a fault
valentine i was and held me glad of such a doom
second outlaw have you the tongues
valentine my youthful travel therein made me happy
 or else i often had been miserable
third outlaw by the bare scalp of robin hood's fat friar
 this fellow were a king for our wild faction
first outlaw we'll have him sirs a word
speed master be one of them it's an honourable kind of thievery
valentine peace villain
second outlaw tell us this have you any thing to take to
valentine nothing but my fortune
third outlaw know then that some of us are gentlemen
 such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
 thrust from the company of awful men
 myself was from verona banished
 for practising to steal away a lady
 an heir and near allied unto the duke
second outlaw and i from mantua for a gentleman
 who in my mood i stabb'd unto the heart
first outlaw and i for such like petty crimes as these
 but to the purposefor we cite our faults
 that they may hold excus'd our lawless lives
 and partly seeing you are beautified
 with goodly shape and by your own report
 a linguist and a man of such perfection
 as we do in our quality much want
second outlaw indeed because you are a banish'd man
 therefore above the rest we parley to you
 are you content to be our general
 to make a virtue of necessity
 and live as we do in this wilderness
third outlaw what say'st thou wilt thou be of our consort
 say ay and be the captain of us all
 we'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee
 love thee as our commander and our king
first outlaw but if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest
second outlaw thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd
valentine i take your offer and will live with you
 provided that you do no outrages
 on silly women or poor passengers
third outlaw no we detest such vile base practises
 come go with us we'll bring thee to our crews
 and show thee all the treasure we have got
 which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose

act iv
scene ii milan outside the duke's palace under silvia's chamber
 enter proteus
proteus already have i been false to valentine
 and now i must be as unjust to thurio
 under the colour of commending him
 i have access my own love to prefer
 but silvia is too fair too true too holy
 to be corrupted with my worthless gifts
 when i protest true loyalty to her
 she twits me with my falsehood to my friend
 when to her beauty i commend my vows
 she bids me think how i have been forsworn
 in breaking faith with julia whom i loved
 and notwithstanding all her sudden quips
 the least whereof would quell a lover's hope
 yet spaniellike the more she spurns my love
 the more it grows and fawneth on her still
 but here comes thurio now must we to her window
 and give some evening music to her ear
 enter thurio and musicians
thurio how now sir proteus are you crept before us
proteus ay gentle thurio for you know that love
 will creep in service where it cannot go
thurio ay but i hope sir that you love not here
proteus sir but i do or else i would be hence
thurio who silvia
proteus ay silvia for your sake
thurio i thank you for your own now gentlemen
 let's tune and to it lustily awhile
 enter at a distance host and julia in boy's clothes
host now my young guest methinks you're allycholly i
 pray you why is it
julia marry mine host because i cannot be merry
host come we'll have you merry i'll bring you where
 you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for
julia but shall i hear him speak
host ay that you shall
julia that will be music
 music plays
host hark hark
julia is he among these
host ay but peace let's hear em
 song
 who is silvia what is she
 that all our swains commend her
 holy fair and wise is she
 the heaven such grace did lend her
 that she might admired be
 is she kind as she is fair
 for beauty lives with kindness
 love doth to her eyes repair
 to help him of his blindness
 and being help'd inhabits there
 then to silvia let us sing
 that silvia is excelling
 she excels each mortal thing
 upon the dull earth dwelling
 to her let us garlands bring
host how now are you sadder than you were before how
 do you man the music likes you not
julia you mistake the musician likes me not
host why my pretty youth
julia he plays false father
host how out of tune on the strings
julia not so but yet so false that he grieves my very
 heartstrings
host you have a quick ear
julia ay i would i were deaf it makes me have a slow heart
host i perceive you delight not in music
julia not a whit when it jars so
host hark what fine change is in the music
julia ay that change is the spite
host you would have them always play but one thing
julia i would always have one play but one thing
 but host doth this sir proteus that we talk on
 often resort unto this gentlewoman
host i tell you what launce his man told me he loved
 her out of all nick
julia where is launce
host gone to seek his dog which tomorrow by his
 master's command he must carry for a present to his lady
julia peace stand aside the company parts
proteus sir thurio fear not you i will so plead
 that you shall say my cunning drift excels
thurio where meet we
proteus at saint gregory's well
thurio farewell
 exeunt thurio and musicians
 enter silvia above
proteus madam good even to your ladyship
silvia i thank you for your music gentlemen
 who is that that spake
proteus one lady if you knew his pure heart's truth
 you would quickly learn to know him by his voice
silvia sir proteus as i take it
proteus sir proteus gentle lady and your servant
silvia what's your will
proteus that i may compass yours
silvia you have your wish my will is even this
 that presently you hie you home to bed
 thou subtle perjured false disloyal man
 think'st thou i am so shallow so conceitless
 to be seduced by thy flattery
 that hast deceived so many with thy vows
 return return and make thy love amends
 for me by this pale queen of night i swear
 i am so far from granting thy request
 that i despise thee for thy wrongful suit
 and by and by intend to chide myself
 even for this time i spend in talking to thee
proteus i grant sweet love that i did love a lady
 but she is dead
julia aside twere false if i should speak it
 for i am sure she is not buried
silvia say that she be yet valentine thy friend
 survives to whom thyself art witness
 i am betroth'd and art thou not ashamed
 to wrong him with thy importunacy
proteus i likewise hear that valentine is dead
silvia and so suppose am i for in his grave
 assure thyself my love is buried
proteus sweet lady let me rake it from the earth
silvia go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence
 or at the least in hers sepulchre thine
julia aside he heard not that
proteus madam if your heart be so obdurate
 vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love
 the picture that is hanging in your chamber
 to that i'll speak to that i'll sigh and weep
 for since the substance of your perfect self
 is else devoted i am but a shadow
 and to your shadow will i make true love
julia aside if twere a substance you would sure
 deceive it
 and make it but a shadow as i am
silvia i am very loath to be your idol sir
 but since your falsehood shall become you well
 to worship shadows and adore false shapes
 send to me in the morning and i'll send it
 and so good rest
proteus as wretches have o'ernight
 that wait for execution in the morn
 exeunt proteus and silvia severally
julia host will you go
host by my halidom i was fast asleep
julia pray you where lies sir proteus
host marry at my house trust me i think tis almost
 day
julia not so but it hath been the longest night
 that e'er i watch'd and the most heaviest

eglamour this is the hour that madam silvia
 entreated me to call and know her mind
 there's some great matter she'ld employ me in
 madam madam
 enter silvia above
silvia who calls
eglamour your servant and your friend
 one that attends your ladyship's command
silvia sir eglamour a thousand times good morrow
eglamour as many worthy lady to yourself
 according to your ladyship's impose
 i am thus early come to know what service
 it is your pleasure to command me in
silvia o eglamour thou art a gentleman
 think not i flatter for i swear i do not
 valiant wise remorseful well accomplish'd
 thou art not ignorant what dear good will
 i bear unto the banish'd valentine
 nor how my father would enforce me marry
 vain thurio whom my very soul abhors
 thyself hast loved and i have heard thee say
 no grief did ever come so near thy heart
 as when thy lady and thy true love died
 upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity
 sir eglamour i would to valentine
 to mantua where i hear he makes abode
 and for the ways are dangerous to pass
 i do desire thy worthy company
 upon whose faith and honour i repose
 urge not my father's anger eglamour
 but think upon my grief a lady's grief
 and on the justice of my flying hence
 to keep me from a most unholy match
 which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues
 i do desire thee even from a heart
 as full of sorrows as the sea of sands
 to bear me company and go with me
 if not to hide what i have said to thee
 that i may venture to depart alone
eglamour madam i pity much your grievances
 which since i know they virtuously are placed
 i give consent to go along with you
 recking as little what betideth me
 as much i wish all good befortune you
 when will you go

act iv
scene iv the same
 enter launce with his his dog
launce when a man's servant shall play the cur with him
 look you it goes hard one that i brought up of a
 puppy one that i saved from drowning when three or
 four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it
 i have taught him even as one would say precisely
 thus i would teach a dog i was sent to deliver
 him as a present to mistress silvia from my master
 and i came no sooner into the diningchamber but he
 steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg
 o tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
 in all companies i would have as one should say
 one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be
 as it were a dog at all things if i had not had
 more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did
 i think verily he had been hanged for't sure as i
 live he had suffered for't you shall judge he
 thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
 gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table he had
 not been therebless the marka pissing while but
 all the chamber smelt him out with the dog says
 one what cur is that says another whip him
 out says the third hang him up says the duke
 i having been acquainted with the smell before
 knew it was crab and goes me to the fellow that
 whips the dogs friend quoth i you mean to whip
 the dog ay marry do i quoth he you do him
 the more wrong quoth i 'twas i did the thing you
 wot of he makes me no more ado but whips me out
 of the chamber how many masters would do this for
 his servant nay i'll be sworn i have sat in the
 stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had
 been executed i have stood on the pillory for geese
 he hath killed otherwise he had suffered for't
 thou thinkest not of this now nay i remember the
 trick you served me when i took my leave of madam
 silvia did not i bid thee still mark me and do as i
 do when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
 water against a gentlewoman's farthingale didst
 thou ever see me do such a trick
 enter proteus and julia
proteus sebastian is thy name i like thee well
 and will employ thee in some service presently
julia in what you please i'll do what i can
proteus i hope thou wilt
 to launce
 how now you whoreson peasant
 where have you been these two days loitering
launce marry sir i carried mistress silvia the dog you bade me
proteus and what says she to my little jewel
launce marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you
 currish thanks is good enough for such a present
proteus but she received my dog
launce no indeed did she not here have i brought him
 back again
proteus what didst thou offer her this from me
launce ay sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by
 the hangman boys in the marketplace and then i
 offered her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of
 yours and therefore the gift the greater
proteus go get thee hence and find my dog again
 or ne'er return again into my sight
 away i say stay'st thou to vex me here
 exit launce
 a slave that still an end turns me to shame
 sebastian i have entertained thee
 partly that i have need of such a youth
 that can with some discretion do my business
 for tis no trusting to yond foolish lout
 but chiefly for thy face and thy behavior
 which if my augury deceive me not
 witness good bringing up fortune and truth
 therefore know thou for this i entertain thee
 go presently and take this ring with thee
 deliver it to madam silvia
 she loved me well deliver'd it to me
julia it seems you loved not her to leave her token
 she is dead belike
proteus not so i think she lives
julia alas
proteus why dost thou cry alas'
julia i cannot choose
 but pity her
proteus wherefore shouldst thou pity her
julia because methinks that she loved you as well
 as you do love your lady silvia
 she dreams of him that has forgot her love
 you dote on her that cares not for your love
 tis pity love should be so contrary
 and thinking of it makes me cry alas'
proteus well give her that ring and therewithal
 this letter that's her chamber tell my lady
 i claim the promise for her heavenly picture
 your message done hie home unto my chamber
 where thou shalt find me sad and solitary
 exit
julia how many women would do such a message
 alas poor proteus thou hast entertain'd
 a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs
 alas poor fool why do i pity him
 that with his very heart despiseth me
 because he loves her he despiseth me
 because i love him i must pity him
 this ring i gave him when he parted from me
 to bind him to remember my good will
 and now am i unhappy messenger
 to plead for that which i would not obtain
 to carry that which i would have refused
 to praise his faith which i would have dispraised
 i am my master's trueconfirmed love
 but cannot be true servant to my master
 unless i prove false traitor to myself
 yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly
 as heaven it knows i would not have him speed
 enter silvia attended
 gentlewoman good day i pray you be my mean
 to bring me where to speak with madam silvia
silvia what would you with her if that i be she
julia if you be she i do entreat your patience
 to hear me speak the message i am sent on
silvia from whom
julia from my master sir proteus madam
silvia o he sends you for a picture
julia ay madam
silvia ursula bring my picture here
 go give your master this tell him from me
 one julia that his changing thoughts forget
 would better fit his chamber than this shadow
julia madam please you peruse this letter
 pardon me madam i have unadvised
 deliver'd you a paper that i should not
 this is the letter to your ladyship
silvia i pray thee let me look on that again
julia it may not be good madam pardon me
silvia there hold
 i will not look upon your master's lines
 i know they are stuff'd with protestations
 and full of newfound oaths which he will break
 as easily as i do tear his paper
julia madam he sends your ladyship this ring
silvia the more shame for him that he sends it me
 for i have heard him say a thousand times
 his julia gave it him at his departure
 though his false finger have profaned the ring
 mine shall not do his julia so much wrong
julia she thanks you
silvia what say'st thou
julia i thank you madam that you tender her
 poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
silvia dost thou know her
julia almost as well as i do know myself
 to think upon her woes i do protest
 that i have wept a hundred several times
silvia belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her
julia i think she doth and that's her cause of sorrow
silvia is she not passing fair
julia she hath been fairer madam than she is
 when she did think my master loved her well
 she in my judgment was as fair as you
 but since she did neglect her lookingglass
 and threw her sunexpelling mask away
 the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
 and pinch'd the lilytincture of her face
 that now she is become as black as i
silvia how tall was she
julia about my stature for at pentecost
 when all our pageants of delight were play'd
 our youth got me to play the woman's part
 and i was trimm'd in madam julia's gown
 which served me as fit by all men's judgments
 as if the garment had been made for me
 therefore i know she is about my height
 and at that time i made her weep agood
 for i did play a lamentable part
 madam twas ariadne passioning
 for theseus perjury and unjust flight
 which i so lively acted with my tears
 that my poor mistress moved therewithal
 wept bitterly and would i might be dead
 if i in thought felt not her very sorrow
silvia she is beholding to thee gentle youth
 alas poor lady desolate and left
 i weep myself to think upon thy words
 here youth there is my purse i give thee this
 for thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovest her
 farewell
 exit silvia with attendants
julia and she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her
 a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
 i hope my master's suit will be but cold
 since she respects my mistress love so much
 alas how love can trifle with itself
 here is her picture let me see i think
 if i had such a tire this face of mine
 were full as lovely as is this of hers
 and yet the painter flatter'd her a little
 unless i flatter with myself too much
 her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
 if that be all the difference in his love
 i'll get me such a colour'd periwig
 her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine
 ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high
 what should it be that he respects in her
 but i can make respective in myself
 if this fond love were not a blinded god
 come shadow come and take this shadow up
 for tis thy rival o thou senseless form
 thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd loved and adored
 and were there sense in his idolatry
 my substance should be statue in thy stead
 i'll use thee kindly for thy mistress sake
 that used me so or else by jove i vow
 i should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
 to make my master out of love with thee

scene ii the same the duke's palace
 enter thurio proteus and julia
thurio sir proteus what says silvia to my suit
proteus o sir i find her milder than she was
 and yet she takes exceptions at your person
thurio what that my leg is too long
proteus no that it is too little
thurio i'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder
julia aside but love will not be spurr'd to what
 it loathes
thurio what says she to my face
proteus she says it is a fair one
thurio nay then the wanton lies my face is black
proteus but pearls are fair and the old saying is
 black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes
julia aside tis true such pearls as put out
 ladies eyes
 for i had rather wink than look on them
thurio how likes she my discourse
proteus ill when you talk of war
thurio but well when i discourse of love and peace
julia aside but better indeed when you hold your peace
thurio what says she to my valour
proteus o sir she makes no doubt of that
julia aside she needs not when she knows it cowardice
thurio what says she to my birth
proteus that you are well derived
julia aside true from a gentleman to a fool
thurio considers she my possessions
proteus o ay and pities them
thurio wherefore
julia aside that such an ass should owe them
proteus that they are out by lease
julia here comes the duke
 enter duke
duke how now sir proteus how now thurio
 which of you saw sir eglamour of late
thurio not i
proteus nor i
duke saw you my daughter
proteus neither
duke why then
 she's fled unto that peasant valentine
 and eglamour is in her company
 tis true for friar laurence met them both
 as he in penance wander'd through the forest
 him he knew well and guess'd that it was she
 but being mask'd he was not sure of it
 besides she did intend confession
 at patrick's cell this even and there she was not
 these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
 therefore i pray you stand not to discourse
 but mount you presently and meet with me
 upon the rising of the mountainfoot
 that leads towards mantua whither they are fled
 dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me
 exit
thurio why this it is to be a peevish girl
 that flies her fortune when it follows her
 i'll after more to be revenged on eglamour
 than for the love of reckless silvia
 exit
proteus and i will follow more for silvia's love
 than hate of eglamour that goes with her
 exit
julia and i will follow more to cross that love
 than hate for silvia that is gone for love
 exit

silvia a thousand more mischances than this one

second outlaw come bring her away
first outlaw where is the gentleman that was with her
third outlaw being nimblefooted he hath outrun us
 but moyses and valerius follow him
 go thou with her to the west end of the wood
 there is our captain we'll follow him that's fled
 the thicket is beset he cannot scape
first outlaw come i must bring you to our captain's cave
 fear not he bears an honourable mind
 and will not use a woman lawlessly
silvia o valentine this i endure for thee

 the two gentlemen of verona
act v
scene iv another part of the forest
 enter valentine
valentine how use doth breed a habit in a man
 this shadowy desert unfrequented woods
 i better brook than flourishing peopled towns
 here can i sit alone unseen of any
 and to the nightingale's complaining notes
 tune my distresses and record my woes
 o thou that dost inhabit in my breast
 leave not the mansion so long tenantless
 lest growing ruinous the building fall
 and leave no memory of what it was
 repair me with thy presence silvia
 thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain
 what halloing and what stir is this today
 these are my mates that make their wills their law
 have some unhappy passenger in chase
 they love me well yet i have much to do
 to keep them from uncivil outrages
 withdraw thee valentine who's this comes here
 enter proteus silvia and julia
proteus madam this service i have done for you
 though you respect not aught your servant doth
 to hazard life and rescue you from him
 that would have forced your honour and your love
 vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
 a smaller boon than this i cannot beg
 and less than this i am sure you cannot give
valentine aside how like a dream is this i see and hear
 love lend me patience to forbear awhile
silvia o miserable unhappy that i am
proteus unhappy were you madam ere i came
 but by my coming i have made you happy
silvia by thy approach thou makest me most unhappy
julia aside and me when he approacheth to your presence
silvia had i been seized by a hungry lion
 i would have been a breakfast to the beast
 rather than have false proteus rescue me
 o heaven be judge how i love valentine
 whose life's as tender to me as my soul
 and full as much for more there cannot be
 i do detest false perjured proteus
 therefore be gone solicit me no more
proteus what dangerous action stood it next to death
 would i not undergo for one calm look
 o tis the curse in love and still approved
 when women cannot love where they're beloved
silvia when proteus cannot love where he's beloved
 read over julia's heart thy first best love
 for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
 into a thousand oaths and all those oaths
 descended into perjury to love me
 thou hast no faith left now unless thou'dst two
 and that's far worse than none better have none
 than plural faith which is too much by one
 thou counterfeit to thy true friend
proteus in love
 who respects friend
silvia all men but proteus
proteus nay if the gentle spirit of moving words
 can no way change you to a milder form
 i'll woo you like a soldier at arms end
 and love you gainst the nature of loveforce ye
silvia o heaven
proteus i'll force thee yield to my desire
valentine ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch
 thou friend of an ill fashion
proteus valentine
valentine thou common friend that's without faith or love
 for such is a friend now treacherous man
 thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye
 could have persuaded me now i dare not say
 i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me
 who should be trusted when one's own right hand
 is perjured to the bosom proteus
 i am sorry i must never trust thee more
 but count the world a stranger for thy sake
 the private wound is deepest o time most accurst
 mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
proteus my shame and guilt confounds me
 forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow
 be a sufficient ransom for offence
 i tender t here i do as truly suffer
 as e'er i did commit
valentine then i am paid
 and once again i do receive thee honest
 who by repentance is not satisfied
 is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased
 by penitence the eternal's wrath's appeased
 and that my love may appear plain and free
 all that was mine in silvia i give thee
julia o me unhappy
 swoons
proteus look to the boy
valentine why boy why wag how now what's the matter
 look up speak
julia o good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring
 to madam silvia which out of my neglect was never done
proteus where is that ring boy
julia here tis this is it
proteus how let me see
 why this is the ring i gave to julia
julia o cry you mercy sir i have mistook
 this is the ring you sent to silvia
proteus but how camest thou by this ring at my depart
 i gave this unto julia
julia and julia herself did give it me
 and julia herself hath brought it hither
proteus how julia
julia behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
 and entertain'd em deeply in her heart
 how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
 o proteus let this habit make thee blush
 be thou ashamed that i have took upon me
 such an immodest raiment if shame live
 in a disguise of love
 it is the lesser blot modesty finds
 women to change their shapes than men their minds
proteus than men their minds tis true
 o heaven were man
 but constant he were perfect that one error
 fills him with faults makes him run through all the sins
 inconstancy falls off ere it begins
 what is in silvia's face but i may spy
 more fresh in julia's with a constant eye
valentine come come a hand from either
 let me be blest to make this happy close
 twere pity two such friends should be long foes
proteus bear witness heaven i have my wish for ever
julia and i mine
 enter outlaws with duke and thurio
outlaws a prize a prize a prize
valentine forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke
 your grace is welcome to a man disgraced
 banished valentine
duke sir valentine
thurio yonder is silvia and silvia's mine
valentine thurio give back or else embrace thy death
 come not within the measure of my wrath
 do not name silvia thine if once again
 verona shall not hold thee here she stands
 take but possession of her with a touch
 i dare thee but to breathe upon my love
thurio sir valentine i care not for her i
 i hold him but a fool that will endanger
 his body for a girl that loves him not
 i claim her not and therefore she is thine
duke the more degenerate and base art thou
 to make such means for her as thou hast done
 and leave her on such slight conditions
 now by the honour of my ancestry
 i do applaud thy spirit valentine
 and think thee worthy of an empress love
 know then i here forget all former griefs
 cancel all grudge repeal thee home again
 plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit
 to which i thus subscribe sir valentine
 thou art a gentleman and well derived
 take thou thy silvia for thou hast deserved her
valentine i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy
 i now beseech you for your daughter's sake
 to grant one boom that i shall ask of you
duke i grant it for thine own whate'er it be
valentine these banish'd men that i have kept withal
 are men endued with worthy qualities
 forgive them what they have committed here
 and let them be recall'd from their exile
 they are reformed civil full of good
 and fit for great employment worthy lord
duke thou hast prevail'd i pardon them and thee
 dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts
 come let us go we will include all jars
 with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity
valentine and as we walk along i dare be bold
 with our discourse to make your grace to smile
 what think you of this page my lord
duke i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes
valentine i warrant you my lord more grace than boy
duke what mean you by that saying
valentine please you i'll tell you as we pass along
 that you will wonder what hath fortuned
 come proteus tis your penance but to hear
 the story of your loves discovered
 that done our day of marriage shall be yours
 one feast one house one mutual happiness

scene i antechamber in leontes palace
 enter camillo and archidamus
archidamus if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on
 the like occasion whereon my services are now on
 foot you shall see as i have said great
 difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia
camillo i think this coming summer the king of sicilia
 means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
archidamus wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
 justified in our loves for indeed
camillo beseech you
archidamus verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge
 we cannot with such magnificencein so rarei know
 not what to say we will give you sleepy drinks
 that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience
 may though they cannot praise us as little accuse
 us
camillo you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely
archidamus believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me
 and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
camillo sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia
 they were trained together in their childhoods and
 there rooted betwixt them then such an affection
 which cannot choose but branch now since their
 more mature dignities and royal necessities made
 separation of their society their encounters
 though not personal have been royally attorneyed
 with interchange of gifts letters loving
 embassies that they have seemed to be together
 though absent shook hands as over a vast and
 embraced as it were from the ends of opposed
 winds the heavens continue their loves
archidamus i think there is not in the world either malice or
 matter to alter it you have an unspeakable
 comfort of your young prince mamillius it is a
 gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
 into my note
camillo i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it
 is a gallant child one that indeed physics the
 subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on
 crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
 see him a man
archidamus would they else be content to die
camillo yes if there were no other excuse why they should
 desire to live
archidamus if the king had no son they would desire to live
 on crutches till he had one

 polixenes camillo and attendants
polixenes nine changes of the watery star hath been
 the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
 without a burthen time as long again
 would be find up my brother with our thanks
 and yet we should for perpetuity
 go hence in debt and therefore like a cipher
 yet standing in rich place i multiply
 with one we thank you many thousands moe
 that go before it
leontes stay your thanks a while
 and pay them when you part
polixenes sir that's tomorrow
 i am question'd by my fears of what may chance
 or breed upon our absence that may blow
 no sneaping winds at home to make us say
 this is put forth too truly besides i have stay'd
 to tire your royalty
leontes we are tougher brother
 than you can put us to't
polixenes no longer stay
leontes one sevennight longer
polixenes very sooth tomorrow
leontes we'll part the time between's then and in that
 i'll no gainsaying
polixenes press me not beseech you so
 there is no tongue that moves none none i the world
 so soon as yours could win me so it should now
 were there necessity in your request although
 twere needful i denied it my affairs
 do even drag me homeward which to hinder
 were in your love a whip to me my stay
 to you a charge and trouble to save both
 farewell our brother
leontes tonguetied our queen
 speak you
hermione i had thought sir to have held my peace until
 you have drawn oaths from him not to stay you sir
 charge him too coldly tell him you are sure
 all in bohemia's well this satisfaction
 the bygone day proclaim'd say this to him
 he's beat from his best ward
leontes well said hermione
hermione to tell he longs to see his son were strong
 but let him say so then and let him go
 but let him swear so and he shall not stay
 we'll thwack him hence with distaffs
 yet of your royal presence i'll adventure
 the borrow of a week when at bohemia
 you take my lord i'll give him my commission
 to let him there a month behind the gest
 prefix'd for's parting yet good deed leontes
 i love thee not a jar o the clock behind
 what ladyshe her lord you'll stay
polixenes no madam
hermione nay but you will
polixenes i may not verily
hermione verily
 you put me off with limber vows but i
 though you would seek to unsphere the
 stars with oaths
 should yet say sir no going verily
 you shall not go a lady's verily s
 as potent as a lord's will you go yet
 force me to keep you as a prisoner
 not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
 when you depart and save your thanks how say you
 my prisoner or my guest by your dread verily'
 one of them you shall be
polixenes your guest then madam
 to be your prisoner should import offending
 which is for me less easy to commit
 than you to punish
hermione not your gaoler then
 but your kind hostess come i'll question you
 of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys
 you were pretty lordings then
polixenes we were fair queen
 two lads that thought there was no more behind
 but such a day tomorrow as today
 and to be boy eternal
hermione was not my lord
 the verier wag o the two
polixenes we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i the sun
 and bleat the one at the other what we changed
 was innocence for innocence we knew not
 the doctrine of illdoing nor dream'd
 that any did had we pursued that life
 and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
 with stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven
 boldly not guilty the imposition clear'd
 hereditary ours
hermione by this we gather
 you have tripp'd since
polixenes o my most sacred lady
 temptations have since then been born to's for
 in those unfledged days was my wife a girl
 your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
 of my young playfellow
hermione grace to boot
 of this make no conclusion lest you say
 your queen and i are devils yet go on
 the offences we have made you do we'll answer
 if you first sinn'd with us and that with us
 you did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
 with any but with us
leontes is he won yet
hermione he'll stay my lord
leontes at my request he would not
 hermione my dearest thou never spokest
 to better purpose
hermione never
leontes never but once
hermione what have i twice said well when was't before
 i prithee tell me cram's with praise and make's
 as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless
 slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
 our praises are our wages you may ride's
 with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
 with spur we beat an acre but to the goal
 my last good deed was to entreat his stay
 what was my first it has an elder sister
 or i mistake you o would her name were grace
 but once before i spoke to the purpose when
 nay let me have't i long
leontes why that was when
 three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death
 ere i could make thee open thy white hand
 and clap thyself my love then didst thou utter
 i am yours for ever'
hermione tis grace indeed
 why lo you now i have spoke to the purpose twice
 the one for ever earn'd a royal husband
 the other for some while a friend
leontes aside too hot too hot
 to mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
 i have tremor cordis on me my heart dances
 but not for joy not joy this entertainment
 may a free face put on derive a liberty
 from heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
 and well become the agent t may i grant
 but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers
 as now they are and making practised smiles
 as in a lookingglass and then to sigh as twere
 the mort o the deer o that is entertainment
 my bosom likes not nor my brows mamillius
 art thou my boy
mamillius ay my good lord
leontes i fecks
 why that's my bawcock what hast
 smutch'd thy nose
 they say it is a copy out of mine come captain
 we must be neat not neat but cleanly captain
 and yet the steer the heifer and the calf
 are all call'd neatstill virginalling
 upon his palmhow now you wanton calf
 art thou my calf
mamillius yes if you will my lord
leontes thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that i have
 to be full like me yet they say we are
 almost as like as eggs women say so
 that will say anything but were they false
 as o'erdyed blacks as wind as waters false
 as dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
 no bourn twixt his and mine yet were it true
 to say this boy were like me come sir page
 look on me with your welkin eye sweet villain
 most dear'st my collop can thy dammay't be
 affection thy intention stabs the centre
 thou dost make possible things not so held
 communicatest with dreamshow can this be
 with what's unreal thou coactive art
 and fellow'st nothing then tis very credent
 thou mayst cojoin with something and thou dost
 and that beyond commission and i find it
 and that to the infection of my brains
 and hardening of my brows

hermione he something seems unsettled
polixenes how my lord
 what cheer how is't with you best brother
hermione you look as if you held a brow of much distraction
 are you moved my lord
leontes no in good earnest
 how sometimes nature will betray its folly
 its tenderness and make itself a pastime
 to harder bosoms looking on the lines
 of my boy's face methoughts i did recoil
 twentythree years and saw myself unbreech'd
 in my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled
 lest it should bite its master and so prove
 as ornaments oft do too dangerous
 how like methought i then was to this kernel
 this squash this gentleman mine honest friend
 will you take eggs for money
mamillius no my lord i'll fight
leontes you will why happy man be's dole my brother
 are you so fond of your young prince as we
 do seem to be of ours
polixenes if at home sir
 he's all my exercise my mirth my matter
 now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
 my parasite my soldier statesman all
 he makes a july's day short as december
 and with his varying childness cures in me
 thoughts that would thick my blood
leontes so stands this squire
 officed with me we two will walk my lord
 and leave you to your graver steps hermione
 how thou lovest us show in our brother's welcome
 let what is dear in sicily be cheap
 next to thyself and my young rover he's
 apparent to my heart
hermione if you would seek us
 we are yours i the garden shall's attend you there
leontes to your own bents dispose you you'll be found
 be you beneath the sky
 aside
 i am angling now
 though you perceive me not how i give line
 go to go to
 how she holds up the neb the bill to him
 and arms her with the boldness of a wife
 to her allowing husband
 exeunt polixenes hermione and attendants
 gone already
 inchthick kneedeep o'er head and
 ears a fork'd one
 go play boy play thy mother plays and i
 play too but so disgraced a part whose issue
 will hiss me to my grave contempt and clamour
 will be my knell go play boy play
 there have been
 or i am much deceived cuckolds ere now
 and many a man there is even at this present
 now while i speak this holds his wife by the arm
 that little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
 and his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by
 sir smile his neighbour nay there's comfort in't
 whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd
 as mine against their will should all despair
 that have revolted wives the tenth of mankind
 would hang themselves physic for't there is none
 it is a bawdy planet that will strike
 where tis predominant and tis powerful think it
 from east west north and south be it concluded
 no barricado for a belly know't
 it will let in and out the enemy
 with bag and baggage many thousand on's
 have the disease and feel't not how now boy
mamillius i am like you they say
leontes why that's some comfort what camillo there
camillo ay my good lord
leontes go play mamillius thou'rt an honest man
 exit mamillius
 camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
camillo you had much ado to make his anchor hold
 when you cast out it still came home
leontes didst note it
camillo he would not stay at your petitions made
 his business more material
leontes didst perceive it
 aside
 they're here with me already whispering rounding
 sicilia is a soforth tis far gone
 when i shall gust it last how came't camillo
 that he did stay
camillo at the good queen's entreaty
leontes at the queen's be't good should be pertinent
 but so it is it is not was this taken
 by any understanding pate but thine
 for thy conceit is soaking will draw in
 more than the common blocks not noted is't
 but of the finer natures by some severals
 of headpiece extraordinary lower messes
 perchance are to this business purblind say
camillo business my lord i think most understand
 bohemia stays here longer
leontes ha
camillo stays here longer
leontes ay but why
camillo to satisfy your highness and the entreaties
 of our most gracious mistress
leontes satisfy
 the entreaties of your mistress satisfy
 let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo
 with all the nearest things to my heart as well
 my chambercouncils wherein priestlike thou
 hast cleansed my bosom i from thee departed
 thy penitent reform'd but we have been
 deceived in thy integrity deceived
 in that which seems so
camillo be it forbid my lord
leontes to bide upon't thou art not honest or
 if thou inclinest that way thou art a coward
 which hoxes honesty behind restraining
 from course required or else thou must be counted
 a servant grafted in my serious trust
 and therein negligent or else a fool
 that seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn
 and takest it all for jest
camillo my gracious lord
 i may be negligent foolish and fearful
 in every one of these no man is free
 but that his negligence his folly fear
 among the infinite doings of the world
 sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord
 if ever i were wilfulnegligent
 it was my folly if industriously
 i play'd the fool it was my negligence
 not weighing well the end if ever fearful
 to do a thing where i the issue doubted
 where of the execution did cry out
 against the nonperformance twas a fear
 which oft infects the wisest these my lord
 are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
 is never free of but beseech your grace
 be plainer with me let me know my trespass
 by its own visage if i then deny it
 tis none of mine
leontes ha not you seen camillo
 but that's past doubt you have or your eyeglass
 is thicker than a cuckold's hornor heard
 for to a vision so apparent rumour
 cannot be muteor thoughtfor cogitation
 resides not in that man that does not think
 my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess
 or else be impudently negative
 to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
 my wife's a hobbyhorse deserves a name
 as rank as any flaxwench that puts to
 before her trothplight say't and justify't
camillo i would not be a standerby to hear
 my sovereign mistress clouded so without
 my present vengeance taken shrew my heart
 you never spoke what did become you less
 than this which to reiterate were sin
 as deep as that though true
leontes is whispering nothing
 is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses
 kissing with inside lip stopping the career
 of laughing with a sigha note infallible
 of breaking honestyhorsing foot on foot
 skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
 hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes
 blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
 that would unseen be wicked is this nothing
 why then the world and all that's in't is nothing
 the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing
 my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
 if this be nothing
camillo good my lord be cured
 of this diseased opinion and betimes
 for tis most dangerous
leontes say it be tis true
camillo no no my lord
leontes it is you lie you lie
 i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee
 pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
 or else a hovering temporizer that
 canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
 inclining to them both were my wife's liver
 infected as her life she would not live
 the running of one glass
camillo who does infect her
leontes why he that wears her like a medal hanging
 about his neck bohemia who if i
 had servants true about me that bare eyes
 to see alike mine honour as their profits
 their own particular thrifts they would do that
 which should undo more doing ay and thou
 his cupbearerwhom i from meaner form
 have benched and reared to worship who mayst see
 plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
 how i am galledmightst bespice a cup
 to give mine enemy a lasting wink
 which draught to me were cordial
camillo sir my lord
 i could do this and that with no rash potion
 but with a lingering dram that should not work
 maliciously like poison but i cannot
 believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
 so sovereignly being honourable
 i have loved thee
leontes make that thy question and go rot
 dost think i am so muddy so unsettled
 to appoint myself in this vexation sully
 the purity and whiteness of my sheets
 which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
 is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
 give scandal to the blood o the prince my son
 who i do think is mine and love as mine
 without ripe moving to't would i do this
 could man so blench
camillo i must believe you sir
 i do and will fetch off bohemia for't
 provided that when he's removed your highness
 will take again your queen as yours at first
 even for your son's sake and thereby for sealing
 the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
 known and allied to yours
leontes thou dost advise me
 even so as i mine own course have set down
 i'll give no blemish to her honour none
camillo my lord
 go then and with a countenance as clear
 as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia
 and with your queen i am his cupbearer
 if from me he have wholesome beverage
 account me not your servant
leontes this is all
 do't and thou hast the one half of my heart
 do't not thou split'st thine own
camillo i'll do't my lord
leontes i will seem friendly as thou hast advised me
 exit
camillo o miserable lady but for me
 what case stand i in i must be the poisoner
 of good polixenes and my ground to do't
 is the obedience to a master one
 who in rebellion with himself will have
 all that are his so too to do this deed
 promotion follows if i could find example
 of thousands that had struck anointed kings
 and flourish'd after i'ld not do't but since
 nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
 let villany itself forswear't i must
 forsake the court to do't or no is certain
 to me a breakneck happy star reign now
 here comes bohemia
 reenter polixenes
polixenes this is strange methinks
 my favour here begins to warp not speak
 good day camillo
camillo hail most royal sir
polixenes what is the news i the court
camillo none rare my lord
polixenes the king hath on him such a countenance
 as he had lost some province and a region
 loved as he loves himself even now i met him
 with customary compliment when he
 wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
 a lip of much contempt speeds from me and
 so leaves me to consider what is breeding
 that changeth thus his manners
camillo i dare not know my lord
polixenes how dare not do not do you know and dare not
 be intelligent to me tis thereabouts
 for to yourself what you do know you must
 and cannot say you dare not good camillo
 your changed complexions are to me a mirror
 which shows me mine changed too for i must be
 a party in this alteration finding
 myself thus alter'd with t
camillo there is a sickness
 which puts some of us in distemper but
 i cannot name the disease and it is caught
 of you that yet are well
polixenes how caught of me
 make me not sighted like the basilisk
 i have look'd on thousands who have sped the better
 by my regard but kill'd none so camillo
 as you are certainly a gentleman thereto
 clerklike experienced which no less adorns
 our gentry than our parents noble names
 in whose success we are gentlei beseech you
 if you know aught which does behove my knowledge
 thereof to be inform'd imprison't not
 in ignorant concealment
camillo i may not answer
polixenes a sickness caught of me and yet i well
 i must be answer'd dost thou hear camillo
 i conjure thee by all the parts of man
 which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
 is not this suit of mine that thou declare
 what incidency thou dost guess of harm
 is creeping toward me how far off how near
 which way to be prevented if to be
 if not how best to bear it
camillo sir i will tell you
 since i am charged in honour and by him
 that i think honourable therefore mark my counsel
 which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
 i mean to utter it or both yourself and me
 cry lost and so good night
polixenes on good camillo
camillo i am appointed him to murder you
polixenes by whom camillo
camillo by the king
polixenes for what
camillo he thinks nay with all confidence he swears
 as he had seen't or been an instrument
 to vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen
 forbiddenly
polixenes o then my best blood turn
 to an infected jelly and my name
 be yoked with his that did betray the best
 turn then my freshest reputation to
 a savour that may strike the dullest nostril
 where i arrive and my approach be shunn'd
 nay hated too worse than the great'st infection
 that e'er was heard or read
camillo swear his thought over
 by each particular star in heaven and
 by all their influences you may as well
 forbid the sea for to obey the moon
 as or by oath remove or counsel shake
 the fabric of his folly whose foundation
 is piled upon his faith and will continue
 the standing of his body
polixenes how should this grow
camillo i know not but i am sure tis safer to
 avoid what's grown than question how tis born
 if therefore you dare trust my honesty
 that lies enclosed in this trunk which you
 shall bear along impawn'd away tonight
 your followers i will whisper to the business
 and will by twos and threes at several posterns
 clear them o the city for myself i'll put
 my fortunes to your service which are here
 by this discovery lost be not uncertain
 for by the honour of my parents i
 have utter'd truth which if you seek to prove
 i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
 than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth thereon
 his execution sworn
polixenes i do believe thee
 i saw his heart in s face give me thy hand
 be pilot to me and thy places shall
 still neighbour mine my ships are ready and
 my people did expect my hence departure
 two days ago this jealousy
 is for a precious creature as she's rare
 must it be great and as his person's mighty
 must it be violent and as he does conceive
 he is dishonour'd by a man which ever
 profess'd to him why his revenges must
 in that be made more bitter fear o'ershades me
 good expedition be my friend and comfort
 the gracious queen part of his theme but nothing
 of his illta'en suspicion come camillo
 i will respect thee as a father if
 thou bear'st my life off hence let us avoid
camillo it is in mine authority to command
 the keys of all the posterns please your highness
 to take the urgent hour come sir away

scene i a room in leontes palace
 enter hermione mamillius and ladies
hermione take the boy to you he so troubles me
 tis past enduring
first lady come my gracious lord
 shall i be your playfellow
mamillius no i'll none of you
first lady why my sweet lord
mamillius you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
 i were a baby still i love you better
second lady and why so my lord
mamillius not for because
 your brows are blacker yet black brows they say
 become some women best so that there be not
 too much hair there but in a semicircle
 or a halfmoon made with a pen
second lady who taught you this
mamillius i learnt it out of women's faces pray now
 what colour are your eyebrows
first lady blue my lord
mamillius nay that's a mock i have seen a lady's nose
 that has been blue but not her eyebrows
first lady hark ye
 the queen your mother rounds apace we shall
 present our services to a fine new prince
 one of these days and then you'ld wanton with us
 if we would have you
second lady she is spread of late
 into a goodly bulk good time encounter her
hermione what wisdom stirs amongst you come sir now
 i am for you again pray you sit by us
 and tell s a tale
mamillius merry or sad shall't be
hermione as merry as you will
mamillius a sad tale's best for winter i have one
 of sprites and goblins
hermione let's have that good sir
 come on sit down come on and do your best
 to fright me with your sprites you're powerful at it
mamillius there was a man
hermione nay come sit down then on
mamillius dwelt by a churchyard i will tell it softly
 yond crickets shall not hear it
hermione come on then
 and give't me in mine ear
 enter leontes with antigonus lords and others
leontes was he met there his train camillo with him
first lord behind the tuft of pines i met them never
 saw i men scour so on their way i eyed them
 even to their ships
leontes how blest am i
 in my just censure in my true opinion
 alack for lesser knowledge how accursed
 in being so blest there may be in the cup
 a spider steep'd and one may drink depart
 and yet partake no venom for his knowledge
 is not infected but if one present
 the abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known
 how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
 with violent hefts i have drunk
 and seen the spider
 camillo was his help in this his pander
 there is a plot against my life my crown
 all's true that is mistrusted that false villain
 whom i employ'd was preemploy'd by him
 he has discover'd my design and i
 remain a pinch'd thing yea a very trick
 for them to play at will how came the posterns
 so easily open
first lord by his great authority
 which often hath no less prevail'd than so
 on your command
leontes i know't too well
 give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him
 though he does bear some signs of me yet you
 have too much blood in him
hermione what is this sport
leontes bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
 away with him and let her sport herself
 with that she's big with for tis polixenes
 has made thee swell thus
hermione but i'ld say he had not
 and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying
 howe'er you lean to the nayward
leontes you my lords
 look on her mark her well be but about
 to say she is a goodly lady and
 the justice of your bearts will thereto add
 tis pity she's not honest honourable'
 praise her but for this her withoutdoor form
 which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
 the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
 that calumny doth useo i am out
 that mercy does for calumny will sear
 virtue itself these shrugs these hums and ha's
 when you have said she's goodly come between
 ere you can say she's honest but be t known
 from him that has most cause to grieve it should be
 she's an adulteress
hermione should a villain say so
 the most replenish'd villain in the world
 he were as much more villain you my lord
 do but mistake
leontes you have mistook my lady
 polixenes for leontes o thou thing
 which i'll not call a creature of thy place
 lest barbarism making me the precedent
 should a like language use to all degrees
 and mannerly distinguishment leave out
 betwixt the prince and beggar i have said
 she's an adulteress i have said with whom
 more she's a traitor and camillo is
 a federary with her and one that knows
 what she should shame to know herself
 but with her most vile principal that she's
 a bedswerver even as bad as those
 that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy
 to this their late escape
hermione no by my life
 privy to none of this how will this grieve you
 when you shall come to clearer knowledge that
 you thus have publish'd me gentle my lord
 you scarce can right me throughly then to say
 you did mistake
leontes no if i mistake
 in those foundations which i build upon
 the centre is not big enough to bear
 a schoolboy's top away with her to prison
 he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
 but that he speaks
hermione there's some ill planet reigns
 i must be patient till the heavens look
 with an aspect more favourable good my lords
 i am not prone to weeping as our sex
 commonly are the want of which vain dew
 perchance shall dry your pities but i have
 that honourable grief lodged here which burns
 worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords
 with thoughts so qualified as your charities
 shall best instruct you measure me and so
 the king's will be perform'd
leontes shall i be heard
hermione who is't that goes with me beseech your highness
 my women may be with me for you see
 my plight requires it do not weep good fools
 there is no cause when you shall know your mistress
 has deserved prison then abound in tears
 as i come out this action i now go on
 is for my better grace adieu my lord
 i never wish'd to see you sorry now
 i trust i shall my women come you have leave
leontes go do our bidding hence
 exit hermione guarded with ladies
first lord beseech your highness call the queen again
antigonus be certain what you do sir lest your justice
 prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
 yourself your queen your son
first lord for her my lord
 i dare my life lay down and will do't sir
 please you to accept it that the queen is spotless
 i the eyes of heaven and to you i mean
 in this which you accuse her
antigonus if it prove
 she's otherwise i'll keep my stables where
 i lodge my wife i'll go in couples with her
 than when i feel and see her no farther trust her
 for every inch of woman in the world
 ay every dram of woman's flesh is false if she be
leontes hold your peaces
first lord good my lord
antigonus it is for you we speak not for ourselves
 you are abused and by some putteron
 that will be damn'd for't would i knew the villain
 i would landdamn him be she honourflaw'd
 i have three daughters the eldest is eleven
 the second and the third nine and some five
 if this prove true they'll pay for't
 by mine honour
 i'll geld em all fourteen they shall not see
 to bring false generations they are coheirs
 and i had rather glib myself than they
 should not produce fair issue
leontes cease no more
 you smell this business with a sense as cold
 as is a dead man's nose but i do see't and feel't
 as you feel doing thus and see withal
 the instruments that feel
antigonus if it be so
 we need no grave to bury honesty
 there's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
 of the whole dungy earth
leontes what lack i credit
first lord i had rather you did lack than i my lord
 upon this ground and more it would content me
 to have her honour true than your suspicion
 be blamed for't how you might
leontes why what need we
 commune with you of this but rather follow
 our forceful instigation our prerogative
 calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
 imparts this which if you or stupefied
 or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
 relish a truth like us inform yourselves
 we need no more of your advice the matter
 the loss the gain the ordering on't is all
 properly ours
antigonus and i wish my liege
 you had only in your silent judgment tried it
 without more overture
leontes how could that be
 either thou art most ignorant by age
 or thou wert born a fool camillo's flight
 added to their familiarity
 which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture
 that lack'd sight only nought for approbation
 but only seeing all other circumstances
 made up to the deed doth push on this proceeding
 yet for a greater confirmation
 for in an act of this importance twere
 most piteous to be wild i have dispatch'd in post
 to sacred delphos to apollo's temple
 cleomenes and dion whom you know
 of stuff'd sufficiency now from the oracle
 they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
 shall stop or spur me have i done well
first lord well done my lord
leontes though i am satisfied and need no more
 than what i know yet shall the oracle
 give rest to the minds of others such as he
 whose ignorant credulity will not
 come up to the truth so have we thought it good
 from our free person she should be confined
 lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
 be left her to perform come follow us
 we are to speak in public for this business
 will raise us all
antigonus aside
 to laughter as i take it
 if the good truth were known

 which never tender lady hath born greater
 she is something before her time deliver'd
paulina a boy
emilia a daughter and a goodly babe
 lusty and like to live the queen receives
 much comfort in't says my poor prisoner
 i am innocent as you'
paulina i dare be sworn
 these dangerous unsafe lunes i the king
 beshrew them
 he must be told on't and he shall the office
 becomes a woman best i'll take't upon me
 if i prove honeymouth'd let my tongue blister
 and never to my redlook'd anger be
 the trumpet any more pray you emilia
 commend my best obedience to the queen
 if she dares trust me with her little babe
 i'll show't the king and undertake to be
 her advocate to the loud'st we do not know
 how he may soften at the sight o the child
 the silence often of pure innocence
 persuades when speaking fails
emilia most worthy madam
 your honour and your goodness is so evident
 that your free undertaking cannot miss
 a thriving issue there is no lady living
 so meet for this great errand please your ladyship
 to visit the next room i'll presently
 acquaint the queen of your most noble offer
 who but today hammer'd of this design
 but durst not tempt a minister of honour
 lest she should be denied
paulina tell her emilia
 i'll use that tongue i have if wit flow from't
 as boldness from my bosom let t not be doubted
 i shall do good
emilia now be you blest for it
 i'll to the queen please you
 come something nearer
gaoler madam if't please the queen to send the babe
 i know not what i shall incur to pass it
 having no warrant
paulina you need not fear it sir
 this child was prisoner to the womb and is
 by law and process of great nature thence
 freed and enfranchised not a party to
 the anger of the king nor guilty of
 if any be the trespass of the queen
gaoler i do believe it
paulina do not you fear upon mine honour
 i will stand betwixt you and danger

leontes nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness
 to bear the matter thus mere weakness if
 the cause were not in beingpart o the cause
 she the adulteress for the harlot king
 is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank
 and level of my brain plotproof but she
 i can hook to me say that she were gone
 given to the fire a moiety of my rest
 might come to me again who's there
first servant my lord
leontes how does the boy
first servant he took good rest tonight
 tis hoped his sickness is discharged
leontes to see his nobleness
 conceiving the dishonour of his mother
 he straight declined droop'd took it deeply
 fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself
 threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep
 and downright languish'd leave me solely go
 see how he fares
 exit servant
 fie fie no thought of him
 the thought of my revenges that way
 recoil upon me in himself too mighty
 and in his parties his alliance let him be
 until a time may serve for present vengeance
 take it on her camillo and polixenes
 laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow
 they should not laugh if i could reach them nor
 shall she within my power
 enter paulina with a child
first lord you must not enter
paulina nay rather good my lords be second to me
 fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
 than the queen's life a gracious innocent soul
 more free than he is jealous
antigonus that's enough
second servant madam he hath not slept tonight commanded
 none should come at him
paulina not so hot good sir
 i come to bring him sleep tis such as you
 that creep like shadows by him and do sigh
 at each his needless heavings such as you
 nourish the cause of his awaking i
 do come with words as medicinal as true
 honest as either to purge him of that humour
 that presses him from sleep
leontes what noise there ho
paulina no noise my lord but needful conference
 about some gossips for your highness
leontes how
 away with that audacious lady antigonus
 i charged thee that she should not come about me
 i knew she would
antigonus i told her so my lord
 on your displeasure's peril and on mine
 she should not visit you
leontes what canst not rule her
paulina from all dishonesty he can in this
 unless he take the course that you have done
 commit me for committing honour trust it
 he shall not rule me
antigonus la you now you hear
 when she will take the rein i let her run
 but she'll not stumble
paulina good my liege i come
 and i beseech you hear me who profess
 myself your loyal servant your physician
 your most obedient counsellor yet that dare
 less appear so in comforting your evils
 than such as most seem yours i say i come
 from your good queen
leontes good queen
paulina good queen my lord
 good queen i say good queen
 and would by combat make her good so were i
 a man the worst about you
leontes force her hence
paulina let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
 first hand me on mine own accord i'll off
 but first i'll do my errand the good queen
 for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter
 here tis commends it to your blessing
 laying down the child
leontes out
 a mankind witch hence with her out o door
 a most intelligencing bawd
paulina not so
 i am as ignorant in that as you
 in so entitling me and no less honest
 than you are mad which is enough i'll warrant
 as this world goes to pass for honest
leontes traitors
 will you not push her out give her the bastard
 thou dotard thou art womantired unroosted
 by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard
 take't up i say give't to thy crone
paulina for ever
 unvenerable be thy hands if thou
 takest up the princess by that forced baseness
 which he has put upon't
leontes he dreads his wife
paulina so i would you did then twere past all doubt
 you'ld call your children yours
leontes a nest of traitors
antigonus i am none by this good light
paulina nor i nor any
 but one that's here and that's himself for he
 the sacred honour of himself his queen's
 his hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander
 whose sting is sharper than the sword's
 and will not
 for as the case now stands it is a curse
 he cannot be compell'd to'tonce remove
 the root of his opinion which is rotten
 as ever oak or stone was sound
leontes a callat
 of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
 and now baits me this brat is none of mine
 it is the issue of polixenes
 hence with it and together with the dam
 commit them to the fire
paulina it is yours
 and might we lay the old proverb to your charge
 so like you tis the worse behold my lords
 although the print be little the whole matter
 and copy of the father eye nose lip
 the trick of's frown his forehead nay the valley
 the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek
 his smiles
 the very mould and frame of hand nail finger
 and thou good goddess nature which hast made it
 so like to him that got it if thou hast
 the ordering of the mind too mongst all colours
 no yellow in't lest she suspect as he does
 her children not her husband's
leontes a gross hag
 and lozel thou art worthy to be hang'd
 that wilt not stay her tongue
antigonus hang all the husbands
 that cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself
 hardly one subject
leontes once more take her hence
paulina a most unworthy and unnatural lord
 can do no more
leontes i'll ha thee burnt
paulina i care not
 it is an heretic that makes the fire
 not she which burns in't i'll not call you tyrant
 but this most cruel usage of your queen
 not able to produce more accusation
 than your own weakhinged fancy something savours
 of tyranny and will ignoble make you
 yea scandalous to the world
leontes on your allegiance
 out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant
 where were her life she durst not call me so
 if she did know me one away with her
paulina i pray you do not push me i'll be gone
 look to your babe my lord tis yours
 jove send her
 a better guiding spirit what needs these hands
 you that are thus so tender o'er his follies
 will never do him good not one of you
 so so farewell we are gone
 exit
leontes thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
 my child away with't even thou that hast
 a heart so tender o'er it take it hence
 and see it instantly consumed with fire
 even thou and none but thou take it up straight
 within this hour bring me word tis done
 and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life
 with what thou else call'st thine if thou refuse
 and wilt encounter with my wrath say so
 the bastard brains with these my proper hands
 shall i dash out go take it to the fire
 for thou set'st on thy wife
antigonus i did not sir
 these lords my noble fellows if they please
 can clear me in't
lords we can my royal liege
 he is not guilty of her coming hither
leontes you're liars all
first lord beseech your highness give us better credit
 we have always truly served you and beseech you
 so to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
 as recompense of our dear services
 past and to come that you do change this purpose
 which being so horrible so bloody must
 lead on to some foul issue we all kneel
leontes i am a feather for each wind that blows
 shall i live on to see this bastard kneel
 and call me father better burn it now
 than curse it then but be it let it live
 it shall not neither you sir come you hither
 you that have been so tenderly officious
 with lady margery your midwife there
 to save this bastard's lifefor tis a bastard
 so sure as this beard's grey
 what will you adventure
 to save this brat's life
antigonus any thing my lord
 that my ability may undergo
 and nobleness impose at least thus much
 i'll pawn the little blood which i have left
 to save the innocent any thing possible
leontes it shall be possible swear by this sword
 thou wilt perform my bidding
antigonus i will my lord
leontes mark and perform it see'st thou for the fail
 of any point in't shall not only be
 death to thyself but to thy lewdtongued wife
 whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee
 as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
 this female bastard hence and that thou bear it
 to some remote and desert place quite out
 of our dominions and that there thou leave it
 without more mercy to its own protection
 and favour of the climate as by strange fortune
 it came to us i do in justice charge thee
 on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture
 that thou commend it strangely to some place
 where chance may nurse or end it take it up
antigonus i swear to do this though a present death
 had been more merciful come on poor babe
 some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
 to be thy nurses wolves and bears they say
 casting their savageness aside have done
 like offices of pity sir be prosperous
 in more than this deed does require and blessing

leontes this sessions to our great grief we pronounce
 even pushes gainst our heart the party tried
 the daughter of a king our wife and one
 of us too much beloved let us be clear'd
 of being tyrannous since we so openly
 proceed in justice which shall have due course
 even to the guilt or the purgation

officer it is his highness pleasure that the queen
 appear in person here in court silence
 enter hermione guarded
 paulina and ladies attending
leontes read the indictment
officer reads hermione queen to the worthy
 leontes king of sicilia thou art here accused and
 arraigned of high treason in committing adultery
 with polixenes king of bohemia and conspiring
 with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
 lord the king thy royal husband the pretence
 whereof being by circumstances partly laid open
 thou hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance
 of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for
 their better safety to fly away by night
hermione since what i am to say must be but that
 which contradicts my accusation and
 the testimony on my part no other
 but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
 to say not guilty mine integrity
 being counted falsehood shall as i express it
 be so received but thus if powers divine
 behold our human actions as they do
 i doubt not then but innocence shall make
 false accusation blush and tyranny
 tremble at patience you my lord best know
 who least will seem to do so my past life
 hath been as continent as chaste as true
 as i am now unhappy which is more
 than history can pattern though devised
 and play'd to take spectators for behold me
 a fellow of the royal bed which owe
 a moiety of the throne a great king's daughter
 the mother to a hopeful prince here standing
 to prate and talk for life and honour fore
 who please to come and hear for life i prize it
 as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour
 tis a derivative from me to mine
 and only that i stand for i appeal
 to your own conscience sir before polixenes
 came to your court how i was in your grace
 how merited to be so since he came
 with what encounter so uncurrent i
 have strain'd to appear thus if one jot beyond
 the bound of honour or in act or will
 that way inclining harden'd be the hearts
 of all that hear me and my near'st of kin
 cry fie upon my grave
leontes i ne'er heard yet
 that any of these bolder vices wanted
 less impudence to gainsay what they did
 than to perform it first
hermione that's true enough
 through tis a saying sir not due to me
leontes you will not own it
hermione more than mistress of
 which comes to me in name of fault i must not
 at all acknowledge for polixenes
 with whom i am accused i do confess
 i loved him as in honour he required
 with such a kind of love as might become
 a lady like me with a love even such
 so and no other as yourself commanded
 which not to have done i think had been in me
 both disobedience and ingratitude
 to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
 even since it could speak from an infant freely
 that it was yours now for conspiracy
 i know not how it tastes though it be dish'd
 for me to try how all i know of it
 is that camillo was an honest man
 and why he left your court the gods themselves
 wotting no more than i are ignorant
leontes you knew of his departure as you know
 what you have underta'en to do in's absence
hermione sir
 you speak a language that i understand not
 my life stands in the level of your dreams
 which i'll lay down
leontes your actions are my dreams
 you had a bastard by polixenes
 and i but dream'd it as you were past all shame
 those of your fact are soso past all truth
 which to deny concerns more than avails for as
 thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
 no father owning itwhich is indeed
 more criminal in thee than itso thou
 shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
 look for no less than death
hermione sir spare your threats
 the bug which you would fright me with i seek
 to me can life be no commodity
 the crown and comfort of my life your favour
 i do give lost for i do feel it gone
 but know not how it went my second joy
 and firstfruits of my body from his presence
 i am barr'd like one infectious my third comfort
 starr'd most unluckily is from my breast
 the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth
 haled out to murder myself on every post
 proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred
 the childbed privilege denied which longs
 to women of all fashion lastly hurried
 here to this place i the open air before
 i have got strength of limit now my liege
 tell me what blessings i have here alive
 that i should fear to die therefore proceed
 but yet hear this mistake me not no life
 i prize it not a straw but for mine honour
 which i would free if i shall be condemn'd
 upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
 but what your jealousies awake i tell you
 tis rigor and not law your honours all
 i do refer me to the oracle
 apollo be my judge
first lord this your request
 is altogether just therefore bring forth
 and in apollos name his oracle
 exeunt certain officers
hermione the emperor of russia was my father
 o that he were alive and here beholding
 his daughter's trial that he did but see
 the flatness of my misery yet with eyes
 of pity not revenge
 reenter officers with cleomenes and dion
officer you here shall swear upon this sword of justice
 that you cleomenes and dion have
 been both at delphos and from thence have brought
 the seal'dup oracle by the hand deliver'd
 of great apollo's priest and that since then
 you have not dared to break the holy seal
 nor read the secrets in't
cleomenes 
 all this we swear

leontes break up the seals and read
officer reads hermione is chaste
 polixenes blameless camillo a true subject leontes

 and the king shall live without an heir if that
 which is lost be not found

 some remedies for life
 exeunt paulina and ladies with hermione
 apollo pardon
 my great profaneness gainst thine oracle
 i'll reconcile me to polixenes
 new woo my queen recall the good camillo
 whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy
 for being transported by my jealousies
 to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose
 camillo for the minister to poison
 my friend polixenes which had been done
 but that the good mind of camillo tardied
 my swift command though i with death and with
 reward did threaten and encourage him
 not doing t and being done he most humane
 and fill'd with honour to my kingly guest
 unclasp'd my practise quit his fortunes here
 which you knew great and to the hazard
 of all encertainties himself commended
 no richer than his honour how he glisters
 thorough my rust and how his pity
 does my deeds make the blacker
 reenter paulina
paulina woe the while
 o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
 break too
first lord what fit is this good lady
paulina what studied torments tyrant hast for me
 what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling
 in leads or oils what old or newer torture
 must i receive whose every word deserves
 to taste of thy most worst thy tyranny
 together working with thy jealousies
 fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
 for girls of nine o think what they have done
 and then run mad indeed stark mad for all
 thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it
 that thou betray'dst polixenes'twas nothing
 that did but show thee of a fool inconstant
 and damnable ingrateful nor was't much
 thou wouldst have poison'd good camillo's honour
 to have him kill a king poor trespasses
 more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon
 the casting forth to crows thy babydaughter
 to be or none or little though a devil
 would have shed water out of fire ere done't
 nor is't directly laid to thee the death
 of the young prince whose honourable thoughts
 thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
 that could conceive a gross and foolish sire
 blemish'd his gracious dam this is not no
 laid to thy answer but the lasto lords
 when i have said cry woe the queen the queen
 the sweet'st dear'st creature's dead
 and vengeance for't
 not dropp'd down yet
first lord the higher powers forbid
paulina i say she's dead i'll swear't if word nor oath
 prevail not go and see if you can bring
 tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
 heat outwardly or breath within i'll serve you
 as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant
 do not repent these things for they are heavier
 than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
 to nothing but despair a thousand knees
 ten thousand years together naked fasting
 upon a barren mountain and still winter
 in storm perpetual could not move the gods
 to look that way thou wert
leontes go on go on
 thou canst not speak too much i have deserved
 all tongues to talk their bitterest
first lord say no more
 howe'er the business goes you have made fault
 i the boldness of your speech
paulina i am sorry for't
 all faults i make when i shall come to know them
 i do repent alas i have show'd too much
 the rashness of a woman he is touch'd
 to the noble heart what's gone and what's past help
 should be past grief do not receive affliction
 at my petition i beseech you rather
 let me be punish'd that have minded you
 of what you should forget now good my liege
 sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman
 the love i bore your queenlo fool again
 i'll speak of her no more nor of your children
 i'll not remember you of my own lord
 who is lost too take your patience to you
 and i'll say nothing
leontes thou didst speak but well
 when most the truth which i receive much better
 than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me
 to the dead bodies of my queen and son
 one grave shall be for both upon them shall
 the causes of their death appear unto
 our shame perpetual once a day i'll visit
 the chapel where they lie and tears shed there
 shall be my recreation so long as nature
 will bear up with this exercise so long
 i daily vow to use it come and lead me
 unto these sorrows

 his name was antigonus a nobleman but to make an
 end of the ship to see how the sea flapdragoned

polixenes i pray thee good camillo be no more importunate
 tis a sickness denying thee any thing a death to
 grant this
camillo it is fifteen years since i saw my country though
 i have for the most part been aired abroad i
 desire to lay my bones there besides the penitent
 king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling
 sorrows i might be some allay or i o'erween to
 think so which is another spur to my departure
polixenes as thou lovest me camillo wipe not out the rest of
 thy services by leaving me now the need i have of
 thee thine own goodness hath made better not to
 have had thee than thus to want thee thou having
 made me businesses which none without thee can
 sufficiently manage must either stay to execute
 them thyself or take away with thee the very
 services thou hast done which if i have not enough
 considered as too much i cannot to be more
 thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit
 therein the heaping friendships of that fatal
 country sicilia prithee speak no more whose very
 naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
 penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king
 my brother whose loss of his most precious queen
 and children are even now to be afresh lamented
 say to me when sawest thou the prince florizel my
 son kings are no less unhappy their issue not
 being gracious than they are in losing them when
 they have approved their virtues
camillo sir it is three days since i saw the prince what
 his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but i
 have missingly noted he is of late much retired
 from court and is less frequent to his princely
 exercises than formerly he hath appeared
polixenes i have considered so much camillo and with some
 care so far that i have eyes under my service which
 look upon his removedness from whom i have this
 intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a
 most homely shepherd a man they say that from
 very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
 neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
camillo i have heard sir of such a man who hath a
 daughter of most rare note the report of her is
 extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage
polixenes that's likewise part of my intelligence but i
 fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou
 shalt accompany us to the place where we will not
 appearing what we are have some question with the
 shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not
 uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither
 prithee be my present partner in this business and
 lay aside the thoughts of sicilia
camillo i willingly obey your command
polixenes my best camillo we must disguise ourselves

florizel these your unusual weeds to each part of you
 do give a life no shepherdess but flora
 peering in april's front this your sheepshearing
 is as a meeting of the petty gods
 and you the queen on't
perdita sir my gracious lord
 to chide at your extremes it not becomes me
 o pardon that i name them your high self
 the gracious mark o the land you have obscured
 with a swain's wearing and me poor lowly maid
 most goddesslike prank'd up but that our feasts
 in every mess have folly and the feeders
 digest it with a custom i should blush
 to see you so attired sworn i think
 to show myself a glass
florizel i bless the time
 when my good falcon made her flight across
 thy father's ground
perdita now jove afford you cause
 to me the difference forges dread your greatness
 hath not been used to fear even now i tremble
 to think your father by some accident
 should pass this way as you did o the fates
 how would he look to see his work so noble
 vilely bound up what would he say or how
 should i in these my borrow'd flaunts behold
 the sternness of his presence
florizel apprehend
 nothing but jollity the gods themselves
 humbling their deities to love have taken
 the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter
 became a bull and bellow'd the green neptune
 a ram and bleated and the firerobed god
 golden apollo a poor humble swain
 as i seem now their transformations
 were never for a piece of beauty rarer
 nor in a way so chaste since my desires
 run not before mine honour nor my lusts
 burn hotter than my faith
perdita o but sir
 your resolution cannot hold when tis
 opposed as it must be by the power of the king
 one of these two must be necessities
 which then will speak that you must
 change this purpose
 or i my life
florizel thou dearest perdita
 with these forced thoughts i prithee darken not
 the mirth o the feast or i'll be thine my fair
 or not my father's for i cannot be
 mine own nor any thing to any if
 i be not thine to this i am most constant

 flowers o the season

 which some call nature's bastards of that kind
 our rustic garden's barren and i care not
 to get slips of them
polixenes wherefore gentle maiden
 do you neglect them
perdita for i have heard it said
 there is an art which in their piedness shares
 with great creating nature
polixenes say there be
 yet nature is made better by no mean
 but nature makes that mean so over that art
 which you say adds to nature is an art
 that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry
 a gentler scion to the wildest stock
 and make conceive a bark of baser kind
 by bud of nobler race this is an art
 which does mend nature change it rather but
 the art itself is nature
perdita so it is
polixenes then make your garden rich in gillyvors
 and do not call them bastards

 your maidenheads growing o proserpina
 for the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall
 from dis's waggon daffodils
 that come before the swallow dares and take
 the winds of march with beauty violets dim

 bight phoebus in his strengtha malady
 most incident to maids bold oxlips and
 the crown imperial lilies of all kinds
 the flowerdeluce being one o these i lack

 i'ld have you do it ever when you sing
 i'ld have you buy and sell so so give alms
 pray so and for the ordering your affairs
 to sing them too when you do dance i wish you
 a wave o the sea that you might ever do
 nothing but that move still still so
 and own no other function each your doing
 so singular in each particular
 crowns what you are doing in the present deed
 that all your acts are queens
perdita o doricles
 your praises are too large but that your youth
 and the true blood which peepeth fairly through't
 do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd
 with wisdom i might fear my doricles

 as little skill to fear as i have purpose
 to put you to't but come our dance i pray

 upon his own report and i believe it
 he looks like sooth he says he loves my daughter
 i think so too for never gazed the moon
 upon the water as he'll stand and read
 as twere my daughter's eyes and to be plain
 i think there is not half a kiss to choose
 who loves another best
polixenes she dances featly
shepherd so she does any thing though i report it
 that should be silent if young doricles
 do light upon her she shall bring him that
 which he not dreams of

 ears grew to his tunes
clown he could never come better he shall come in i
 love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful
 matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing

servant he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no
 milliner can so fit his customers with gloves he
 has the prettiest lovesongs for maids so without
 bawdry which is strange with such delicate
 burthens of dildos and fadings jump her and thump
 her and where some stretchmouthed rascal would
 as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into
 the matter he makes the maid to answer whoop do me
 no harm good man puts him off slights him with
 whoop do me no harm good man'
polixenes this is a brave fellow
clown believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited
 fellow has he any unbraided wares
servant he hath ribbons of an the colours i the rainbow

 learnedly handle though they come to him by the
 gross inkles caddisses cambrics lawns why he
 sings em over as they were gods or goddesses you

clown have i not told thee how i was cozened by the way

servant master there is three carters three shepherds
 three neatherds three swineherds that have made
 themselves all men of hair they call themselves
 saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches
 say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are
 not in't but they themselves are o the mind if it
 be not too rough for some that know little but
 bowling it will please plentifully
shepherd away we'll none on t here has been too much
 homely foolery already i know sir we weary you
polixenes you weary those that refresh us pray let's see
 these four threes of herdsmen
servant one three of them by their own report sir hath
 danced before the king and not the worst of the
 three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier
shepherd leave your prating since these good men are
 pleased let them come in but quickly now
servant why they stay at door sir
 exit
 here a dance of twelve satyrs
polixenes o father you'll know more of that hereafter
 to camillo
 is it not too far gone tis time to part them
 he's simple and tells much
 to florizel
 how now fair shepherd
 your heart is full of something that does take
 your mind from feasting sooth when i was young
 and handed love as you do i was wont
 to load my she with knacks i would have ransack'd
 the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
 to her acceptance you have let him go
 and nothing marted with him if your lass
 interpretation should abuse and call this
 your lack of love or bounty you were straited
 for a reply at least if you make a care
 of happy holding her
florizel old sir i know
 she prizes not such trifles as these are
 the gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
 up in my heart which i have given already
 but not deliver'd o hear me breathe my life
 before this ancient sir who it should seem
 hath sometime loved i take thy hand this hand
 as soft as dove's down and as white as it
 or ethiopian's tooth or the fann'd
 snow that's bolted
 by the northern blasts twice o'er
polixenes what follows this
 how prettily the young swain seems to wash
 the hand was fair before i have put you out
 but to your protestation let me hear
 what you profess
florizel do and be witness to t
polixenes and this my neighbour too
florizel and he and more
 than he and men the earth the heavens and all
 that were i crown'd the most imperial monarch
 thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth
 that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
 more than was ever man's i would not prize them
 without her love for her employ them all
 commend them and condemn them to her service
 or to their own perdition
polixenes fairly offer'd
camillo this shows a sound affection
shepherd but my daughter
 say you the like to him
perdita i cannot speak
 so well nothing so well no nor mean better
 by the pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out
 the purity of his
shepherd take hands a bargain
 and friends unknown you shall bear witness to t
 i give my daughter to him and will make
 her portion equal his
florizel o that must be
 i the virtue of your daughter one being dead
 i shall have more than you can dream of yet
 enough then for your wonder but come on
 contract us fore these witnesses
shepherd come your hand
 and daughter yours
polixenes soft swain awhile beseech you
 have you a father
florizel i have but what of him
polixenes knows he of this
florizel he neither does nor shall
polixenes methinks a father
 is at the nuptial of his son a guest
 that best becomes the table pray you once more
 is not your father grown incapable
 of reasonable affairs is he not stupid
 with age and altering rheums can he speak hear
 know man from man dispute his own estate
 lies he not bedrid and again does nothing
 but what he did being childish
florizel no good sir
 he has his health and ampler strength indeed
 than most have of his age
polixenes by my white beard
 you offer him if this be so a wrong
 something unfilial reason my son
 should choose himself a wife but as good reason
 the father all whose joy is nothing else
 but fair posterity should hold some counsel
 in such a business
florizel i yield all this
 but for some other reasons my grave sir
 which tis not fit you know i not acquaint
 my father of this business
polixenes let him know't
florizel he shall not
polixenes prithee let him
florizel no he must not
shepherd let him my son he shall not need to grieve
 at knowing of thy choice
florizel come come he must not
 mark our contract
polixenes mark your divorce young sir
 discovering himself
 whom son i dare not call thou art too base
 to be acknowledged thou a sceptre's heir
 that thus affect'st a sheephook thou old traitor
 i am sorry that by hanging thee i can
 but shorten thy life one week and thou fresh piece
 of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
 the royal fool thou copest with
shepherd o my heart
polixenes i'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made
 more homely than thy state for thee fond boy
 if i may ever know thou dost but sigh
 that thou no more shalt see this knack as never
 i mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession
 not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
 far than deucalion off mark thou my words
 follow us to the court thou churl for this time
 though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
 from the dead blow of it and you enchantment
 worthy enough a herdsman yea him too
 that makes himself but for our honour therein
 unworthy theeif ever henceforth thou
 these rural latches to his entrance open
 or hoop his body more with thy embraces
 i will devise a death as cruel for thee
 as thou art tender to't
 exit
perdita even here undone
 i was not much afeard for once or twice
 i was about to speak and tell him plainly
 the selfsame sun that shines upon his court
 hides not his visage from our cottage but
 looks on alike will't please you sir be gone
 i told you what would come of this beseech you
 of your own state take care this dream of mine
 being now awake i'll queen it no inch farther
 but milk my ewes and weep
camillo why how now father
 speak ere thou diest
shepherd i cannot speak nor think
 nor dare to know that which i know o sir
 you have undone a man of fourscore three
 that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
 to die upon the bed my father died
 to lie close by his honest bones but now
 some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
 where no priest shovels in dust o cursed wretch
 that knew'st this was the prince
 and wouldst adventure
 to mingle faith with him undone undone
 if i might die within this hour i have lived
 to die when i desire
 exit
florizel why look you so upon me
 i am but sorry not afeard delay'd
 but nothing alter'd what i was i am
 more straining on for plucking back not following
 my leash unwillingly
camillo gracious my lord
 you know your father's temper at this time
 he will allow no speech which i do guess
 you do not purpose to him and as hardly
 will he endure your sight as yet i fear
 then till the fury of his highness settle
 come not before him
florizel i not purpose it
 i think camillo
camillo even he my lord
perdita how often have i told you twould be thus
 how often said my dignity would last
 but till twere known
florizel it cannot fail but by
 the violation of my faith and then
 let nature crush the sides o the earth together
 and mar the seeds within lift up thy looks
 from my succession wipe me father i
 am heir to my affection
camillo be advised
florizel i am and by my fancy if my reason
 will thereto be obedient i have reason
 if not my senses better pleased with madness
 do bid it welcome
camillo this is desperate sir
florizel so call it but it does fulfil my vow
 i needs must think it honesty camillo
 not for bohemia nor the pomp that may
 be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or
 the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
 in unknown fathoms will i break my oath
 to this my fair beloved therefore i pray you
 as you have ever been my father's honour'd friend
 when he shall miss meas in faith i mean not
 to see him any morecast your good counsels
 upon his passion let myself and fortune
 tug for the time to come this you may know
 and so deliver i am put to sea
 with her whom here i cannot hold on shore
 and most opportune to our need i have
 a vessel rides fast by but not prepared
 for this design what course i mean to hold
 shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
 concern me the reporting
camillo o my lord
 i would your spirit were easier for advice
 or stronger for your need
florizel hark perdita
 drawing her aside
 i'll hear you by and by
camillo he's irremoveable
 resolved for flight now were i happy if
 his going i could frame to serve my turn
 save him from danger do him love and honour
 purchase the sight again of dear sicilia
 and that unhappy king my master whom
 i so much thirst to see
florizel now good camillo
 i am so fraught with curious business that
 i leave out ceremony
camillo sir i think
 you have heard of my poor services i the love
 that i have borne your father
florizel very nobly
 have you deserved it is my father's music
 to speak your deeds not little of his care
 to have them recompensed as thought on
camillo well my lord
 if you may please to think i love the king
 and through him what is nearest to him which is
 your gracious self embrace but my direction
 if your more ponderous and settled project
 may suffer alteration on mine honour
 i'll point you where you shall have such receiving
 as shall become your highness where you may
 enjoy your mistress from the whom i see
 there's no disjunction to be made but by
 as heavens forefendyour ruin marry her
 and with my best endeavours in your absence
 your discontenting father strive to qualify
 and bring him up to liking
florizel how camillo
 may this almost a miracle be done
 that i may call thee something more than man
 and after that trust to thee
camillo have you thought on
 a place whereto you'll go
florizel not any yet
 but as the unthoughton accident is guilty
 to what we wildly do so we profess
 ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
 of every wind that blows
camillo then list to me
 this follows if you will not change your purpose
 but undergo this flight make for sicilia
 and there present yourself and your fair princess
 for so i see she must be fore leontes
 she shall be habited as it becomes
 the partner of your bed methinks i see
 leontes opening his free arms and weeping
 his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness
 as twere i the father's person kisses the hands
 of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him
 twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one
 he chides to hell and bids the other grow
 faster than thought or time
florizel worthy camillo
 what colour for my visitation shall i
 hold up before him
camillo sent by the king your father
 to greet him and to give him comforts sir
 the manner of your bearing towards him with
 what you as from your father shall deliver
 things known betwixt us three i'll write you down
 the which shall point you forth at every sitting
 what you must say that he shall not perceive
 but that you have your father's bosom there
 and speak his very heart
florizel i am bound to you
 there is some sap in this
camillo a cause more promising
 than a wild dedication of yourselves
 to unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain
 to miseries enough no hope to help you
 but as you shake off one to take another
 nothing so certain as your anchors who
 do their best office if they can but stay you
 where you'll be loath to be besides you know
 prosperity's the very bond of love
 whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
 affliction alters
perdita one of these is true
 i think affliction may subdue the cheek
 but not take in the mind
camillo yea say you so
 there shall not at your father's house these
 seven years
 be born another such
florizel my good camillo
 she is as forward of her breeding as
 she is i the rear our birth
camillo i cannot say tis pity
 she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
 to most that teach
perdita your pardon sir for this
 i'll blush you thanks
florizel my prettiest perdita
 but o the thorns we stand upon camillo
 preserver of my father now of me
 the medicine of our house how shall we do
 we are not furnish'd like bohemia's son
 nor shall appear in sicilia
camillo my lord
 fear none of this i think you know my fortunes
 do all lie there it shall be so my care
 to have you royally appointed as if
 the scene you play were mine for instance sir
 that you may know you shall not want one word
 they talk aside
 reenter autolycus
autolycus ha ha what a fool honesty is and trust his
 sworn brother a very simple gentleman i have sold
 all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a
 ribbon glass pomander brooch tablebook ballad
 knife tape glove shoetie bracelet hornring
 to keep my pack from fasting they throng who
 should buy first as if my trinkets had been
 hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer
 by which means i saw whose purse was best in
 picture and what i saw to my good use i
 remembered my clown who wants but something to
 be a reasonable man grew so in love with the
 wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes
 till he had both tune and words which so drew the
 rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
 stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it
 was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
 purse i could have filed keys off that hung in
 chains no hearing no feeling but my sir's song
 and admiring the nothing of it so that in this
 time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their
 festival purses and had not the old man come in
 with a whoobub against his daughter and the king's
 son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not
 left a purse alive in the whole army
 camillo florizel and perdita come forward
camillo nay but my letters by this means being there
 so soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt

florizel fortune speed us
 thus we set on camillo to the seaside
camillo the swifter speed the better
 exeunt florizel perdita and camillo
autolycus i understand the business i hear it to have an
 open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is
 necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite
 also to smell out work for the other senses i see
 this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive
 what an exchange had this been without boot what
 a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do
 this year connive at us and we may do any thing
 extempore the prince himself is about a piece of
 iniquity stealing away from his father with his
 clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of
 honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not
 do't i hold it the more knavery to conceal it
 and therein am i constant to my profession
 reenter clown and shepherd
 aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain
 every lane's end every shop church session
 hanging yields a careful man work
clown see see what a man you are now
 there is no other way but to tell the king
 she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood
shepherd nay but hear me
clown nay but hear me
shepherd go to then
clown she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh
 and blood has not offended the king and so your
 flesh and blood is not to be punished by him show
 those things you found about her those secret
 things all but what she has with her this being
 done let the law go whistle i warrant you
shepherd i will tell the king all every word yea and his
 son's pranks too who i may say is no honest man
 neither to his father nor to me to go about to make
 me the king's brotherinlaw
clown indeed brotherinlaw was the farthest off you
 could have been to him and then your blood had been
 the dearer by i know how much an ounce
autolycus aside very wisely puppies
shepherd well let us to the king there is that in this
 fardel will make him scratch his beard
autolycus aside i know not what impediment this complaint
 may be to the flight of my master
clown pray heartily he be at palace
autolycus aside though i am not naturally honest i am so
 sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement
 takes off his false beard
 how now rustics whither are you bound
shepherd to the palace an it like your worship
autolycus your affairs there what with whom the condition
 of that fardel the place of your dwelling your
 names your ages of what having breeding and any
 thing that is fitting to be known discover
clown we are but plain fellows sir
autolycus a lie you are rough and hairy let me have no
 lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they
 often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for
 it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore
 they do not give us the lie
clown your worship had like to have given us one if you
 had not taken yourself with the manner
shepherd are you a courtier an't like you sir
autolycus whether it like me or no i am a courtier seest
 thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings
 hath not my gait in it the measure of the court
 receives not thy nose courtodor from me reflect i
 not on thy baseness courtcontempt thinkest thou
 for that i insinuate or toaze from thee thy
 business i am therefore no courtier i am courtier
 capape and one that will either push on or pluck
 back thy business there whereupon i command thee to
 open thy affair
shepherd my business sir is to the king
autolycus what advocate hast thou to him
shepherd i know not an't like you
clown advocate's the courtword for a pheasant say you
 have none
shepherd none sir i have no pheasant cock nor hen
autolycus how blessed are we that are not simple men
 yet nature might have made me as these are
 therefore i will not disdain
clown this cannot be but a great courtier
shepherd his garments are rich but he wears
 them not handsomely
clown he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical
 a great man i'll warrant i know by the picking
 on's teeth
autolycus the fardel there what's i the fardel
 wherefore that box
shepherd sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box
 which none must know but the king and which he
 shall know within this hour if i may come to the
 speech of him
autolycus age thou hast lost thy labour
shepherd why sir
autolycus the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a
 new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for
 if thou beest capable of things serious thou must
 know the king is full of grief
shepard so tis said sir about his son that should have
 married a shepherd's daughter
autolycus if that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly
 the curses he shall have the tortures he shall
 feel will break the back of man the heart of monster
clown think you so sir
autolycus not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
 and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to
 him though removed fifty times shall all come
 under the hangman which though it be great pity
 yet it is necessary an old sheepwhistling rogue a
 ramtender to offer to have his daughter come into
 grace some say he shall be stoned but that death
 is too soft for him say i draw our throne into a
 sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy
clown has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear an't
 like you sir
autolycus he has a son who shall be flayed alive then
 nointed over with honey set on the head of a
 wasp's nest then stand till he be three quarters
 and a dram dead then recovered again with
 aquavitae or some other hot infusion then raw as
 he is and in the hottest day prognostication
 proclaims shall be be set against a brickwall the
 sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he
 is to behold him with flies blown to death but what
 talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries
 are to be smiled at their offences being so
 capital tell me for you seem to be honest plain
 men what you have to the king being something
 gently considered i'll bring you where he is
 aboard tender your persons to his presence
 whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man
 besides the king to effect your suits here is man
 shall do it
clown he seems to be of great authority close with him
 give him gold and though authority be a stubborn
 bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold show
 the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand
 and no more ado remember stoned and flayed alive'
shepherd an't please you sir to undertake the business for
 us here is that gold i have i'll make it as much
 more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you
autolycus after i have done what i promised
shepherd ay sir
autolycus well give me the moiety are you a party in this business
clown in some sort sir but though my case be a pitiful
 one i hope i shall not be flayed out of it
autolycus o that's the case of the shepherd's son hang him
 he'll be made an example
clown comfort good comfort we must to the king and show
 our strange sights he must know tis none of your
 daughter nor my sister we are gone else sir i
 will give you as much as this old man does when the
 business is performed and remain as he says your
 pawn till it be brought you
autolycus i will trust you walk before toward the seaside
 go on the right hand i will but look upon the
 hedge and follow you
clown we are blest in this man as i may say even blest
shepherd let's before as he bids us he was provided to do us good
 exeunt shepherd and clown
autolycus if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would
 not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth i am
 courted now with a double occasion gold and a means
 to do the prince my master good which who knows how
 that may turn back to my advancement i will bring
 these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he
 think it fit to shore them again and that the
 complaint they have to the king concerns him
 nothing let him call me rogue for being so far
 officious for i am proof against that title and
 what shame else belongs to't to him will i present
 them there may be matter in it
 exit
 the winter's tale
act v
scene i a room in leontes palace
 enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and servants
cleomenes sir you have done enough and have perform'd
 a saintlike sorrow no fault could you make
 which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down
 more penitence than done trespass at the last
 do as the heavens have done forget your evil
 with them forgive yourself
leontes whilst i remember
 her and her virtues i cannot forget
 my blemishes in them and so still think of
 the wrong i did myself which was so much
 that heirless it hath made my kingdom and
 destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
 bred his hopes out of
paulina true too true my lord
 if one by one you wedded all the world
 or from the all that are took something good
 to make a perfect woman she you kill'd
 would be unparallel'd
leontes i think so kill'd
 she i kill'd i did so but thou strikest me
 sorely to say i did it is as bitter
 upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now
 say so but seldom
cleomenes not at all good lady
 you might have spoken a thousand things that would
 have done the time more benefit and graced
 your kindness better
paulina you are one of those
 would have him wed again
dion if you would not so
 you pity not the state nor the remembrance
 of his most sovereign name consider little
 what dangers by his highness fail of issue
 may drop upon his kingdom and devour
 incertain lookers on what were more holy
 than to rejoice the former queen is well
 what holier than for royalty's repair
 for present comfort and for future good
 to bless the bed of majesty again
 with a sweet fellow to't
paulina there is none worthy
 respecting her that's gone besides the gods
 will have fulfill'd their secret purposes
 for has not the divine apollo said
 is't not the tenor of his oracle
 that king leontes shall not have an heir
 till his lost child be found which that it shall
 is all as monstrous to our human reason
 as my antigonus to break his grave
 and come again to me who on my life
 did perish with the infant tis your counsel
 my lord should to the heavens be contrary
 oppose against their wills
 to leontes
 care not for issue
 the crown will find an heir great alexander
 left his to the worthiest so his successor
 was like to be the best
leontes good paulina
 who hast the memory of hermione
 i know in honour o that ever i
 had squared me to thy counsel then even now
 i might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes
 have taken treasure from her lips
paulina and left them
 more rich for what they yielded
leontes thou speak'st truth
 no more such wives therefore no wife one worse
 and better used would make her sainted spirit
 again possess her corpse and on this stage
 where we're offenders now appear soulvex'd
 and begin why to me'
paulina had she such power
 she had just cause
leontes she had and would incense me
 to murder her i married
paulina i should so
 were i the ghost that walk'd i'ld bid you mark
 her eye and tell me for what dull part in't
 you chose her then i'ld shriek that even your ears
 should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd
 should be remember mine'
leontes stars stars
 and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife
 i'll have no wife paulina
paulina will you swear
 never to marry but by my free leave
leontes never paulina so be blest my spirit
paulina then good my lords bear witness to his oath
cleomenes you tempt him overmuch
paulina unless another
 as like hermione as is her picture
 affront his eye
cleomenes good madam
paulina i have done
 yet if my lord will marryif you will sir
 no remedy but you willgive me the office
 to choose you a queen she shall not be so young
 as was your former but she shall be such
 as walk'd your first queen's ghost
 it should take joy
 to see her in your arms
leontes my true paulina
 we shall not marry till thou bid'st us
paulina that
 shall be when your first queen's again in breath
 never till then
 enter a gentleman
gentleman one that gives out himself prince florizel
 son of polixenes with his princess she
 the fairest i have yet beheld desires access
 to your high presence
leontes what with him he comes not
 like to his father's greatness his approach
 so out of circumstance and sudden tells us
 tis not a visitation framed but forced
 by need and accident what train
gentleman but few
 and those but mean
leontes his princess say you with him
gentleman ay the most peerless piece of earth i think
 that e'er the sun shone bright on
paulina o hermione
 as every present time doth boast itself
 above a better gone so must thy grave
 give way to what's seen now sir you yourself
 have said and writ so but your writing now
 is colder than that theme she had not been
 nor was not to be equall'd'thus your verse
 flow'd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebb'd
 to say you have seen a better
gentleman pardon madam
 the one i have almost forgotyour pardon
 the other when she has obtain'd your eye
 will have your tongue too this is a creature
 would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
 of all professors else make proselytes
 of who she but bid follow
paulina how not women
gentleman women will love her that she is a woman
 more worth than any man men that she is
 the rarest of all women
leontes go cleomenes
 yourself assisted with your honour'd friends
 bring them to our embracement still tis strange
 exeunt cleomenes and others
 he thus should steal upon us
paulina had our prince
 jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd
 well with this lord there was not full a month
 between their births
leontes prithee no more cease thou know'st
 he dies to me again when talk'd of sure
 when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches
 will bring me to consider that which may
 unfurnish me of reason they are come
 reenter cleomenes and others with florizel and perdita
 your mother was most true to wedlock prince
 for she did print your royal father off
 conceiving you were i but twentyone
 your father's image is so hit in you
 his very air that i should call you brother
 as i did him and speak of something wildly
 by us perform'd before most dearly welcome
 and your fair princessgoddesso alas
 i lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth
 might thus have stood begetting wonder as
 you gracious couple do and then i lost
 all mine own follythe society
 amity too of your brave father whom
 though bearing misery i desire my life
 once more to look on him
florizel by his command
 have i here touch'd sicilia and from him
 give you all greetings that a king at friend
 can send his brother and but infirmity
 which waits upon worn times hath something seized
 his wish'd ability he had himself
 the lands and waters twixt your throne and his
 measured to look upon you whom he loves
 he bade me say somore than all the sceptres
 and those that bear them living
leontes o my brother
 good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir
 afresh within me and these thy offices
 so rarely kind are as interpreters
 of my behindhand slackness welcome hither
 as is the spring to the earth and hath he too
 exposed this paragon to the fearful usage
 at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune
 to greet a man not worth her pains much less
 the adventure of her person
florizel good my lord
 she came from libya
leontes where the warlike smalus
 that noble honour'd lord is fear'd and loved
florizel most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
 his tears proclaim'd his parting with her thence
 a prosperous southwind friendly we have cross'd
 to execute the charge my father gave me
 for visiting your highness my best train
 i have from your sicilian shores dismiss'd
 who for bohemia bend to signify
 not only my success in libya sir
 but my arrival and my wife's in safety
 here where we are
leontes the blessed gods
 purge all infection from our air whilst you
 do climate here you have a holy father
 a graceful gentleman against whose person
 so sacred as it is i have done sin
 for which the heavens taking angry note
 have left me issueless and your father's blest
 as he from heaven merits it with you
 worthy his goodness what might i have been
 might i a son and daughter now have look'd on
 such goodly things as you
 enter a lord
lord most noble sir
 that which i shall report will bear no credit
 were not the proof so nigh please you great sir
 bohemia greets you from himself by me
 desires you to attach his son who has
 his dignity and duty both cast off
 fled from his father from his hopes and with
 a shepherd's daughter
leontes where's bohemia speak
lord here in your city i now came from him
 i speak amazedly and it becomes
 my marvel and my message to your court
 whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems
 of this fair couple meets he on the way
 the father of this seeming lady and
 her brother having both their country quitted
 with this young prince
florizel camillo has betray'd me
 whose honour and whose honesty till now
 endured all weathers
lord lay't so to his charge
 he's with the king your father
leontes who camillo
lord camillo sir i spake with him who now
 has these poor men in question never saw i
 wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth
 forswear themselves as often as they speak
 bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
 with divers deaths in death
perdita o my poor father
 the heaven sets spies upon us will not have
 our contract celebrated
leontes you are married
florizel we are not sir nor are we like to be
 the stars i see will kiss the valleys first
 the odds for high and low's alike
leontes my lord
 is this the daughter of a king
florizel she is
 when once she is my wife
leontes that once i see by your good father's speed
 will come on very slowly i am sorry
 most sorry you have broken from his liking
 where you were tied in duty and as sorry
 your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
 that you might well enjoy her
florizel dear look up
 though fortune visible an enemy
 should chase us with my father power no jot
 hath she to change our loves beseech you sir
 remember since you owed no more to time
 than i do now with thought of such affections
 step forth mine advocate at your request
 my father will grant precious things as trifles
leontes would he do so i'ld beg your precious mistress
 which he counts but a trifle
paulina sir my liege
 your eye hath too much youth in't not a month
 fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
 than what you look on now
leontes i thought of her
 even in these looks i made
 to florizel
 but your petition
 is yet unanswer'd i will to your father
 your honour not o'erthrown by your desires
 i am friend to them and you upon which errand
 i now go toward him therefore follow me
 and mark what way i make come good my lord
 exeunt
 the winter's tale
act v
scene ii before leontes palace
 enter autolycus and a gentleman
autolycus beseech you sir were you present at this relation
first gentleman i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old
 shepherd deliver the manner how he found it
 whereupon after a little amazedness we were all
 commanded out of the chamber only this methought i
 heard the shepherd say he found the child
autolycus i would most gladly know the issue of it
first gentleman i make a broken delivery of the business but the
 changes i perceived in the king and camillo were
 very notes of admiration they seemed almost with
 staring on one another to tear the cases of their
 eyes there was speech in their dumbness language
 in their very gesture they looked as they had heard
 of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable
 passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest
 beholder that knew no more but seeing could not
 say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the
 extremity of the one it must needs be
 enter another gentleman
 here comes a gentleman that haply knows more
 the news rogero
second gentleman nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the
 king's daughter is found such a deal of wonder is
 broken out within this hour that balladmakers
 cannot be able to express it
 enter a third gentleman
 here comes the lady paulina's steward he can
 deliver you more how goes it now sir this news
 which is called true is so like an old tale that
 the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king
 found his heir
third gentleman most true if ever truth were pregnant by
 circumstance that which you hear you'll swear you
 see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle
 of queen hermione's her jewel about the neck of it
 the letters of antigonus found with it which they
 know to be his character the majesty of the
 creature in resemblance of the mother the affection
 of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding
 and many other evidences proclaim her with all
 certainty to be the king's daughter did you see
 the meeting of the two kings
second gentleman no
third gentleman then have you lost a sight which was to be seen
 cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one
 joy crown another so and in such manner that it
 seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their
 joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes
 holding up of hands with countenances of such
 distraction that they were to be known by garment
 not by favour our king being ready to leap out of
 himself for joy of his found daughter as if that
 joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother
 thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then
 embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his
 daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old
 shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten
 conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such
 another encounter which lames report to follow it
 and undoes description to do it
second gentleman what pray you became of antigonus that carried
 hence the child
third gentleman like an old tale still which will have matter to
 rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear
 open he was torn to pieces with a bear this
 avouches the shepherd's son who has not only his
 innocence which seems much to justify him but a
 handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows
first gentleman what became of his bark and his followers
third gentleman wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
 in the view of the shepherd so that all the
 instruments which aided to expose the child were
 even then lost when it was found but o the noble
 combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
 paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of
 her husband another elevated that the oracle was
 fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth
 and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin
 her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
 of losing
first gentleman the dignity of this act was worth the audience of
 kings and princes for by such was it acted
third gentleman one of the prettiest touches of all and that which
 angled for mine eyes caught the water though not
 the fish was when at the relation of the queen's
 death with the manner how she came to't bravely
 confessed and lamented by the king how
 attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one
 sign of dolour to another she did with an alas'
 i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my
 heart wept blood who was most marble there changed
 colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world
 could have seen t the woe had been universal
first gentleman are they returned to the court
third gentleman no the princess hearing of her mother's statue
 which is in the keeping of paulinaa piece many
 years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
 italian master julio romano who had he himself
 eternity and could put breath into his work would
 beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her
 ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that
 they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
 answer thither with all greediness of affection
 are they gone and there they intend to sup
second gentleman i thought she had some great matter there in hand
 for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever
 since the death of hermione visited that removed
 house shall we thither and with our company piece
 the rejoicing
first gentleman who would be thence that has the benefit of access
 every wink of an eye some new grace will be born
 our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge
 let's along
 exeunt gentlemen
autolycus now had i not the dash of my former life in me
 would preferment drop on my head i brought the old
 man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard
 them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he
 at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter
 so he then took her to be who began to be much
 seasick and himself little better extremity of
 weather continuing this mystery remained
 undiscovered but tis all one to me for had i
 been the finder out of this secret it would not
 have relished among my other discredits
 enter shepherd and clown
 here come those i have done good to against my will
 and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune
shepherd come boy i am past moe children but thy sons and
 daughters will be all gentlemen born
clown you are well met sir you denied to fight with me
 this other day because i was no gentleman born
 see you these clothes say you see them not and
 think me still no gentleman born you were best say
 these robes are not gentlemen born give me the
 lie do and try whether i am not now a gentleman born
autolycus i know you are now sir a gentleman born
clown ay and have been so any time these four hours
shepherd and so have i boy
clown so you have but i was a gentleman born before my
 father for the king's son took me by the hand and
 called me brother and then the two kings called my
 father brother and then the prince my brother and
 the princess my sister called my father father and
 so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike
 tears that ever we shed
shepherd we may live son to shed many more
clown ay or else twere hard luck being in so
 preposterous estate as we are
autolycus i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the
 faults i have committed to your worship and to give
 me your good report to the prince my master
shepherd prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are
 gentlemen
clown thou wilt amend thy life
autolycus ay an it like your good worship
clown give me thy hand i will swear to the prince thou
 art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia
shepherd you may say it but not swear it
clown not swear it now i am a gentleman let boors and
 franklins say it i'll swear it
shepherd how if it be false son
clown if it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear
 it in the behalf of his friend and i'll swear to
 the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
 that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no
 tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
 drunk but i'll swear it and i would thou wouldst
 be a tall fellow of thy hands
autolycus i will prove so sir to my power
clown ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not
 wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not
 being a tall fellow trust me not hark the kings
 and the princes our kindred are going to see the
 queen's picture come follow us we'll be thy
 good masters

 the winter's tale
act v
scene iii a chapel in paulina's house
 enter leontes polixenes florizel perdita
 camillo paulina lords and attendants
leontes o grave and good paulina the great comfort
 that i have had of thee
paulina what sovereign sir
 i did not well i meant well all my services
 you have paid home but that you have vouchsafed
 with your crown'd brother and these your contracted
 heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
 it is a surplus of your grace which never
 my life may last to answer
leontes o paulina
 we honour you with trouble but we came
 to see the statue of our queen your gallery
 have we pass'd through not without much content
 in many singularities but we saw not
 that which my daughter came to look upon
 the statue of her mother
paulina as she lived peerless
 so her dead likeness i do well believe
 excels whatever yet you look'd upon
 or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it
 lonely apart but here it is prepare
 to see the life as lively mock'd as ever
 still sleep mock'd death behold and say tis well
 paulina draws a curtain and discovers hermione
 standing like a statue
 i like your silence it the more shows off
 your wonder but yet speak first you my liege
 comes it not something near
leontes her natural posture
 chide me dear stone that i may say indeed
 thou art hermione or rather thou art she
 in thy not chiding for she was as tender
 as infancy and grace but yet paulina
 hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
 so aged as this seems
polixenes o not by much
paulina so much the more our carver's excellence
 which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
 as she lived now
leontes as now she might have done
 so much to my good comfort as it is
 now piercing to my soul o thus she stood
 even with such life of majesty warm life
 as now it coldly stands when first i woo'd her
 i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me
 for being more stone than it o royal piece
 there's magic in thy majesty which has
 my evils conjured to remembrance and
 from thy admiring daughter took the spirits
 standing like stone with thee
perdita and give me leave
 and do not say tis superstition that
 i kneel and then implore her blessing lady
 dear queen that ended when i but began
 give me that hand of yours to kiss
paulina o patience
 the statue is but newly fix'd the colour's not dry
camillo my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
 which sixteen winters cannot blow away
 so many summers dry scarce any joy
 did ever so long live no sorrow
 but kill'd itself much sooner
polixenes dear my brother
 let him that was the cause of this have power
 to take off so much grief from you as he
 will piece up in himself
paulina indeed my lord
 if i had thought the sight of my poor image
 would thus have wrought youfor the stone is mine
 i'ld not have show'd it
leontes do not draw the curtain
paulina no longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy
 may think anon it moves
leontes let be let be
 would i were dead but that methinks already
 what was he that did make it see my lord
 would you not deem it breathed and that those veins
 did verily bear blood
polixenes masterly done
 the very life seems warm upon her lip
leontes the fixture of her eye has motion in't
 as we are mock'd with art
paulina i'll draw the curtain
 my lord's almost so far transported that
 he'll think anon it lives
leontes o sweet paulina
 make me to think so twenty years together
 no settled senses of the world can match
 the pleasure of that madness let t alone
paulina i am sorry sir i have thus far stirr'd you but
 i could afflict you farther
leontes do paulina
 for this affliction has a taste as sweet
 as any cordial comfort still methinks
 there is an air comes from her what fine chisel
 could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me
 for i will kiss her
paulina good my lord forbear
 the ruddiness upon her lip is wet
 you'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
 with oily painting shall i draw the curtain
leontes no not these twenty years
perdita so long could i
 stand by a looker on
paulina either forbear
 quit presently the chapel or resolve you
 for more amazement if you can behold it
 i'll make the statue move indeed descend
 and take you by the hand but then you'll think
 which i protest againsti am assisted
 by wicked powers
leontes what you can make her do
 i am content to look on what to speak
 i am content to hear for tis as easy
 to make her speak as move
paulina it is required
 you do awake your faith then all stand still
 on those that think it is unlawful business
 i am about let them depart
leontes proceed
 no foot shall stir
paulina music awake her strike
 music
 tis time descend be stone no more approach
 strike all that look upon with marvel come
 i'll fill your grave up stir nay come away
 bequeath to death your numbness for from him
 dear life redeems you you perceive she stirs
 hermione comes down
 start not her actions shall be holy as
 you hear my spell is lawful do not shun her
 until you see her die again for then
 you kill her double nay present your hand
 when she was young you woo'd her now in age
 is she become the suitor
leontes o she's warm
 if this be magic let it be an art
 lawful as eating
polixenes she embraces him
camillo she hangs about his neck
 if she pertain to life let her speak too
polixenes ay and make't manifest where she has lived
 or how stolen from the dead
paulina that she is living
 were it but told you should be hooted at
 like an old tale but it appears she lives
 though yet she speak not mark a little while
 please you to interpose fair madam kneel
 and pray your mother's blessing turn good lady
 our perdita is found
hermione you gods look down
 and from your sacred vials pour your graces
 upon my daughter's head tell me mine own
 where hast thou been preserved where lived how found
 thy father's court for thou shalt hear that i
 knowing by paulina that the oracle
 gave hope thou wast in being have preserved
 myself to see the issue
paulina there's time enough for that
 lest they desire upon this push to trouble
 your joys with like relation go together
 you precious winners all your exultation
 partake to every one i an old turtle
 will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
 my mate that's never to be found again
 lament till i am lost
leontes o peace paulina
 thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
 as i by thine a wife this is a match
 and made between's by vows thou hast found mine
 but how is to be question'd for i saw her
 as i thought dead and have in vain said many
 a prayer upon her grave i'll not seek far
 for him i partly know his mindto find thee
 an honourable husband come camillo
 and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
 is richly noted and here justified
 by us a pair of kings let's from this place
 what look upon my brother both your pardons
 that e'er i put between your holy looks
 my ill suspicion this is your soninlaw
 and son unto the king who heavens directing
 is trothplight to your daughter good paulina
 lead us from hence where we may leisurely
 each one demand an answer to his part
 perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
 we were dissever'd hastily lead away

act i
scene i london the palace
 enter king henry lord john of lancaster the earl
 of westmoreland sir walter blunt and others
king henry iv so shaken as we are so wan with care
 find we a time for frighted peace to pant
 and breathe shortwinded accents of new broils
 to be commenced in strands afar remote
 no more the thirsty entrance of this soil
 shall daub her lips with her own children's blood
 nor more shall trenching war channel her fields
 nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
 of hostile paces those opposed eyes
 which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
 all of one nature of one substance bred
 did lately meet in the intestine shock
 and furious close of civil butchery
 shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks
 march all one way and be no more opposed
 against acquaintance kindred and allies
 the edge of war like an illsheathed knife
 no more shall cut his master therefore friends
 as far as to the sepulchre of christ
 whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
 we are impressed and engaged to fight
 forthwith a power of english shall we levy
 whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb
 to chase these pagans in those holy fields
 over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
 which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
 for our advantage on the bitter cross
 but this our purpose now is twelve month old
 and bootless tis to tell you we will go
 therefore we meet not now then let me hear
 of you my gentle cousin westmoreland
 what yesternight our council did decree
 in forwarding this dear expedience
westmoreland my liege this haste was hot in question
 and many limits of the charge set down
 but yesternight when all athwart there came
 a post from wales loaden with heavy news
 whose worst was that the noble mortimer
 leading the men of herefordshire to fight
 against the irregular and wild glendower
 was by the rude hands of that welshman taken
 a thousand of his people butchered
 upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
 such beastly shameless transformation
 by those welshwomen done as may not be
 without much shame retold or spoken of
king henry iv it seems then that the tidings of this broil
 brake off our business for the holy land
westmoreland this match'd with other did my gracious lord
 for more uneven and unwelcome news
 came from the north and thus it did import
 on holyrood day the gallant hotspur there
 young harry percy and brave archibald
 that evervaliant and approved scot
 at holmedon met
 where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
 as by discharge of their artillery
 and shape of likelihood the news was told
 for he that brought them in the very heat
 and pride of their contention did take horse
 uncertain of the issue any way
king henry iv here is a dear a true industrious friend
 sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse
 stain'd with the variation of each soil
 betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours
 and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
 the earl of douglas is discomfited
 ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights
 balk'd in their own blood did sir walter see
 on holmedon's plains of prisoners hotspur took
 mordake the earl of fife and eldest son
 to beaten douglas and the earl of athol
 of murray angus and menteith
 and is not this an honourable spoil
 a gallant prize ha cousin is it not
westmoreland in faith
 it is a conquest for a prince to boast of
king henry iv yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
 in envy that my lord northumberland
 should be the father to so blest a son
 a son who is the theme of honour's tongue
 amongst a grove the very straightest plant
 who is sweet fortune's minion and her pride
 whilst i by looking on the praise of him
 see riot and dishonour stain the brow
 of my young harry o that it could be proved
 that some nighttripping fairy had exchanged
 in cradleclothes our children where they lay
 and call'd mine percy his plantagenet
 then would i have his harry and he mine
 but let him from my thoughts what think you coz
 of this young percy's pride the prisoners
 which he in this adventure hath surprised
 to his own use he keeps and sends me word
 i shall have none but mordake earl of fife
westmoreland this is his uncle's teaching this is worcester
 malevolent to you in all aspects
 which makes him prune himself and bristle up
 the crest of youth against your dignity
king henry iv but i have sent for him to answer this
 and for this cause awhile we must neglect
 our holy purpose to jerusalem
 cousin on wednesday next our council we
 will hold at windsor so inform the lords
 but come yourself with speed to us again
 for more is to be said and to be done
 than out of anger can be uttered
westmoreland i will my liege

act i
scene ii london an apartment of the prince's
 enter the prince of wales and falstaff
falstaff now hal what time of day is it lad
prince henry thou art so fatwitted with drinking of old sack
 and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
 benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to
 demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know
 what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
 day unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
 capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
 signs of leapinghouses and the blessed sun himself
 a fair hot wench in flamecoloured taffeta i see no
 reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
 the time of the day
falstaff indeed you come near me now hal for we that take
 purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not
 by phoebus he'that wandering knight so fair and
 i prithee sweet wag when thou art king as god
 save thy gracemajesty i should say for grace
 thou wilt have none
prince henry what none
falstaff no by my troth not so much as will serve to
 prologue to an egg and butter
prince henry well how then come roundly roundly
falstaff marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not
 us that are squires of the night's body be called
 thieves of the day's beauty let us be diana's
 foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the
 moon and let men say we be men of good government
 being governed as the sea is by our noble and
 chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal
prince henry thou sayest well and it holds well too for the
 fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
 flow like the sea being governed as the sea is
 by the moon as for proof now a purse of gold
 most resolutely snatched on monday night and most
 dissolutely spent on tuesday morning got with
 swearing lay by and spent with crying bring in'
 now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
 and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows
falstaff by the lord thou sayest true lad and is not my
 hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench
prince henry as the honey of hybla my old lad of the castle and
 is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
falstaff how now how now mad wag what in thy quips and
 thy quiddities what a plague have i to do with a
 buff jerkin
prince henry why what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern
falstaff well thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
 time and oft
prince henry did i ever call for thee to pay thy part
falstaff no i'll give thee thy due thou hast paid all there

falstaff yea and so used it that were it not here apparent

prince henry thou judgest false already i mean thou shalt have
 the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman
falstaff well hal well and in some sort it jumps with my
 humour as well as waiting in the court i can tell
 you
prince henry for obtaining of suits
falstaff yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman
 hath no lean wardrobe sblood i am as melancholy
 as a gib cat or a lugged bear
prince henry or an old lion or a lover's lute
falstaff yea or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe
prince henry what sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of
 moorditch
falstaff thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
 the most comparative rascalliest sweet young
 prince but hal i prithee trouble me no more
 with vanity i would to god thou and i knew where a
 commodity of good names were to be bought an old
 lord of the council rated me the other day in the
 street about you sir but i marked him not and yet
 he talked very wisely but i regarded him not and
 yet he talked wisely and in the street too
prince henry thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the
 streets and no man regards it
falstaff o thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
 to corrupt a saint thou hast done much harm upon
 me hal god forgive thee for it before i knew
 thee hal i knew nothing and now am i if a man
 should speak truly little better than one of the
 wicked i must give over this life and i will give
 it over by the lord and i do not i am a villain
 i'll be damned for never a king's son in
 christendom
prince henry where shall we take a purse tomorrow jack
falstaff zounds where thou wilt lad i'll make one an i
 do not call me villain and baffle me
prince henry i see a good amendment of life in thee from praying
 to pursetaking
falstaff why hal tis my vocation hal tis no sin for a
 man to labour in his vocation
 enter poins
 poins now shall we know if gadshill have set a
 match o if men were to be saved by merit what
 hole in hell were hot enough for him this is the
 most omnipotent villain that ever cried stand to
 a true man
prince henry good morrow ned
poins good morrow sweet hal what says monsieur remorse
 what says sir john sack and sugar jack how
 agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou
 soldest him on goodfriday last for a cup of madeira
 and a cold capon's leg
prince henry sir john stands to his word the devil shall have
 his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of
 proverbs he will give the devil his due
poins then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil
prince henry else he had been damned for cozening the devil
poins but my lads my lads tomorrow morning by four
 o'clock early at gadshill there are pilgrims going
 to canterbury with rich offerings and traders
 riding to london with fat purses i have vizards
 for you all you have horses for yourselves
 gadshill lies tonight in rochester i have bespoke
 supper tomorrow night in eastcheap we may do it
 as secure as sleep if you will go i will stuff
 your purses full of crowns if you will not tarry
 at home and be hanged
falstaff hear ye yedward if i tarry at home and go not
 i'll hang you for going
poins you will chops
falstaff hal wilt thou make one
prince henry who i rob i a thief not i by my faith
falstaff there's neither honesty manhood nor good
 fellowship in thee nor thou camest not of the blood
 royal if thou darest not stand for ten shillings
prince henry well then once in my days i'll be a madcap
falstaff why that's well said
prince henry well come what will i'll tarry at home
falstaff by the lord i'll be a traitor then when thou art king
prince henry i care not
poins sir john i prithee leave the prince and me alone
 i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
 that he shall go
falstaff well god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
 the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may
 move and what he hears may be believed that the
 true prince may for recreation sake prove a false
 thief for the poor abuses of the time want
 countenance farewell you shall find me in eastcheap
prince henry farewell thou latter spring farewell allhallown summer
 exit falstaff
poins now my good sweet honey lord ride with us
 tomorrow i have a jest to execute that i cannot
 manage alone falstaff bardolph peto and gadshill
 shall rob those men that we have already waylaid
 yourself and i will not be there and when they
 have the booty if you and i do not rob them cut
 this head off from my shoulders
prince henry how shall we part with them in setting forth
poins why we will set forth before or after them and
 appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at
 our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure
 upon the exploit themselves which they shall have
 no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them
prince henry yea but tis like that they will know us by our
 horses by our habits and by every other
 appointment to be ourselves
poins tut our horses they shall not see i'll tie them
 in the wood our vizards we will change after we
 leave them and sirrah i have cases of buckram
 for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments
prince henry yea but i doubt they will be too hard for us
poins well for two of them i know them to be as
 truebred cowards as ever turned back and for the
 third if he fight longer than he sees reason i'll
 forswear arms the virtue of this jest will be the
 incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
 tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at
 least he fought with what wards what blows what
 extremities he endured and in the reproof of this
 lies the jest
prince henry well i'll go with thee provide us all things
 necessary and meet me tomorrow night in eastcheap
 there i'll sup farewell
poins farewell my lord
 exit poins
prince henry i know you all and will awhile uphold
 the unyoked humour of your idleness
 yet herein will i imitate the sun
 who doth permit the base contagious clouds
 to smother up his beauty from the world
 that when he please again to be himself
 being wanted he may be more wonder'd at
 by breaking through the foul and ugly mists
 of vapours that did seem to strangle him
 if all the year were playing holidays
 to sport would be as tedious as to work
 but when they seldom come they wish'd for come
 and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
 so when this loose behavior i throw off
 and pay the debt i never promised
 by how much better than my word i am
 by so much shall i falsify men's hopes
 and like bright metal on a sullen ground
 my reformation glittering o'er my fault
 shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
 than that which hath no foil to set it off
 i'll so offend to make offence a skill
 redeeming time when men think least i will

act i
scene iii london the palace
 enter the king northumberland worcester hotspur
 sir walter blunt with others
king henry iv my blood hath been too cold and temperate
 unapt to stir at these indignities
 and you have found me for accordingly
 you tread upon my patience but be sure
 i will from henceforth rather be myself
 mighty and to be fear'd than my condition
 which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
 and therefore lost that title of respect
 which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud
earl of worcester our house my sovereign liege little deserves
 the scourge of greatness to be used on it
 and that same greatness too which our own hands
 have holp to make so portly
northumberland my lord
king henry iv worcester get thee gone for i do see
 danger and disobedience in thine eye
 o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
 and majesty might never yet endure
 the moody frontier of a servant brow
 you have good leave to leave us when we need
 your use and counsel we shall send for you
 exit worcester
 you were about to speak
 to north
northumberland yea my good lord
 those prisoners in your highness name demanded
 which harry percy here at holmedon took
 were as he says not with such strength denied
 as is deliver'd to your majesty
 either envy therefore or misprison
 is guilty of this fault and not my son
hotspur my liege i did deny no prisoners
 but i remember when the fight was done
 when i was dry with rage and extreme toil
 breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
 came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd
 fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap'd
 show'd like a stubbleland at harvesthome
 he was perfumed like a milliner
 and twixt his finger and his thumb he held
 a pouncetbox which ever and anon
 he gave his nose and took't away again
 who therewith angry when it next came there
 took it in snuff and still he smiled and talk'd
 and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
 he call'd them untaught knaves unmannerly
 to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
 betwixt the wind and his nobility
 with many holiday and lady terms
 he question'd me amongst the rest demanded
 my prisoners in your majesty's behalf
 i then all smarting with my wounds being cold
 to be so pester'd with a popinjay
 out of my grief and my impatience
 answer'd neglectingly i know not what
 he should or he should not for he made me mad
 to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
 and talk so like a waitinggentlewoman
 of guns and drums and woundsgod save the mark
 and telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
 was parmaceti for an inward bruise
 and that it was great pity so it was
 this villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
 out of the bowels of the harmless earth
 which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
 so cowardly and but for these vile guns
 he would himself have been a soldier
 this bald unjointed chat of his my lord
 i answer'd indirectly as i said
 and i beseech you let not his report
 come current for an accusation
 betwixt my love and your high majesty
sir walter blunt the circumstance consider'd good my lord
 whate'er lord harry percy then had said
 to such a person and in such a place
 at such a time with all the rest retold
 may reasonably die and never rise
 to do him wrong or any way impeach
 what then he said so he unsay it now
king henry iv why yet he doth deny his prisoners
 but with proviso and exception
 that we at our own charge shall ransom straight
 his brotherinlaw the foolish mortimer
 who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd
 the lives of those that he did lead to fight
 against that great magician damn'd glendower
 whose daughter as we hear the earl of march
 hath lately married shall our coffers then
 be emptied to redeem a traitor home
 shall we but treason and indent with fears
 when they have lost and forfeited themselves
 no on the barren mountains let him starve
 for i shall never hold that man my friend
 whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
 to ransom home revolted mortimer
hotspur revolted mortimer
 he never did fall off my sovereign liege
 but by the chance of war to prove that true
 needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
 those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
 when on the gentle severn's sedgy bank
 in single opposition hand to hand
 he did confound the best part of an hour
 in changing hardiment with great glendower
 three times they breathed and three times did
 they drink
 upon agreement of swift severn's flood
 who then affrighted with their bloody looks
 ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
 and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
 bloodstained with these valiant combatants
 never did base and rotten policy
 colour her working with such deadly wounds
 nor could the noble mortimer
 receive so many and all willingly
 then let not him be slander'd with revolt
king henry iv thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him
 he never did encounter with glendower
 i tell thee
 he durst as well have met the devil alone
 as owen glendower for an enemy
 art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth
 let me not hear you speak of mortimer
 send me your prisoners with the speediest means
 or you shall hear in such a kind from me
 as will displease you my lord northumberland
 we licence your departure with your son
 send us your prisoners or you will hear of it
 exeunt king henry blunt and train
hotspur an if the devil come and roar for them
 i will not send them i will after straight
 and tell him so for i will ease my heart
 albeit i make a hazard of my head
northumberland what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile
 here comes your uncle
 reenter worcester
hotspur speak of mortimer
 zounds i will speak of him and let my soul
 want mercy if i do not join with him
 yea on his part i'll empty all these veins
 and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
 but i will lift the downtrod mortimer
 as high in the air as this unthankful king
 as this ingrate and canker'd bolingbroke
northumberland brother the king hath made your nephew mad
earl of worcester who struck this heat up after i was gone
hotspur he will forsooth have all my prisoners
 and when i urged the ransom once again
 of my wife's brother then his cheek look'd pale
 and on my face he turn'd an eye of death
 trembling even at the name of mortimer
earl of worcester i cannot blame him was not he proclaim'd
 by richard that dead is the next of blood
northumberland he was i heard the proclamation
 and then it was when the unhappy king
 whose wrongs in us god pardondid set forth
 upon his irish expedition
 from whence he intercepted did return
 to be deposed and shortly murdered
earl of worcester and for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
 live scandalized and foully spoken of
hotspur but soft i pray you did king richard then
 proclaim my brother edmund mortimer
 heir to the crown
northumberland he did myself did hear it
hotspur nay then i cannot blame his cousin king
 that wished him on the barren mountains starve
 but shall it be that you that set the crown
 upon the head of this forgetful man
 and for his sake wear the detested blot
 of murderous subornation shall it be
 that you a world of curses undergo
 being the agents or base second means
 the cords the ladder or the hangman rather
 o pardon me that i descend so low
 to show the line and the predicament
 wherein you range under this subtle king
 shall it for shame be spoken in these days
 or fill up chronicles in time to come
 that men of your nobility and power
 did gage them both in an unjust behalf
 as both of yougod pardon ithave done
 to put down richard that sweet lovely rose
 an plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke
 and shall it in more shame be further spoken
 that you are fool'd discarded and shook off
 by him for whom these shames ye underwent
 no yet time serves wherein you may redeem
 your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
 into the good thoughts of the world again
 revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
 of this proud king who studies day and night
 to answer all the debt he owes to you
 even with the bloody payment of your deaths
 therefore i say
earl of worcester peace cousin say no more
 and now i will unclasp a secret book
 and to your quickconceiving discontents
 i'll read you matter deep and dangerous
 as full of peril and adventurous spirit
 as to o'erwalk a current roaring loud
 on the unsteadfast footing of a spear
hotspur if he fall in good night or sink or swim
 send danger from the east unto the west
 so honour cross it from the north to south
 and let them grapple o the blood more stirs
 to rouse a lion than to start a hare
northumberland imagination of some great exploit
 drives him beyond the bounds of patience
hotspur by heaven methinks it were an easy leap
 to pluck bright honour from the palefaced moon
 or dive into the bottom of the deep
 where fathomline could never touch the ground
 and pluck up drowned honour by the locks
 so he that doth redeem her thence might wear
 without corrival all her dignities
 but out upon this halffaced fellowship
earl of worcester he apprehends a world of figures here
 but not the form of what he should attend
 good cousin give me audience for a while
hotspur i cry you mercy
earl of worcester those same noble scots
 that are your prisoners
hotspur i'll keep them all
 by god he shall not have a scot of them
 no if a scot would save his soul he shall not
 i'll keep them by this hand
earl of worcester you start away
 and lend no ear unto my purposes
 those prisoners you shall keep
hotspur nay i will that's flat
 he said he would not ransom mortimer
 forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer
 but i will find him when he lies asleep
 and in his ear i'll holla mortimer'
 nay
 i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
 nothing but mortimer and give it him
 to keep his anger still in motion
earl of worcester hear you cousin a word
hotspur all studies here i solemnly defy
 save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke
 and that same swordandbuckler prince of wales
 but that i think his father loves him not
 and would be glad he met with some mischance
 i would have him poison'd with a pot of ale
earl of worcester farewell kinsman i'll talk to you
 when you are better temper'd to attend
northumberland why what a waspstung and impatient fool
 art thou to break into this woman's mood
 tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
hotspur why look you i am whipp'd and scourged with rods
 nettled and stung with pismires when i hear
 of this vile politician bolingbroke
 in richard's timewhat do you call the place
 a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire
 twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
 his uncle york where i first bow'd my knee
 unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke
 sblood
 when you and he came back from ravenspurgh
northumberland at berkley castle
hotspur you say true
 why what a candy deal of courtesy
 this fawning greyhound then did proffer me

 deliver them up without their ransom straight
 and make the douglas son your only mean
 for powers in scotland which for divers reasons
 which i shall send you written be assured

 your son in scotland being thus employ'd
 shall secretly into the bosom creep
 of that same noble prelate well beloved
 the archbishop
hotspur of york is it not
earl of worcester true who bears hard
 his brother's death at bristol the lord scroop

earl of worcester and tis no little reason bids us speed
 to save our heads by raising of a head
 for bear ourselves as even as we can

 and see already how he doth begin
 to make us strangers to his looks of love
hotspur he does he does we'll be revenged on him
earl of worcester cousin farewell no further go in this
 than i by letters shall direct your course
 when time is ripe which will be suddenly
 i'll steal to glendower and lord mortimer
 where you and douglas and our powers at once
 as i will fashion it shall happily meet
 to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
 which now we hold at much uncertainty
northumberland farewell good brother we shall thrive i trust
hotspur uncle adieu o let the hours be short

chamberlain good morrow master gadshill it holds current that
 i told you yesternight there's a franklin in the
 wild of kent hath brought three hundred marks with
 him in gold i heard him tell it to one of his
 company last night at supper a kind of auditor one

 of prisoners ransom and of soldiers slain
 and all the currents of a heady fight
 thy spirit within thee hath been so at war

 time but also how thou art accompanied for though
 the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster

 sooner it wears that thou art my son i have
 partly thy mother's word partly my own opinion
 but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
 foolishhanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant
 me if then thou be son to me here lies the point
 why being son to me art thou so pointed at shall
 the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
 blackberries a question not to be asked shall
 the sun of england prove a thief and take purses a
 question to be asked there is a thing harry
 which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
 many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch
 as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth
 the company thou keepest for harry now i do not
 speak to thee in drink but in tears not in
 pleasure but in passion not in words only but in
 woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom i
 have often noted in thy company but i know not his name
prince henry what manner of man an it like your majesty
falstaff a goodly portly man i faith and a corpulent of a
 cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble
 carriage and as i think his age some fifty or
 by'r lady inclining to three score and now i
 remember me his name is falstaff if that man
 should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for harry

 known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then

 old fat man a tun of man is thy companion why
 dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that
 boltinghutch of beastliness that swollen parcel
 of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed
 cloakbag of guts that roasted manningtree ox with
 the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that
 grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in
 years wherein is he good but to taste sack and
 drink it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a
 capon and eat it wherein cunning but in craft
 wherein crafty but in villany wherein villanous

act iii
scene i bangor the archdeacon's house
 enter hotspur worcester mortimer and glendower
mortimer these promises are fair the parties sure
 and our induction full of prosperous hope
hotspur lord mortimer and cousin glendower
 will you sit down
 and uncle worcester a plague upon it
 i have forgot the map
glendower no here it is
 sit cousin percy sit good cousin hotspur
 for by that name as oft as lancaster
 doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
 a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven
hotspur and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of
glendower i cannot blame him at my nativity
 the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
 of burning cressets and at my birth
 the frame and huge foundation of the earth
 shaked like a coward
hotspur why so it would have done at the same season if
 your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself
 had never been born
glendower i say the earth did shake when i was born
hotspur and i say the earth was not of my mind
 if you suppose as fearing you it shook
glendower the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble
hotspur o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
 and not in fear of your nativity
 diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
 in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
 is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
 by the imprisoning of unruly wind
 within her womb which for enlargement striving
 shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
 steeples and mossgrown towers at your birth
 our grandam earth having this distemperature
 in passion shook
glendower cousin of many men
 i do not bear these crossings give me leave
 to tell you once again that at my birth
 the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
 the goats ran from the mountains and the herds
 were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
 these signs have mark'd me extraordinary
 and all the courses of my life do show
 i am not in the roll of common men
 where is he living clipp'd in with the sea
 that chides the banks of england scotland wales
 which calls me pupil or hath read to me
 and bring him out that is but woman's son
 can trace me in the tedious ways of art
 and hold me pace in deep experiments
hotspur i think there's no man speaks better welsh
 i'll to dinner
mortimer peace cousin percy you will make him mad
glendower i can call spirits from the vasty deep
hotspur why so can i or so can any man
 but will they come when you do call for them
glendower why i can teach you cousin to command
 the devil
hotspur and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil
 by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil
 if thou have power to raise him bring him hither
 and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence
 o while you live tell truth and shame the devil
mortimer come come no more of this unprofitable chat
glendower three times hath henry bolingbroke made head
 against my power thrice from the banks of wye
 and sandybottom'd severn have i sent him
 bootless home and weatherbeaten back
hotspur home without boots and in foul weather too
 how scapes he agues in the devil's name
glendower come here's the map shall we divide our right
 according to our threefold order ta'en
mortimer the archdeacon hath divided it
 into three limits very equally
 england from trent and severn hitherto
 by south and east is to my part assign'd
 all westward wales beyond the severn shore
 and all the fertile land within that bound
 to owen glendower and dear coz to you
 the remnant northward lying off from trent
 and our indentures tripartite are drawn
 which being sealed interchangeably
 a business that this night may execute
 tomorrow cousin percy you and i
 and my good lord of worcester will set forth
 to meet your father and the scottish power
 as is appointed us at shrewsbury
 my father glendower is not ready yet
 not shall we need his help these fourteen days
 within that space you may have drawn together
 your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen
glendower a shorter time shall send me to you lords
 and in my conduct shall your ladies come
 from whom you now must steal and take no leave
 for there will be a world of water shed
 upon the parting of your wives and you
hotspur methinks my moiety north from burton here
 in quantity equals not one of yours
 see how this river comes me cranking in
 and cuts me from the best of all my land
 a huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out
 i'll have the current in this place damm'd up
 and here the smug and silver trent shall run
 in a new channel fair and evenly
 it shall not wind with such a deep indent
 to rob me of so rich a bottom here
glendower not wind it shall it must you see it doth
mortimer yea but
 mark how he bears his course and runs me up
 with like advantage on the other side
 gelding the opposed continent as much
 as on the other side it takes from you
earl of worcester yea but a little charge will trench him here
 and on this north side win this cape of land
 and then he runs straight and even
hotspur i'll have it so a little charge will do it
glendower i'll not have it alter'd
hotspur will not you
glendower no nor you shall not
hotspur who shall say me nay
glendower why that will i
hotspur let me not understand you then speak it in welsh
glendower i can speak english lord as well as you
 for i was train'd up in the english court
 where being but young i framed to the harp
 many an english ditty lovely well
 and gave the tongue a helpful ornament
 a virtue that was never seen in you
hotspur marry
 and i am glad of it with all my heart
 i had rather be a kitten and cry mew
 than one of these same metre balladmongers
 i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd
 or a dry wheel grate on the axletree
 and that would set my teeth nothing on edge
 nothing so much as mincing poetry
 tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag
glendower come you shall have trent turn'd
hotspur i do not care i'll give thrice so much land
 to any welldeserving friend
 but in the way of bargain mark ye me
 i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
 are the indentures drawn shall we be gone
glendower the moon shines fair you may away by night
 i'll haste the writer and withal
 break with your wives of your departure hence
 i am afraid my daughter will run mad
 so much she doteth on her mortimer
 exit glendower
mortimer fie cousin percy how you cross my father
hotspur i cannot choose sometime he angers me
 with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant
 of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies
 and of a dragon and a finless fish
 a clipwing'd griffin and a moulten raven
 a couching lion and a ramping cat
 and such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff
 as puts me from my faith i tell you what
 he held me last night at least nine hours
 in reckoning up the several devils names
 that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to'
 but mark'd him not a word o he is as tedious
 as a tired horse a railing wife
 worse than a smoky house i had rather live
 with cheese and garlic in a windmill far
 than feed on cates and have him talk to me
 in any summerhouse in christendom
mortimer in faith he is a worthy gentleman
 exceedingly well read and profited
 in strange concealments valiant as a lion
 and as wondrous affable and as bountiful
 as mines of india shall i tell you cousin
 he holds your temper in a high respect
 and curbs himself even of his natural scope
 when you come cross his humour faith he does
 i warrant you that man is not alive
 might so have tempted him as you have done
 without the taste of danger and reproof
 but do not use it oft let me entreat you
earl of worcester in faith my lord you are too wilfulblame
 and since your coming hither have done enough
 to put him quite beside his patience
 you must needs learn lord to amend this fault
 though sometimes it show greatness courage blood
 and that's the dearest grace it renders you
 yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
 defect of manners want of government
 pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
 the least of which haunting a nobleman
 loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
 upon the beauty of all parts besides
 beguiling them of commendation
hotspur well i am school'd good manners be your speed
 here come our wives and let us take our leave
 reenter glendower with the ladies
mortimer this is the deadly spite that angers me
 my wife can speak no english i no welsh
glendower my daughter weeps she will not part with you
 she'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars
mortimer good father tell her that she and my aunt percy
 shall follow in your conduct speedily
 glendower speaks to her in welsh and she
 answers him in the same
glendower she is desperate here a peevish selfwind harlotry
 one that no persuasion can do good upon
 the lady speaks in welsh
mortimer i understand thy looks that pretty welsh
 which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
 i am too perfect in and but for shame
 in such a parley should i answer thee
 the lady speaks again in welsh
 i understand thy kisses and thou mine
 and that's a feeling disputation
 but i will never be a truant love
 till i have learned thy language for thy tongue
 makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd
 sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower
 with ravishing division to her lute
glendower nay if you melt then will she run mad
 the lady speaks again in welsh
mortimer o i am ignorance itself in this
glendower she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
 and rest your gentle head upon her lap
 and she will sing the song that pleaseth you
 and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
 charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
 making such difference twixt wake and sleep
 as is the difference betwixt day and night
 the hour before the heavenlyharness'd team
 begins his golden progress in the east
mortimer with all my heart i'll sit and hear her sing
 by that time will our book i think be drawn
glendower do so
 and those musicians that shall play to you
 hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
 and straight they shall be here sit and attend
hotspur come kate thou art perfect in lying down come
 quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap
lady percy go ye giddy goose
 the music plays
hotspur now i perceive the devil understands welsh
 and tis no marvel he is so humorous
 by'r lady he is a good musician
lady percy then should you be nothing but musical for you are
 altogether governed by humours lie still ye thief
 and hear the lady sing in welsh
hotspur i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish
lady percy wouldst thou have thy head broken
hotspur no
lady percy then be still
hotspur neither'tis a woman's fault
lady percy now god help thee
hotspur to the welsh lady's bed
lady percy what's that
hotspur peace she sings
 here the lady sings a welsh song
hotspur come kate i'll have your song too
lady percy not mine in good sooth
hotspur not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a
 comfitmaker's wife not you in good sooth and
 as true as i live and as god shall mend me and
 as sure as day'
 and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
 as if thou never walk'st further than finsbury
 swear me kate like a lady as thou art
 a good mouthfilling oath and leave in sooth'
 and such protest of peppergingerbread
 to velvetguards and sundaycitizens
 come sing
lady percy i will not sing
hotspur tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast
 teacher an the indentures be drawn i'll away
 within these two hours and so come in when ye will
 exit
glendower come come lord mortimer you are as slow
 as hot lord percy is on fire to go
 by this our book is drawn we'll but seal
 and then to horse immediately
mortimer with all my heart

act iii
scene ii london the palace
 enter king henry iv prince henry and others
king henry iv lords give us leave the prince of wales and i
 must have some private conference but be near at hand
 for we shall presently have need of you
 exeunt lords
 i know not whether god will have it so
 for some displeasing service i have done
 that in his secret doom out of my blood
 he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me
 but thou dost in thy passages of life
 make me believe that thou art only mark'd
 for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
 to punish my mistreadings tell me else
 could such inordinate and low desires
 such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
 such barren pleasures rude society
 as thou art match'd withal and grafted to
 accompany the greatness of thy blood
 and hold their level with thy princely heart
prince henry so please your majesty i would i could
 quit all offences with as clear excuse
 as well as i am doubtless i can purge
 myself of many i am charged withal
 yet such extenuation let me beg
 as in reproof of many tales devised
 which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
 by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
 i may for some things true wherein my youth
 hath faulty wander'd and irregular
 find pardon on my true submission
king henry iv god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry
 at thy affections which do hold a wing
 quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
 thy place in council thou hast rudely lost
 which by thy younger brother is supplied
 and art almost an alien to the hearts
 of all the court and princes of my blood
 the hope and expectation of thy time
 is ruin'd and the soul of every man
 prophetically doth forethink thy fall
 had i so lavish of my presence been
 so commonhackney'd in the eyes of men
 so stale and cheap to vulgar company
 opinion that did help me to the crown
 had still kept loyal to possession
 and left me in reputeless banishment
 a fellow of no mark nor likelihood
 by being seldom seen i could not stir
 but like a comet i was wonder'd at
 that men would tell their children this is he'
 others would say where which is bolingbroke'
 and then i stole all courtesy from heaven
 and dress'd myself in such humility
 that i did pluck allegiance from men's hearts
 loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
 even in the presence of the crowned king
 thus did i keep my person fresh and new
 my presence like a robe pontifical
 ne'er seen but wonder'd at and so my state
 seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast
 and won by rareness such solemnity
 the skipping king he ambled up and down
 with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
 soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
 mingled his royalty with capering fools
 had his great name profaned with their scorns
 and gave his countenance against his name
 to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
 of every beardless vain comparative
 grew a companion to the common streets
 enfeoff'd himself to popularity
 that being daily swallow'd by men's eyes
 they surfeited with honey and began
 to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
 more than a little is by much too much
 so when he had occasion to be seen
 he was but as the cuckoo is in june
 heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
 as sick and blunted with community
 afford no extraordinary gaze
 such as is bent on sunlike majesty
 when it shines seldom in admiring eyes
 but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down
 slept in his face and render'd such aspect
 as cloudy men use to their adversaries
 being with his presence glutted gorged and full
 and in that very line harry standest thou
 for thou has lost thy princely privilege
 with vile participation not an eye
 but is aweary of thy common sight
 save mine which hath desired to see thee more
 which now doth that i would not have it do
 make blind itself with foolish tenderness
prince henry i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord
 be more myself
king henry iv for all the world
 as thou art to this hour was richard then
 when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh
 and even as i was then is percy now
 now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
 he hath more worthy interest to the state
 than thou the shadow of succession
 for of no right nor colour like to right
 he doth fill fields with harness in the realm
 turns head against the lion's armed jaws
 and being no more in debt to years than thou
 leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
 to bloody battles and to bruising arms
 what neverdying honour hath he got
 against renowned douglas whose high deeds
 whose hot incursions and great name in arms
 holds from all soldiers chief majority
 and military title capital
 through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ
 thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathling clothes
 this infant warrior in his enterprises
 discomfited great douglas ta'en him once
 enlarged him and made a friend of him
 to fill the mouth of deep defiance up
 and shake the peace and safety of our throne
 and what say you to this percy northumberland
 the archbishop's grace of york douglas mortimer
 capitulate against us and are up
 but wherefore do i tell these news to thee
 why harry do i tell thee of my foes
 which art my near'st and dearest enemy
 thou that art like enough through vassal fear
 base inclination and the start of spleen
 to fight against me under percy's pay
 to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
 to show how much thou art degenerate
prince henry do not think so you shall not find it so
 and god forgive them that so much have sway'd
 your majesty's good thoughts away from me
 i will redeem all this on percy's head
 and in the closing of some glorious day
 be bold to tell you that i am your son
 when i will wear a garment all of blood
 and stain my favours in a bloody mask
 which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it
 and that shall be the day whene'er it lights
 that this same child of honour and renown
 this gallant hotspur this allpraised knight
 and your unthoughtof harry chance to meet
 for every honour sitting on his helm
 would they were multitudes and on my head
 my shames redoubled for the time will come
 that i shall make this northern youth exchange
 his glorious deeds for my indignities
 percy is but my factor good my lord
 to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
 and i will call him to so strict account
 that he shall render every glory up
 yea even the slightest worship of his time
 or i will tear the reckoning from his heart
 this in the name of god i promise here
 the which if he be pleased i shall perform
 i do beseech your majesty may salve
 the longgrown wounds of my intemperance
 if not the end of life cancels all bands
 and i will die a hundred thousand deaths
 ere break the smallest parcel of this vow
king henry iv a hundred thousand rebels die in this
 thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
 enter blunt
 how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed
sir walter blunt so hath the business that i come to speak of
 lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word

scene i the rebel camp near shrewsbury
 enter hotspur worcester and douglas
hotspur well said my noble scot if speaking truth
 in this fine age were not thought flattery
 such attribution should the douglas have
 as not a soldier of this season's stamp
 should go so general current through the world
 by god i cannot flatter i do defy
 the tongues of soothers but a braver place
 in my heart's love hath no man than yourself
 nay task me to my word approve me lord
earl of douglas thou art the king of honour
 no man so potent breathes upon the ground
 but i will beard him
hotspur do so and tis well
 enter a messenger with letters
 what letters hast thou therei can but thank you
messenger these letters come from your father
hotspur letters from him why comes he not himself
messenger he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick
hotspur zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
 in such a rustling time who leads his power
 under whose government come they along
messenger his letters bear his mind not i my lord
earl of worcester i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
messenger he did my lord four days ere i set forth
 and at the time of my departure thence
 he was much fear'd by his physicians
earl of worcester i would the state of time had first been whole
 ere he by sickness had been visited
 his health was never better worth than now
hotspur sick now droop now this sickness doth infect
 the very lifeblood of our enterprise
 tis catching hither even to our camp
 he writes me here that inward sickness
 and that his friends by deputation could not
 so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet
 to lay so dangerous and dear a trust
 on any soul removed but on his own
 yet doth he give us bold advertisement
 that with our small conjunction we should on
 to see how fortune is disposed to us
 for as he writes there is no quailing now
 because the king is certainly possess'd
 of all our purposes what say you to it
earl of worcester your father's sickness is a maim to us
hotspur a perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off
 and yet in faith it is not his present want
 seems more than we shall find it were it good
 to set the exact wealth of all our states
 all at one cast to set so rich a main
 on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
 it were not good for therein should we read
 the very bottom and the soul of hope
 the very list the very utmost bound
 of all our fortunes
earl of douglas faith and so we should
 where now remains a sweet reversion
 we may boldly spend upon the hope of what
 is to come in
 a comfort of retirement lives in this
hotspur a rendezvous a home to fly unto
 if that the devil and mischance look big
 upon the maidenhead of our affairs
earl of worcester but yet i would your father had been here
 the quality and hair of our attempt
 brooks no division it will be thought
 by some that know not why he is away
 that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
 of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
 and think how such an apprehension
 may turn the tide of fearful faction
 and breed a kind of question in our cause
 for well you know we of the offering side
 must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
 and stop all sightholes every loop from whence
 the eye of reason may pry in upon us
 this absence of your father's draws a curtain
 that shows the ignorant a kind of fear
 before not dreamt of
hotspur you strain too far
 i rather of his absence make this use
 it lends a lustre and more great opinion
 a larger dare to our great enterprise
 than if the earl were here for men must think
 if we without his help can make a head
 to push against a kingdom with his help
 we shall o'erturn it topsyturvy down
 yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
earl of douglas as heart can think there is not such a word
 spoke of in scotland as this term of fear
 enter sir richard vernon
hotspur my cousin vernon welcome by my soul
vernon pray god my news be worth a welcome lord
 the earl of westmoreland seven thousand strong
 is marching hitherwards with him prince john
hotspur no harm what more
vernon and further i have learn'd
 the king himself in person is set forth
 or hitherwards intended speedily
 with strong and mighty preparation
hotspur he shall be welcome too where is his son
 the nimblefooted madcap prince of wales
 and his comrades that daff'd the world aside
 and bid it pass
vernon all furnish'd all in arms
 all plumed like estridges that with the wind
 baited like eagles having lately bathed
 glittering in golden coats like images
 as full of spirit as the month of may
 and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer
 wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
 i saw young harry with his beaver on
 his cuisses on his thighs gallantly arm'd
 rise from the ground like feather'd mercury
 and vaulted with such ease into his seat
 as if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds
 to turn and wind a fiery pegasus
 and witch the world with noble horsemanship
hotspur no more no more worse than the sun in march
 this praise doth nourish agues let them come
 they come like sacrifices in their trim
 and to the fireeyed maid of smoky war
 all hot and bleeding will we offer them
 the mailed mars shall on his altar sit
 up to the ears in blood i am on fire
 to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
 and yet not ours come let me taste my horse
 who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
 against the bosom of the prince of wales
 harry to harry shall hot horse to horse
 meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse
 o that glendower were come
vernon there is more news
 i learn'd in worcester as i rode along
 he cannot draw his power this fourteen days
earl of douglas that's the worst tidings that i hear of yet
worcester ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound
hotspur what may the king's whole battle reach unto
vernon to thirty thousand
hotspur forty let it be
 my father and glendower being both away
 the powers of us may serve so great a day
 come let us take a muster speedily
 doomsday is near die all die merrily
earl of douglas talk not of dying i am out of fear
 of death or death's hand for this onehalf year

falstaff if i be not ashamed of my soldiers i am a soused
 gurnet i have misused the king's press damnably
 i have got in exchange of a hundred and fifty
 soldiers three hundred and odd pounds i press me
 none but good householders yeoman's sons inquire
 me out contracted bachelors such as had been asked
 twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves
 as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum such as
 fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
 fowl or a hurt wildduck i pressed me none but such
 toastsandbutter with hearts in their bellies no
 bigger than pins heads and they have bought out
 their services and now my whole charge consists of
 ancients corporals lieutenants gentlemen of
 companies slaves as ragged as lazarus in the
 painted cloth where the glutton's dogs licked his
 sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but
 discarded unjust servingmen younger sons to
 younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers
 tradefallen the cankers of a calm world and a
 long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than
 an old faced ancient and such have i to fill up
 the rooms of them that have bought out their
 services that you would think that i had a hundred
 and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
 swinekeeping from eating draff and husks a mad
 fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded
 all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies no eye
 hath seen such scarecrows i'll not march through
 coventry with them that's flat nay and the
 villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had
 gyves on for indeed i had the most of them out of
 prison there's but a shirt and a half in all my
 company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
 together and thrown over the shoulders like an
 herald's coat without sleeves and the shirt to say
 the truth stolen from my host at saint alban's or
 the rednose innkeeper of daventry but that's all
 one they'll find linen enough on every hedge

 already made thee butter but tell me jack whose

scene iii the rebel camp near shrewsbury
 enter hotspur worcester douglas and vernon
hotspur we'll fight with him tonight
earl of worcester it may not be
earl of douglas you give him then the advantage
vernon not a whit
hotspur why say you so looks he not for supply
vernon so do we
hotspur his is certain ours is doubtful
earl of worcester good cousin be advised stir not tonight
vernon do not my lord
earl of douglas you do not counsel well
 you speak it out of fear and cold heart
vernon do me no slander douglas by my life
 and i dare well maintain it with my life
 if wellrespected honour bid me on
 i hold as little counsel with weak fear
 as you my lord or any scot that this day lives
 let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
 which of us fears
earl of douglas yea or tonight
vernon content
hotspur tonight say i
vernon come come it nay not be i wonder much
 being men of such great leading as you are
 that you foresee not what impediments
 drag back our expedition certain horse
 of my cousin vernon's are not yet come up
 your uncle worcester's horse came but today
 and now their pride and mettle is asleep
 their courage with hard labour tame and dull
 that not a horse is half the half of himself
hotspur so are the horses of the enemy
 in general journeybated and brought low
 the better part of ours are full of rest
earl of worcester the number of the king exceedeth ours
 for god's sake cousin stay till all come in
 the trumpet sounds a parley
 enter sir walter blunt
sir walter blunt i come with gracious offers from the king
 if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
hotspur welcome sir walter blunt and would to god
 you were of our determination
 some of us love you well and even those some
 envy your great deservings and good name
 because you are not of our quality
 but stand against us like an enemy
sir walter blunt and god defend but still i should stand so
 so long as out of limit and true rule
 you stand against anointed majesty
 but to my charge the king hath sent to know
 the nature of your griefs and whereupon
 you conjure from the breast of civil peace
 such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
 audacious cruelty if that the king
 have any way your good deserts forgot
 which he confesseth to be manifold
 he bids you name your griefs and with all speed
 you shall have your desires with interest
 and pardon absolute for yourself and these
 herein misled by your suggestion
hotspur the king is kind and well we know the king
 knows at what time to promise when to pay
 my father and my uncle and myself
 did give him that same royalty he wears
 and when he was not six and twenty strong
 sick in the world's regard wretched and low
 a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
 my father gave him welcome to the shore
 and when he heard him swear and vow to god
 he came but to be duke of lancaster
 to sue his livery and beg his peace
 with tears of innocency and terms of zeal
 my father in kind heart and pity moved
 swore him assistance and perform'd it too
 now when the lords and barons of the realm
 perceived northumberland did lean to him
 the more and less came in with cap and knee
 met him in boroughs cities villages
 attended him on bridges stood in lanes
 laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths
 gave him their heirs as pages follow'd him
 even at the heels in golden multitudes
 he presently as greatness knows itself
 steps me a little higher than his vow
 made to my father while his blood was poor
 upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh
 and now forsooth takes on him to reform
 some certain edicts and some strait decrees
 that lie too heavy on the commonwealth
 cries out upon abuses seems to weep
 over his country's wrongs and by this face
 this seeming brow of justice did he win
 the hearts of all that he did angle for
 proceeded further cut me off the heads
 of all the favourites that the absent king
 in deputation left behind him here
 when he was personal in the irish war
sir walter blunt tut i came not to hear this
hotspur then to the point
 in short time after he deposed the king
 soon after that deprived him of his life
 and in the neck of that task'd the whole state
 to make that worse suffer'd his kinsman march
 who is if every owner were well placed
 indeed his king to be engaged in wales
 there without ransom to lie forfeited
 disgraced me in my happy victories
 sought to entrap me by intelligence
 rated mine uncle from the councilboard
 in rage dismiss'd my father from the court
 broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
 and in conclusion drove us to seek out
 this head of safety and withal to pry
 into his title the which we find
 too indirect for long continuance
sir walter blunt shall i return this answer to the king
hotspur not so sir walter we'll withdraw awhile
 go to the king and let there be impawn'd
 some surety for a safe return again
 and in the morning early shall my uncle
 bring him our purposes and so farewell
sir walter blunt i would you would accept of grace and love
hotspur and may be so we shall
sir walter blunt pray god you do
