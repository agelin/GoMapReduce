 of better deeds tomorrow rest you happy

 made friends of them joining their force gainst caesar
 whose better issue in the war from italy
 upon the first encounter drave them
mark antony well what worst
messenger the nature of bad news infects the teller
mark antony when it concerns the fool or coward on
 things that are past are done with me tis thus
 who tells me true though in his tale lie death
 i hear him as he flatter'd
messenger labienus
 this is stiff newshath with his parthian force
 extended asia from euphrates
 his conquering banner shook from syria
 to lydia and to ionia whilst
mark antony antony thou wouldst say
messenger o my lord
mark antony speak to me home mince not the general tongue
 name cleopatra as she is call'd in rome
 rail thou in fulvia's phrase and taunt my faults
 with such full licence as both truth and malice
 have power to utter o then we bring forth weeds
 when our quick minds lie still and our ills told us
 is as our earing fare thee well awhile
messenger at your noble pleasure
 exit
mark antony from sicyon ho the news speak there
first attendant the man from sicyonis there such an one
second attendant he stays upon your will

second messenger fulvia thy wife is dead
mark antony where died she
second messenger in sicyon
 her length of sickness with what else more serious
 importeth thee to know this bears
 gives a letter
mark antony forbear me
 exit second messenger
 there's a great spirit gone thus did i desire it
 what our contempt doth often hurl from us
 we wish it ours again the present pleasure
 by revolution lowering does become
 the opposite of itself she's good being gone
 the hand could pluck her back that shoved her on
 i must from this enchanting queen break off
 ten thousand harms more than the ills i know
 my idleness doth hatch how now enobarbus
 reenter domitius enobarbus
domitius enobarbus what's your pleasure sir
mark antony i must with haste from hence
domitius enobarbus why then we kill all our women
 we see how mortal an unkindness is to them
 if they suffer our departure death's the word
mark antony i must be gone
domitius enobarbus under a compelling occasion let women die it were
 pity to cast them away for nothing though between
 them and a great cause they should be esteemed
 nothing cleopatra catching but the least noise of
 this dies instantly i have seen her die twenty
 times upon far poorer moment i do think there is
 mettle in death which commits some loving act upon
 her she hath such a celerity in dying
mark antony she is cunning past man's thought
 exit alexas
domitius enobarbus alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but
 the finest part of pure love we cannot call her
 winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater
 storms and tempests than almanacs can report this
 cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a
 shower of rain as well as jove
mark antony would i had never seen her
domitius enobarbus o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
 of work which not to have been blest withal would
 have discredited your travel
mark antony fulvia is dead
domitius enobarbus sir
mark antony fulvia is dead
domitius enobarbus fulvia
mark antony dead
domitius enobarbus why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice when
 it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
 from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth
 comforting therein that when old robes are worn
 out there are members to make new if there were
 no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut
 and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned
 with consolation your old smock brings forth a new
 petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion
 that should water this sorrow
mark antony the business she hath broached in the state
 cannot endure my absence
domitius enobarbus and the business you have broached here cannot be
 without you especially that of cleopatra's which
 wholly depends on your abode
mark antony no more light answers let our officers
 have notice what we purpose i shall break
 the cause of our expedience to the queen
 and get her leave to part for not alone
 the death of fulvia with more urgent touches
 do strongly speak to us but the letters too
 of many our contriving friends in rome
 petition us at home sextus pompeius
 hath given the dare to caesar and commands
 the empire of the sea our slippery people
 whose love is never link'd to the deserver
 till his deserts are past begin to throw
 pompey the great and all his dignities
 upon his son who high in name and power
 higher than both in blood and life stands up
 for the main soldier whose quality going on
 the sides o the world may danger much is breeding
 which like the courser's hair hath yet but life
 and not a serpent's poison say our pleasure
 to such whose place is under us requires
 our quick remove from hence
domitius enobarbus i shall do't

charmian i did not see him since
cleopatra see where he is who's with him what he does
 i did not send you if you find him sad

 that i am sudden sick quick and return

charmian madam methinks if you did love him dearly
 you do not hold the method to enforce
 the like from him
cleopatra what should i do i do not

cleopatra help me away dear charmian i shall fall
 it cannot be thus long the sides of nature

cleopatra pray you stand further from me
mark antony what's the matter
cleopatra i know by that same eye there's some good news
 what says the married woman you may go
 would she had never given you leave to come
 let her not say tis i that keep you here
 i have no power upon you hers you are
mark antony the gods best know
cleopatra o never was there queen
 so mightily betray'd yet at the first
 i saw the treasons planted
mark antony cleopatra
cleopatra why should i think you can be mine and true
 though you in swearing shake the throned gods
 who have been false to fulvia riotous madness
 to be entangled with those mouthmade vows
 which break themselves in swearing
mark antony most sweet queen
cleopatra nay pray you seek no colour for your going
 but bid farewell and go when you sued staying
 then was the time for words no going then
 eternity was in our lips and eyes
 bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor
 but was a race of heaven they are so still
 or thou the greatest soldier of the world
 art turn'd the greatest liar
mark antony how now lady
cleopatra i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know
 there were a heart in egypt
mark antony hear me queen
 the strong necessity of time commands
 our services awhile but my full heart
 remains in use with you our italy
 shines o'er with civil swords sextus pompeius
 makes his approaches to the port of rome
 equality of two domestic powers
 breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength
 are newly grown to love the condemn'd pompey
 rich in his father's honour creeps apace
 into the hearts of such as have not thrived
 upon the present state whose numbers threaten
 and quietness grown sick of rest would purge
 by any desperate change my more particular
 and that which most with you should safe my going
 is fulvia's death
cleopatra though age from folly could not give me freedom
 it does from childishness can fulvia die
mark antony she's dead my queen
 look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
 the garboils she awaked at the last best
 see when and where she died
cleopatra o most false love
 where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
 with sorrowful water now i see i see
 in fulvia's death how mine received shall be
mark antony quarrel no more but be prepared to know
 the purposes i bear which are or cease
 as you shall give the advice by the fire
 that quickens nilus slime i go from hence
 thy soldier servant making peace or war
 as thou affect'st
cleopatra cut my lace charmian come
 but let it be i am quickly ill and well
 so antony loves
mark antony my precious queen forbear
 and give true evidence to his love which stands
 an honourable trial
cleopatra so fulvia told me
 i prithee turn aside and weep for her
 then bid adieu to me and say the tears
 belong to egypt good now play one scene
 of excellent dissembling and let it look
 life perfect honour
mark antony you'll heat my blood no more
cleopatra you can do better yet but this is meetly
mark antony now by my sword
cleopatra and target still he mends
 but this is not the best look prithee charmian
 how this herculean roman does become
 the carriage of his chafe
mark antony i'll leave you lady
cleopatra courteous lord one word
 sir you and i must part but that's not it
 sir you and i have loved but there's not it
 that you know well something it is i would
 o my oblivion is a very antony
 and i am all forgotten
mark antony but that your royalty
 holds idleness your subject i should take you
 for idleness itself
cleopatra tis sweating labour
 to bear such idleness so near the heart
 as cleopatra this but sir forgive me
 since my becomings kill me when they do not
 eye well to you your honour calls you hence
 therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
 and all the gods go with you upon your sword
 sit laurel victory and smooth success
 be strew'd before your feet

scene iv rome octavius caesar's house
 enter octavius caesar reading a letter lepidus
 and their train
octavius caesar you may see lepidus and henceforth know
 it is not caesar's natural vice to hate
 our great competitor from alexandria
 this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
 the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike
 than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy
 more womanly than he hardly gave audience or
 vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there
 a man who is the abstract of all faults
 that all men follow
lepidus i must not think there are
 evils enow to darken all his goodness
 his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
 more fiery by night's blackness hereditary
 rather than purchased what he cannot change
 than what he chooses
octavius caesar you are too indulgent let us grant it is not
 amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy
 to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit
 and keep the turn of tippling with a slave
 to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
 with knaves that smell of sweat say this
 becomes him
 as his composure must be rare indeed
 whom these things cannot blemishyet must antony
 no way excuse his soils when we do bear
 so great weight in his lightness if he fill'd
 his vacancy with his voluptuousness
 full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
 call on him for't but to confound such time
 that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
 as his own state and ours'tis to be chid
 as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
 pawn their experience to their present pleasure
 and so rebel to judgment
 enter a messenger
lepidus here's more news
messenger thy biddings have been done and every hour
 most noble caesar shalt thou have report
 how tis abroad pompey is strong at sea
 and it appears he is beloved of those
 that only have fear'd caesar to the ports
 the discontents repair and men's reports
 give him much wrong'd
octavius caesar i should have known no less
 it hath been taught us from the primal state
 that he which is was wish'd until he were
 and the ebb'd man ne'er loved till ne'er worth love
 comes dear'd by being lack'd this common body
 like to a vagabond flag upon the stream
 goes to and back lackeying the varying tide
 to rot itself with motion
messenger caesar i bring thee word
 menecrates and menas famous pirates
 make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
 with keels of every kind many hot inroads
 they make in italy the borders maritime
 lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt
 no vessel can peep forth but tis as soon
 taken as seen for pompey's name strikes more
 than could his war resisted
octavius caesar antony
 leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once
 wast beaten from modena where thou slew'st
 hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel
 did famine follow whom thou fought'st against
 though daintily brought up with patience more
 than savages could suffer thou didst drink
 the stale of horses and the gilded puddle
 which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign
 the roughest berry on the rudest hedge
 yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets
 the barks of trees thou browsed'st on the alps
 it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
 which some did die to look on and all this
 it wounds thine honour that i speak it now
 was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
 so much as lank'd not
lepidus tis pity of him
octavius caesar let his shames quickly
 drive him to rome tis time we twain
 did show ourselves i the field and to that end
 assemble we immediate council pompey
 thrives in our idleness
lepidus tomorrow caesar
 i shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
 both what by sea and land i can be able
 to front this present time
octavius caesar till which encounter
 it is my business too farewell

 that am with phoebus amorous pinches black

 when thou wast here above the ground i was
 a morsel for a monarch and great pompey
 would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow
 there would he anchor his aspect and die
 with looking on his life
 enter alexas from octavius caesar
alexas sovereign of egypt hail
cleopatra how much unlike art thou mark antony
 yet coming from him that great medicine hath
 with his tinct gilded thee
 how goes it with my brave mark antony
alexas last thing he did dear queen
 he kiss'dthe last of many doubled kisses
 this orient pearl his speech sticks in my heart
cleopatra mine ear must pluck it thence
alexas good friend quoth he
 say the firm roman to great egypt sends
 this treasure of an oyster at whose foot
 to mend the petty present i will piece
 her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east
 say thou shall call her mistress so he nodded
 and soberly did mount an armgaunt steed
 who neigh'd so high that what i would have spoke
 was beastly dumb'd by him
cleopatra what was he sad or merry
alexas like to the time o the year between the extremes
 of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
cleopatra o welldivided disposition note him
 note him good charmian tis the man but note him
 he was not sad for he would shine on those
 that make their looks by his he was not merry
 which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
 in egypt with his joy but between both
 o heavenly mingle be'st thou sad or merry
 the violence of either thee becomes
 so does it no man else met'st thou my posts
alexas ay madam twenty several messengers
 why do you send so thick
cleopatra who's born that day
 when i forget to send to antony
 shall die a beggar ink and paper charmian
 welcome my good alexas did i charmian
 ever love caesar so

pompey whiles we are suitors to their throne decays

menecrates we ignorant of ourselves
 beg often our own harms which the wise powers
 deny us for our good so find we profit
 by losing of our prayers
pompey i shall do well
 the people love me and the sea is mine
 my powers are crescent and my auguring hope
 says it will come to the full mark antony
 in egypt sits at dinner and will make
 no wars without doors caesar gets money where
 he loses hearts lepidus flatters both
 of both is flatter'd but he neither loves
 nor either cares for him
menas caesar and lepidus
 are in the field a mighty strength they carry
pompey where have you this tis false

pompey he dreams i know they are in rome together
 looking for antony but all the charms of love
 salt cleopatra soften thy waned lip

varrius this is most certain that i shall deliver

pompey i could have given less matter

 this amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
 for such a petty war his soldiership
 is twice the other twain but let us rear
 the higher our opinion that our stirring
 can from the lap of egypt's widow pluck
 the ne'erlustwearied antony
menas i cannot hope
 caesar and antony shall well greet together
 his wife that's dead did trespasses to caesar
 his brother warr'd upon him although i think
 not moved by antony
pompey i know not menas
 how lesser enmities may give way to greater
 were't not that we stand up against them all
 twere pregnant they should square between
 themselves
 for they have entertained cause enough
 to draw their swords but how the fear of us

domitius enobarbus i shall entreat him
 to answer like himself if caesar move him
 let antony look over caesar's head
 and speak as loud as mars by jupiter
 were i the wearer of antonius beard
 i would not shave't today
lepidus tis not a time
 for private stomaching
domitius enobarbus every time
 serves for the matter that is then born in't
lepidus but small to greater matters must give way
domitius enobarbus not if the small come first
lepidus your speech is passion

 mecaenas ask agrippa
lepidus noble friends
 that which combined us was most great and let not
 a leaner action rend us what's amiss
 may it be gently heard when we debate
 our trivial difference loud we do commit
 murder in healing wounds then noble partners
 the rather for i earnestly beseech
 touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms
 nor curstness grow to the matter
mark antony tis spoken well
 were we before our armies and to fight
 i should do thus
 flourish
octavius caesar welcome to rome
mark antony thank you
octavius caesar sit
mark antony sit sir
octavius caesar nay then
mark antony i learn you take things ill which are not so
 or being concern you not
octavius caesar i must be laugh'd at
 if or for nothing or a little i
 should say myself offended and with you
 chiefly i the world more laugh'd at that i should
 once name you derogately when to sound your name
 it not concern'd me
mark antony my being in egypt caesar
 what was't to you
octavius caesar no more than my residing here at rome
 might be to you in egypt yet if you there
 did practise on my state your being in egypt
 might be my question
mark antony how intend you practised
octavius caesar you may be pleased to catch at mine intent
 by what did here befal me your wife and brother
 made wars upon me and their contestation
 was theme for you you were the word of war
mark antony you do mistake your business my brother never
 did urge me in his act i did inquire it
 and have my learning from some true reports
 that drew their swords with you did he not rather
 discredit my authority with yours
 and make the wars alike against my stomach
 having alike your cause of this my letters
 before did satisfy you if you'll patch a quarrel
 as matter whole you have not to make it with
 it must not be with this
octavius caesar you praise yourself
 by laying defects of judgment to me but
 you patch'd up your excuses
mark antony not so not so
 i know you could not lack i am certain on't
 very necessity of this thought that i
 your partner in the cause gainst which he fought
 could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
 which fronted mine own peace as for my wife
 i would you had her spirit in such another
 the third o the world is yours which with a snaffle
 you may pace easy but not such a wife
domitius enobarbus would we had all such wives that the men might go
 to wars with the women
mark antony so much uncurbable her garboils caesar
 made out of her impatience which not wanted
 shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant
 did you too much disquiet for that you must
 but say i could not help it
octavius caesar i wrote to you
 when rioting in alexandria you
 did pocket up my letters and with taunts
 did gibe my missive out of audience
mark antony sir
 he fell upon me ere admitted then
 three kings i had newly feasted and did want
 of what i was i the morning but next day
 i told him of myself which was as much
 as to have ask'd him pardon let this fellow
 be nothing of our strife if we contend
 out of our question wipe him
octavius caesar you have broken
 the article of your oath which you shall never
 have tongue to charge me with
lepidus soft caesar
mark antony no
 lepidus let him speak
 the honour is sacred which he talks on now
 supposing that i lack'd it but on caesar
 the article of my oath
octavius caesar to lend me arms and aid when i required them
 the which you both denied
mark antony neglected rather
 and then when poison'd hours had bound me up
 from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may
 i'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty
 shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
 work without it truth is that fulvia
 to have me out of egypt made wars here
 for which myself the ignorant motive do
 so far ask pardon as befits mine honour
 to stoop in such a case
lepidus tis noble spoken
mecaenas if it might please you to enforce no further
 the griefs between ye to forget them quite
 were to remember that the present need
 speaks to atone you
lepidus worthily spoken mecaenas
domitius enobarbus or if you borrow one another's love for the
 instant you may when you hear no more words of
 pompey return it again you shall have time to
 wrangle in when you have nothing else to do
mark antony thou art a soldier only speak no more
domitius enobarbus that truth should be silent i had almost forgot
mark antony you wrong this presence therefore speak no more
domitius enobarbus go to then your considerate stone
octavius caesar i do not much dislike the matter but
 the manner of his speech for't cannot be
 we shall remain in friendship our conditions
 so differing in their acts yet if i knew
 what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
 o the world i would pursue it
agrippa give me leave caesar
octavius caesar speak agrippa
agrippa thou hast a sister by the mother's side
 admired octavia great mark antony
 is now a widower
octavius caesar say not so agrippa
 if cleopatra heard you your reproof
 were well deserved of rashness
mark antony i am not married caesar let me hear
 agrippa further speak
agrippa to hold you in perpetual amity
 to make you brothers and to knit your hearts
 with an unslipping knot take antony
 octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
 no worse a husband than the best of men
 whose virtue and whose general graces speak
 that which none else can utter by this marriage
 all little jealousies which now seem great
 and all great fears which now import their dangers
 would then be nothing truths would be tales
 where now half tales be truths her love to both
 would each to other and all loves to both
 draw after her pardon what i have spoke
 for tis a studied not a present thought
 by duty ruminated
mark antony will caesar speak
octavius caesar not till he hears how antony is touch'd
 with what is spoke already
mark antony what power is in agrippa
 if i would say agrippa be it so'
 to make this good
octavius caesar the power of caesar and
 his power unto octavia
mark antony may i never
 to this good purpose that so fairly shows
 dream of impediment let me have thy hand
 further this act of grace and from this hour
 the heart of brothers govern in our loves
 and sway our great designs
octavius caesar there is my hand
 a sister i bequeath you whom no brother
 did ever love so dearly let her live
 to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
 fly off our loves again
lepidus happily amen
mark antony i did not think to draw my sword gainst pompey
 for he hath laid strange courtesies and great
 of late upon me i must thank him only
 lest my remembrance suffer ill report
 at heel of that defy him
lepidus time calls upon's
 of us must pompey presently be sought
 or else he seeks out us
mark antony where lies he
octavius caesar about the mount misenum
mark antony what is his strength by land
octavius caesar great and increasing but by sea
 he is an absolute master
mark antony so is the fame
 would we had spoke together haste we for it
 yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
 the business we have talk'd of
octavius caesar with most gladness
 and do invite you to my sister's view
 whither straight i'll lead you

mecaenas welcome from egypt sir
domitius enobarbus half the heart of caesar worthy mecaenas my
 honourable friend agrippa
agrippa good enobarbus
mecaenas we have cause to be glad that matters are so well
 digested you stayed well by t in egypt
domitius enobarbus ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and
 made the night light with drinking
mecaenas eight wildboars roasted whole at a breakfast and
 but twelve persons there is this true
domitius enobarbus this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more
 monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
mecaenas she's a most triumphant lady if report be square to
 her
domitius enobarbus when she first met mark antony she pursed up
 his heart upon the river of cydnus
agrippa there she appeared indeed or my reporter devised
 well for her
domitius enobarbus i will tell you
 the barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne
 burn'd on the water the poop was beaten gold
 purple the sails and so perfumed that
 the winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver
 which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
 the water which they beat to follow faster
 as amorous of their strokes for her own person
 it beggar'd all description she did lie
 in her pavilionclothofgold of tissue
 o'erpicturing that venus where we see
 the fancy outwork nature on each side her
 stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids
 with diverscolour'd fans whose wind did seem
 to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
 and what they undid did
agrippa o rare for antony
domitius enobarbus her gentlewomen like the nereides
 so many mermaids tended her i the eyes
 and made their bends adornings at the helm
 a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle
 swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands
 that yarely frame the office from the barge
 a strange invisible perfume hits the sense
 of the adjacent wharfs the city cast
 her people out upon her and antony
 enthroned i the marketplace did sit alone
 whistling to the air which but for vacancy
 had gone to gaze on cleopatra too
 and made a gap in nature
agrippa rare egyptian
domitius enobarbus upon her landing antony sent to her
 invited her to supper she replied
 it should be better he became her guest
 which she entreated our courteous antony
 whom ne'er the word of no woman heard speak
 being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast
 and for his ordinary pays his heart
 for what his eyes eat only
agrippa royal wench
 she made great caesar lay his sword to bed
 he plough'd her and she cropp'd
domitius enobarbus i saw her once
 hop forty paces through the public street
 and having lost her breath she spoke and panted
 that she did make defect perfection
 and breathless power breathe forth
mecaenas now antony must leave her utterly
domitius enobarbus never he will not
 age cannot wither her nor custom stale
 her infinite variety other women cloy
 the appetites they feed but she makes hungry
 where most she satisfies for vilest things
 become themselves in her that the holy priests
 bless her when she is riggish
mecaenas if beauty wisdom modesty can settle
 the heart of antony octavia is
 a blessed lottery to him
agrippa let us go
 good enobarbus make yourself my guest
 whilst you abide here

 and carry back to sicily much tall youth
 that else must perish here
pompey to you all three
 the senators alone of this great world
 chief factors for the gods i do not know
 wherefore my father should revengers want
 having a son and friends since julius caesar
 who at philippi the good brutus ghosted
 there saw you labouring for him what was't
 that moved pale cassius to conspire and what
 made the allhonour'd honest roman brutus
 with the arm'd rest courtiers and beauteous freedom
 to drench the capitol but that they would
 have one man but a man and that is it
 hath made me rig my navy at whose burthen
 the anger'd ocean foams with which i meant
 to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful rome
 cast on my noble father
octavius caesar take your time
mark antony thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails
 we'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st
 how much we do o'ercount thee
pompey at land indeed
 thou dost o'ercount me of my father's house

lepidus be pleased to tell us
 for this is from the presenthow you take
 the offers we have sent you
octavius caesar there's the point
mark antony which do not be entreated to but weigh
 what it is worth embraced

 of sicily sardinia and i must
 rid all the sea of pirates then to send
 measures of wheat to rome this greed upon

lepidus 
pompey know then
 i came before you here a man prepared
 to take this offer but mark antony
 put me to some impatience though i lose
 the praise of it by telling you must know
 when caesar and your brother were at blows
 your mother came to sicily and did find
 her welcome friendly
mark antony i have heard it pompey
 and am well studied for a liberal thanks
 which i do owe you
pompey let me have your hand
 i did not think sir to have met you here
mark antony the beds i the east are soft and thanks to you
 that call'd me timelier than my purpose hither
 for i have gain'd by t
octavius caesar since i saw you last
 there is a change upon you
pompey well i know not
 what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face
 but in my bosom shall she never come
 to make my heart her vassal
lepidus well met here
pompey i hope so lepidus thus we are agreed
 i crave our composition may be written
 and seal'd between us
octavius caesar that's the next to do
pompey we'll feast each other ere we part and let's
 draw lots who shall begin
mark antony that will i pompey
pompey no antony take the lot but first
 or last your fine egyptian cookery

 grew fat with feasting there
mark antony you have heard much
pompey i have fair meanings sir

domitius enobarbus no more of that he did so
pompey what i pray you
domitius enobarbus a certain queen to caesar in a mattress
pompey i know thee now how farest thou soldier
domitius enobarbus well
 and well am like to do for i perceive
 four feasts are toward
pompey let me shake thy hand
 i never hated thee i have seen thee fight
 when i have envied thy behavior
domitius enobarbus sir
 i never loved you much but i ha praised ye
 when you have well deserved ten times as much
 as i have said you did
pompey enjoy thy plainness

domitius enobarbus you have done well by water
menas and you by land
domitius enobarbus i will praise any man that will praise me though it
 cannot be denied what i have done by land
menas nor what i have done by water
domitius enobarbus yes something you can deny for your own
 safety you have been a great thief by sea
menas and you by land
domitius enobarbus there i deny my land service but give me your
 hand menas if our eyes had authority here they
 might take two thieves kissing
menas all men's faces are true whatsome'er their hands are
domitius enobarbus but there is never a fair woman has a true face
menas no slander they steal hearts
domitius enobarbus we came hither to fight with you
menas for my part i am sorry it is turned to a drinking
 pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
domitius enobarbus if he do sure he cannot weep't back again
menas you've said sir we looked not for mark antony
 here pray you is he married to cleopatra
domitius enobarbus caesar's sister is called octavia
menas true sir she was the wife of caius marcellus
domitius enobarbus but she is now the wife of marcus antonius
menas pray ye sir
domitius enobarbus tis true
menas then is caesar and he for ever knit together
domitius enobarbus if i were bound to divine of this unity i would
 not prophesy so
menas i think the policy of that purpose made more in the
 marriage than the love of the parties
domitius enobarbus i think so too but you shall find the band that
 seems to tie their friendship together will be the
 very strangler of their amity octavia is of a
 holy cold and still conversation
menas who would not have his wife so
domitius enobarbus not he that himself is not so which is mark antony
 he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the
 sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as
 i said before that which is the strength of their
 amity shall prove the immediate author of their
 variance antony will use his affection where it is
 he married but his occasion here

 i have a health for you

lepidus what colour is it of
mark antony of it own colour too
lepidus tis a strange serpent
mark antony tis so and the tears of it are wet

 very epicure

ventidius o silius silius
 i have done enough a lower place note well
 may make too great an act for learn this silius
 better to leave undone than by our deed
 acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away
 caesar and antony have ever won
 more in their officer than person sossius
 one of my place in syria his lieutenant
 for quick accumulation of renown
 which he achieved by the minute lost his favour
 who does i the wars more than his captain can
 becomes his captain's captain and ambition
 the soldier's virtue rather makes choice of loss
 than gain which darkens him
 i could do more to do antonius good
 but twould offend him and in his offence
 should my performance perish
silius thou hast ventidius
 that
 without the which a soldier and his sword
 grants scarce distinction thou wilt write to antony
ventidius i'll humbly signify what in his name
 that magical word of war we have effected
 how with his banners and his wellpaid ranks

octavius caesar the people know it and have now received
 his accusations
agrippa who does he accuse
octavius caesar caesar and that having in sicily
 sextus pompeius spoil'd we had not rated him
 his part o the isle then does he say he lent me
 some shipping unrestored lastly he frets
 that lepidus of the triumvirate
 should be deposed and being that we detain

agrippa sir this should be answer'd
octavius caesar tis done already and the messenger gone
 i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel
 that he his high authority abused
 and did deserve his change for what i have conquer'd
 i grant him part but then in his armenia
 and other of his conquer'd kingdoms i

 should have an army for an usher and
 the neighs of horse to tell of her approach
 long ere she did appear the trees by the way
 should have borne men and expectation fainted
 longing for what it had not nay the dust
 should have ascended to the roof of heaven
 raised by your populous troops but you are come
 a marketmaid to rome and have prevented
 the ostentation of our love which left unshown
 is often left unloved we should have met you
 by sea and land supplying every stage
 with an augmented greeting
octavia good my lord
 to come thus was i not constrain'd but did
 on my free will my lord mark antony
 hearing that you prepared for war acquainted
 my grieved ear withal whereon i begg'd
 his pardon for return
octavius caesar which soon he granted
 being an obstruct tween his lust and him

 of us and those that love you best of comfort
 and ever welcome to us
agrippa welcome lady

 lord of his reason what though you fled
 from that great face of war whose several ranges
 frighted each other why should he follow
 the itch of his affection should not then
 have nick'd his captainship at such a point
 when half to half the world opposed he being
 the meered question twas a shame no less
 than was his loss to course your flying flags
 and leave his navy gazing

euphronius ay my lord
mark antony the queen shall then have courtesy so she

 exeunt mark antony and euphronius
domitius enobarbus aside yes like enough highbattled caesar will
 unstate his happiness and be staged to the show
 against a sworder i see men's judgments are

 knowing all measures the full caesar will
 answer his emptiness caesar thou hast subdued
 his judgment too

domitius enobarbus aside mine honesty and i begin to square

 will leap to be his friend for us you know

thyreus so
 thus then thou most renown'd caesar entreats
 not to consider in what case thou stand'st
 further than he is caesar
cleopatra go on right royal
thyreus he knows that you embrace not antony
 as you did love but as you fear'd him
cleopatra o
thyreus the scars upon your honour therefore he
 does pity as constrained blemishes
 not as deserved
cleopatra he is a god and knows
 what is most right mine honour was not yielded
 but conquer'd merely
domitius enobarbus aside to be sure of that
 i will ask antony sir sir thou art so leaky
 that we must leave thee to thy sinking for
 thy dearest quit thee
 exit
thyreus shall i say to caesar
 what you require of him for he partly begs
 to be desired to give it much would please him

 wisdom and fortune combating together
 if that the former dare but what it can

 and whine aloud for mercy take him hence

 bring him again this jack of caesar's shall
 bear us an errand to him
 exeunt attendants with thyreus
 you were half blasted ere i knew you ha
 have i my pillow left unpress'd in rome
 forborne the getting of a lawful race
 and by a gem of women to be abused
 by one that looks on feeders
cleopatra good my lord
mark antony you have been a boggler ever
 but when we in our viciousness grow hard
 o misery on'tthe wise gods seel our eyes
 in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
 adore our errors laugh at's while we strut
 to our confusion
cleopatra o is't come to this
mark antony i found you as a morsel cold upon
 dead caesar's trencher nay you were a fragment
 of cneius pompey's besides what hotter hours
 unregister'd in vulgar fame you have
 luxuriously pick'd out for i am sure
 though you can guess what temperance should be
 you know not what it is
cleopatra wherefore is this
mark antony to let a fellow that will take rewards
 and say god quit you be familiar with
 my playfellow your hand this kingly seal
 and plighter of high hearts o that i were
 upon the hill of basan to outroar
 the horned herd for i have savage cause
 and to proclaim it civilly were like
 a halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
 for being yare about him
 reenter attendants with thyreus
 is he whipp'd
first attendant soundly my lord
mark antony cried he and begg'd a pardon
first attendant he did ask favour
mark antony if that thy father live let him repent
 thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
 to follow caesar in his triumph since
 thou hast been whipp'd for following him henceforth
 the white hand of a lady fever thee
 shake thou to look on t get thee back to caesar
 tell him thy entertainment look thou say
 he makes me angry with him for he seems
 proud and disdainful harping on what i am
 not what he knew i was he makes me angry
 and at this time most easy tis to do't
 when my good stars that were my former guides
 have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
 into the abysm of hell if he mislike
 my speech and what is done tell him he has
 hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
 he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
 as he shall like to quit me urge it thou
 hence with thy stripes begone
 exit thyreus
cleopatra have you done yet
mark antony alack our terrene moon
 is now eclipsed and it portends alone
 the fall of antony
cleopatra i must stay his time
mark antony to flatter caesar would you mingle eyes
 with one that ties his points
cleopatra not know me yet
mark antony coldhearted toward me
cleopatra ah dear if i be so
 from my cold heart let heaven engender hail
 and poison it in the source and the first stone
 drop in my neck as it determines so
 dissolve my life the next caesarion smite
 till by degrees the memory of my womb
 together with my brave egyptians all
 by the discandying of this pelleted storm
 lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile
 have buried them for prey
mark antony i am satisfied
 caesar sits down in alexandria where
 i will oppose his fate our force by land
 hath nobly held our sever'd navy too
 have knit again and fleet threatening most sealike
 where hast thou been my heart dost thou hear lady
 if from the field i shall return once more
 to kiss these lips i will appear in blood
 i and my sword will earn our chronicle
 there's hope in't yet
cleopatra that's my brave lord
mark antony i will be treblesinew'd hearted breathed
 and fight maliciously for when mine hours
 were nice and lucky men did ransom lives
 of me for jests but now i'll set my teeth
 and send to darkness all that stop me come
 let's have one other gaudy night call to me
 all my sad captains fill our bowls once more
 let's mock the midnight bell
cleopatra it is my birthday
 i had thought to have held it poor but since my lord
 is antony again i will be cleopatra
mark antony we will yet do well
cleopatra call all his noble captains to my lord
mark antony do so we'll speak to them and tonight i'll force
 the wine peep through their scars come on my queen
 there's sap in't yet the next time i do fight
 i'll make death love me for i will contend
 even with his pestilent scythe
 exeunt all but domitius enobarbus
domitius enobarbus now he'll outstare the lightning to be furious
 is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood
 the dove will peck the estridge and i see still
 a diminution in our captain's brain
 restores his heart when valour preys on reason
 it eats the sword it fights with i will seek
 some way to leave him

 all strange and terrible events are welcome
 but comforts we despise our size of sorrow
 proportion'd to our cause must be as great
 as that which makes it
 enter below diomedes
 how now is he dead
diomedes his death's upon him but not dead
 look out o the other side your monument
 his guard have brought him thither
 enter below mark antony borne by the guard
cleopatra o sun
 burn the great sphere thou movest in
 darkling stand
 the varying shore o the world o antony
 antony antony help charmian help iras help
 help friends below let's draw him hither
mark antony peace
 not caesar's valour hath o'erthrown antony
 but antony's hath triumph'd on itself
cleopatra so it should be that none but antony
 should conquer antony but woe tis so
mark antony i am dying egypt dying only
 i here importune death awhile until
 of many thousand kisses the poor last
 i lay up thy lips
cleopatra i dare not dear
 dear my lord pardoni dare not
 lest i be taken not the imperious show
 of the fullfortuned caesar ever shall
 be brooch'd with me if knife drugs
 serpents have
 edge sting or operation i am safe
 your wife octavia with her modest eyes
 and still conclusion shall acquire no honour
 demuring upon me but come come antony
 help me my womenwe must draw thee up
 assist good friends
mark antony o quick or i am gone
cleopatra here's sport indeed how heavy weighs my lord
 our strength is all gone into heaviness
 that makes the weight had i great juno's power
 the strongwing'd mercury should fetch thee up
 and set thee by jove's side yet come a little
 wishes were ever foolso come come come
 they heave mark antony aloft to cleopatra
 and welcome welcome die where thou hast lived
 quicken with kissing had my lips that power
 thus would i wear them out
all a heavy sight
mark antony i am dying egypt dying
 give me some wine and let me speak a little
cleopatra no let me speak and let me rail so high
 that the false housewife fortune break her wheel
 provoked by my offence
mark antony one word sweet queen
 of caesar seek your honour with your safety o
cleopatra they do not go together
mark antony gentle hear me
 none about caesar trust but proculeius
cleopatra my resolution and my hands i'll trust
 none about caesar
mark antony the miserable change now at my end
 lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts
 in feeding them with those my former fortunes
 wherein i lived the greatest prince o the world
 the noblest and do now not basely die
 not cowardly put off my helmet to
 my countrymana roman by a roman
 valiantly vanquish'd now my spirit is going
 i can no more
cleopatra noblest of men woo't die
 hast thou no care of me shall i abide
 in this dull world which in thy absence is
 no better than a sty o see my women
 mark antony dies
 the crown o the earth doth melt my lord
 o wither'd is the garland of the war
 the soldier's pole is fall'n young boys and girls
 are level now with men the odds is gone
 and there is nothing left remarkable
 beneath the visiting moon

charmian o quietness lady

charmian lady
iras madam
charmian o madam madam madam
iras royal egypt empress
charmian peace peace iras
cleopatra no more but e'en a woman and commanded
 by such poor passion as the maid that milks
 and does the meanest chares it were for me
 to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
 to tell them that this world did equal theirs
 till they had stol'n our jewel all's but naught
 patience is scottish and impatience does
 become a dog that's mad then is it sin
 to rush into the secret house of death
 ere death dare come to us how do you women
 what what good cheer why how now charmian
 my noble girls ah women women look
 our lamp is spent it's out good sirs take heart
 we'll bury him and then what's brave
 what's noble
 let's do it after the high roman fashion
 and make death proud to take us come away
 this case of that huge spirit now is cold
 ah women women come we have no friend
 but resolution and the briefest end
 exeunt those above bearing off mark antony's body

scene i alexandria octavius caesar's camp
 enter octavius caesar agrippa dolabella mecaenas
 gallus proculeius and others his council of war
octavius caesar go to him dolabella bid him yield
 being so frustrate tell him he mocks
 the pauses that he makes
dolabella caesar i shall
 exit
 enter dercetas with the sword of mark antony
octavius caesar wherefore is that and what art thou that darest
 appear thus to us
dercetas i am call'd dercetas
 mark antony i served who best was worthy
 best to be served whilst he stood up and spoke
 he was my master and i wore my life
 to spend upon his haters if thou please
 to take me to thee as i was to him
 i'll be to caesar if thou pleasest not
 i yield thee up my life
octavius caesar what is't thou say'st
dercetas i say o caesar antony is dead
octavius caesar the breaking of so great a thing should make
 a greater crack the round world
 should have shook lions into civil streets
 and citizens to their dens the death of antony
 is not a single doom in the name lay
 a moiety of the world
dercetas he is dead caesar
 not by a public minister of justice
 nor by a hired knife but that self hand
 which writ his honour in the acts it did
 hath with the courage which the heart did lend it
 splitted the heart this is his sword
 i robb'd his wound of it behold it stain'd
 with his most noble blood
octavius caesar look you sad friends
 the gods rebuke me but it is tidings
 to wash the eyes of kings
agrippa and strange it is
 that nature must compel us to lament
 our most persisted deeds
mecaenas his taints and honours
 waged equal with him
agrippa a rarer spirit never
 did steer humanity but you gods will give us
 some faults to make us men caesar is touch'd
mecaenas when such a spacious mirror's set before him
 he needs must see himself
octavius caesar o antony
 i have follow'd thee to this but we do lance
 diseases in our bodies i must perforce
 have shown to thee such a declining day
 or look on thine we could not stall together
 in the whole world but yet let me lament
 with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
 that thou my brother my competitor
 in top of all design my mate in empire
 friend and companion in the front of war
 the arm of mine own body and the heart
 where mine his thoughts did kindlethat our stars
 unreconciliable should divide
 our equalness to this hear me good friends
 but i will tell you at some meeter season
 enter an egyptian
 the business of this man looks out of him
 we'll hear him what he says whence are you
egyptian a poor egyptian yet the queen my mistress
 confined in all she has her monument
 of thy intents desires instruction
 that she preparedly may frame herself
 to the way she's forced to
octavius caesar bid her have good heart
 she soon shall know of us by some of ours
 how honourable and how kindly we
 determine for her for caesar cannot live
 to be ungentle
egyptian so the gods preserve thee
 exit
octavius caesar come hither proculeius go and say
 we purpose her no shame give her what comforts
 the quality of her passion shall require
 lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke
 she do defeat us for her life in rome
 would be eternal in our triumph go
 and with your speediest bring us what she says
 and how you find of her
proculeius caesar i shall
 exit
octavius caesar gallus go you along
 exit gallus

octavius caesar let him alone for i remember now
 how he's employ'd he shall in time be ready
 go with me to my tent where you shall see
 how hardly i was drawn into this war
 how calm and gentle i proceeded still
 in all my writings go with me and see
 what i can show in this
 exeunt

act v
scene ii alexandria a room in the monument
 enter cleopatra charmian and iras
cleopatra my desolation does begin to make
 a better life tis paltry to be caesar
 not being fortune he's but fortune's knave
 a minister of her will and it is great
 to do that thing that ends all other deeds
 which shackles accidents and bolts up change
 which sleeps and never palates more the dug
 the beggar's nurse and caesar's
 enter to the gates of the monument proculeius
 gallus and soldiers
proculeius caesar sends greeting to the queen of egypt
 and bids thee study on what fair demands
 thou mean'st to have him grant thee
cleopatra what's thy name
proculeius my name is proculeius
cleopatra antony
 did tell me of you bade me trust you but
 i do not greatly care to be deceived
 that have no use for trusting if your master
 would have a queen his beggar you must tell him
 that majesty to keep decorum must
 no less beg than a kingdom if he please
 to give me conquer'd egypt for my son
 he gives me so much of mine own as i
 will kneel to him with thanks
proculeius be of good cheer
 you're fall'n into a princely hand fear nothing
 make your full reference freely to my lord
 who is so full of grace that it flows over
 on all that need let me report to him
 your sweet dependency and you shall find
 a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
 where he for grace is kneel'd to
cleopatra pray you tell him
 i am his fortune's vassal and i send him
 the greatness he has got i hourly learn
 a doctrine of obedience and would gladly
 look him i the face
proculeius this i'll report dear lady
 have comfort for i know your plight is pitied
 of him that caused it
gallus you see how easily she may be surprised
 here proculeius and two of the guard ascend the
 monument by a ladder placed against a window and
 having descended come behind cleopatra some of
 the guard unbar and open the gates
 to proculeius and the guard
 guard her till caesar come
 exit
iras royal queen

 relieved but not betray'd
cleopatra what of death too

 the undoing of yourself let the world see
 his nobleness well acted which your death
 will never let come forth
cleopatra where art thou death
 come hither come come come and take a queen
 worthy many babes and beggars
proculeius o temperance lady
cleopatra sir i will eat no meat i'll not drink sir
 if idle talk will once be necessary
 i'll not sleep neither this mortal house i'll ruin
 do caesar what he can know sir that i
 will not wait pinion'd at your master's court
 nor once be chastised with the sober eye
 of dull octavia shall they hoist me up
 and show me to the shouting varletry
 of censuring rome rather a ditch in egypt
 be gentle grave unto me rather on nilus mud
 lay me stark naked and let the waterflies
 blow me into abhorring rather make
 my country's high pyramides my gibbet
 and hang me up in chains
proculeius you do extend
 these thoughts of horror further than you shall
 find cause in caesar
 enter dolabella
dolabella proculeius
 what thou hast done thy master caesar knows
 and he hath sent for thee for the queen
 i'll take her to my guard
proculeius so dolabella
 it shall content me best be gentle to her
 to cleopatra
 to caesar i will speak what you shall please
 if you'll employ me to him
cleopatra say i would die
 exeunt proculeius and soldiers
dolabella most noble empress you have heard of me
cleopatra i cannot tell
dolabella assuredly you know me
cleopatra no matter sir what i have heard or known
 you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
 is't not your trick
dolabella i understand not madam
cleopatra i dream'd there was an emperor antony
 o such another sleep that i might see
 but such another man
dolabella if it might please ye
cleopatra his face was as the heavens and therein stuck
 a sun and moon which kept their course
 and lighted
 the little o the earth
dolabella most sovereign creature
cleopatra his legs bestrid the ocean his rear'd arm
 crested the world his voice was propertied
 as all the tuned spheres and that to friends
 but when he meant to quail and shake the orb
 he was as rattling thunder for his bounty
 there was no winter in't an autumn twas
 that grew the more by reaping his delights
 were dolphinlike they show'd his back above
 the element they lived in in his livery
 walk'd crowns and crownets realms and islands were
 as plates dropp'd from his pocket
dolabella cleopatra
cleopatra think you there was or might be such a man
 as this i dream'd of
dolabella gentle madam no
cleopatra you lie up to the hearing of the gods
 but if there be or ever were one such
 it's past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff
 to vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine
 and antony were nature's piece gainst fancy
 condemning shadows quite
dolabella hear me good madam
 your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
 as answering to the weight would i might never
 o'ertake pursued success but i do feel
 by the rebound of yours a grief that smites
 my very heart at root
cleopatra i thank you sir
 know you what caesar means to do with me
dolabella i am loath to tell you what i would you knew
cleopatra nay pray you sir
dolabella though he be honourable
cleopatra he'll lead me then in triumph
dolabella madam he will i know't
 flourish and shout within make way there

dolabella it is the emperor madam
 cleopatra kneels
octavius caesar arise you shall not kneel
 i pray you rise rise egypt
cleopatra sir the gods
 will have it thus my master and my lord
 i must obey
octavius caesar take to you no hard thoughts
 the record of what injuries you did us
 though written in our flesh we shall remember
 as things but done by chance
cleopatra sole sir o the world
 i cannot project mine own cause so well
 to make it clear but do confess i have
 been laden with like frailties which before
 have often shamed our sex
octavius caesar cleopatra know
 we will extenuate rather than enforce
 if you apply yourself to our intents
 which towards you are most gentle you shall find
 a benefit in this change but if you seek
 to lay on me a cruelty by taking
 antony's course you shall bereave yourself
 of my good purposes and put your children
 to that destruction which i'll guard them from
 if thereon you rely i'll take my leave
cleopatra and may through all the world tis yours and we
 your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall
 hang in what place you please here my good lord
octavius caesar you shall advise me in all for cleopatra
cleopatra this is the brief of money plate and jewels
 i am possess'd of tis exactly valued
 not petty things admitted where's seleucus
seleucus here madam
cleopatra this is my treasurer let him speak my lord
 upon his peril that i have reserved
 to myself nothing speak the truth seleucus
seleucus madam
 i had rather seal my lips than to my peril
 speak that which is not
cleopatra what have i kept back
seleucus enough to purchase what you have made known
octavius caesar nay blush not cleopatra i approve
 your wisdom in the deed
cleopatra see caesar o behold
 how pomp is follow'd mine will now be yours
 and should we shift estates yours would be mine
 the ingratitude of this seleucus does
 even make me wild o slave of no more trust
 than love that's hired what goest thou back thou shalt
 go back i warrant thee but i'll catch thine eyes
 though they had wings slave soulless villain dog
 o rarely base
octavius caesar good queen let us entreat you
cleopatra o caesar what a wounding shame is this
 that thou vouchsafing here to visit me
 doing the honour of thy lordliness
 to one so meek that mine own servant should
 parcel the sum of my disgraces by
 addition of his envy say good caesar
 that i some lady trifles have reserved
 immoment toys things of such dignity
 as we greet modern friends withal and say
 some nobler token i have kept apart
 for livia and octavia to induce
 their mediation must i be unfolded
 with one that i have bred the gods it smites me
 beneath the fall i have
 to seleucus
 prithee go hence
 or i shall show the cinders of my spirits
 through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man
 thou wouldst have mercy on me
octavius caesar forbear seleucus
 exit seleucus
cleopatra be it known that we the greatest are misthought
 for things that others do and when we fall
 we answer others merits in our name
 are therefore to be pitied
octavius caesar cleopatra
 not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged
 put we i the roll of conquest still be't yours
 bestow it at your pleasure and believe
 caesar's no merchant to make prize with you
 of things that merchants sold therefore be cheer'd
 make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen
 for we intend so to dispose you as
 yourself shall give us counsel feed and sleep
 our care and pity is so much upon you
 that we remain your friend and so adieu
cleopatra my master and my lord
octavius caesar not so adieu

 rank of gross diet shall be enclouded
 and forced to drink their vapour
iras the gods forbid
cleopatra nay tis most certain iras saucy lictors
 will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers
 ballad us out o tune the quick comedians
 extemporally will stage us and present
 our alexandrian revels antony
 shall be brought drunken forth and i shall see
 some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness
 i the posture of a whore
iras o the good gods
cleopatra nay that's certain
iras i'll never see t for i am sure my nails
 are stronger than mine eyes
cleopatra why that's the way
 to fool their preparation and to conquer
 their most absurd intents
 reenter charmian
 now charmian
 show me my women like a queen go fetch
 my best attires i am again for cydnus
 to meet mark antony sirrah iras go

 exit iras a noise within
 enter a guardsman
guard here is a rural fellow
 that will not be denied your highness presence
 he brings you figs
cleopatra let him come in
 exit guardsman
 what poor an instrument
 may do a noble deed he brings me liberty
 my resolution's placed and i have nothing
 of woman in me now from head to foot
 i am marbleconstant now the fleeting moon
 no planet is of mine
 reenter guardsman with clown bringing in a basket
guard this is the man
cleopatra avoid and leave him
 exit guardsman
 hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there
 that kills and pains not
clown truly i have him but i would not be the party
 that should desire you to touch him for his biting
 is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or
 never recover
cleopatra rememberest thou any that have died on't
clown very many men and women too i heard of one of
 them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman
 but something given to lie as a woman should not
 do but in the way of honesty how she died of the
 biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes
 a very good report o the worm but he that will
 believe all that they say shall never be saved by
 half that they do but this is most fallible the
 worm's an odd worm
cleopatra get thee hence farewell
clown i wish you all joy of the worm
 setting down his basket
cleopatra farewell
clown you must think this look you that the worm will
 do his kind
cleopatra ay ay farewell
clown look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the
 keeping of wise people for indeed there is no
 goodness in worm
cleopatra take thou no care it shall be heeded
clown very good give it nothing i pray you for it is
 not worth the feeding
cleopatra will it eat me
clown you must not think i am so simple but i know the
 devil himself will not eat a woman i know that a
 woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her
 not but truly these same whoreson devils do the
 gods great harm in their women for in every ten
 that they make the devils mar five
cleopatra well get thee gone farewell
clown yes forsooth i wish you joy o the worm
 exit
 reenter iras with a robe crown &c
cleopatra give me my robe put on my crown i have
 immortal longings in me now no more
 the juice of egypt's grape shall moist this lip
 yare yare good iras quick methinks i hear
 antony call i see him rouse himself
 to praise my noble act i hear him mock
 the luck of caesar which the gods give men
 to excuse their after wrath husband i come
 now to that name my courage prove my title
 i am fire and air my other elements
 i give to baser life so have you done
 come then and take the last warmth of my lips
 farewell kind charmian iras long farewell
 kisses them iras falls and dies
 have i the aspic in my lips dost fall
 if thou and nature can so gently part
 the stroke of death is as a lover's pinch
 which hurts and is desired dost thou lie still
 if thus thou vanishest thou tell'st the world
 it is not worth leavetaking
charmian dissolve thick cloud and rain that i may say
 the gods themselves do weep
cleopatra this proves me base
 if she first meet the curled antony
 he'll make demand of her and spend that kiss
 which is my heaven to have come thou
 mortal wretch
 to an asp which she applies to her breast
 with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
 of life at once untie poor venomous fool
 be angry and dispatch o couldst thou speak
 that i might hear thee call great caesar ass
 unpolicied
charmian o eastern star
cleopatra peace peace
 dost thou not see my baby at my breast
 that sucks the nurse asleep
charmian o break o break
cleopatra as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle
 o antonynay i will take thee too
 applying another asp to her arm
 what should i stay
 dies
charmian in this vile world so fare thee well
 now boast thee death in thy possession lies
 a lass unparallel'd downy windows close
 and golden phoebus never be beheld
 of eyes again so royal your crown's awry
 i'll mend it and then play
 enter the guard rushing in
first guard where is the queen
charmian speak softly wake her not
first guard caesar hath sent
charmian too slow a messenger
 applies an asp
 o come apace dispatch i partly feel thee
first guard approach ho all's not well caesar's beguiled
second guard there's dolabella sent from caesar call him
first guard what work is here charmian is this well done
charmian it is well done and fitting for a princess
 descended of so many royal kings
 ah soldier
 dies
 reenter dolabella
dolabella how goes it here
second guard all dead
dolabella caesar thy thoughts
 touch their effects in this thyself art coming
 to see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
 so sought'st to hinder
 within a way there a way for caesar'
 reenter octavius caesar and all his train marching
dolabella o sir you are too sure an augurer
 that you did fear is done
octavius caesar bravest at the last
 she levell'd at our purposes and being royal
 took her own way the manner of their deaths
 i do not see them bleed
dolabella who was last with them
first guard a simple countryman that brought her figs
 this was his basket
octavius caesar poison'd then
first guard o caesar
 this charmian lived but now she stood and spake
 i found her trimming up the diadem
 on her dead mistress tremblingly she stood
 and on the sudden dropp'd
octavius caesar o noble weakness
 if they had swallow'd poison twould appear
 by external swelling but she looks like sleep
 as she would catch another antony
 in her strong toil of grace
dolabella here on her breast
 there is a vent of blood and something blown
 the like is on her arm
first guard this is an aspic's trail and these figleaves
 have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves
 upon the caves of nile
octavius caesar most probable
 that so she died for her physician tells me
 she hath pursued conclusions infinite
 of easy ways to die take up her bed
 and bear her women from the monument
 she shall be buried by her antony
 no grave upon the earth shall clip in it
 a pair so famous high events as these
 strike those that make them and their story is
 no less in pity than his glory which
 brought them to be lamented our army shall
 in solemn show attend this funeral
 and then to rome come dolabella see
 high order in this great solemnity

act i
scene i rome a street
 enter a company of mutinous citizens with staves
 clubs and other weapons
first citizen before we proceed any further hear me speak
all speak speak
first citizen you are all resolved rather to die than to famish
all resolved resolved
first citizen first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people
all we know't we know't
first citizen let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own price
 is't a verdict
all no more talking on't let it be done away away
second citizen one word good citizens
first citizen we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
 what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they
 would yield us but the superfluity while it were
 wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely
 but they think we are too dear the leanness that
 afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
 inventory to particularise their abundance our
 sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with
 our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i
 speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge
second citizen would you proceed especially against caius marcius
all against him first he's a very dog to the commonalty
second citizen consider you what services he has done for his country
first citizen very well and could be content to give him good
 report fort but that he pays himself with being proud
second citizen nay but speak not maliciously
first citizen i say unto you what he hath done famously he did
 it to that end though softconscienced men can be
 content to say it was for his country he did it to
 please his mother and to be partly proud which he
 is even till the altitude of his virtue
second citizen what he cannot help in his nature you account a
 vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous
first citizen if i must not i need not be barren of accusations
 he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition
 shouts within
 what shouts are these the other side o the city
 is risen why stay we prating here to the capitol
all come come
first citizen soft who comes here
 enter menenius agrippa
second citizen worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always loved
 the people
first citizen he's one honest enough would all the rest were so
menenius what work's my countrymen in hand where go you
 with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you
first citizen our business is not unknown to the senate they have
 had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do
 which now we'll show em in deeds they say poor
 suitors have strong breaths they shall know we
 have strong arms too
menenius why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
 will you undo yourselves
first citizen we cannot sir we are undone already
menenius i tell you friends most charitable care
 have the patricians of you for your wants
 your suffering in this dearth you may as well
 strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
 against the roman state whose course will on
 the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
 of more strong link asunder than can ever
 appear in your impediment for the dearth
 the gods not the patricians make it and
 your knees to them not arms must help alack
 you are transported by calamity
 thither where more attends you and you slander
 the helms o the state who care for you like fathers
 when you curse them as enemies
first citizen care for us true indeed they ne'er cared for us
 yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses
 crammed with grain make edicts for usury to
 support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act
 established against the rich and provide more
 piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain
 the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and
 there's all the love they bear us
menenius either you must
 confess yourselves wondrous malicious
 or be accused of folly i shall tell you
 a pretty tale it may be you have heard it
 but since it serves my purpose i will venture
 to stale t a little more
first citizen well i'll hear it sir yet you must not think to
 fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please
 you deliver
menenius there was a time when all the body's members
 rebell'd against the belly thus accused it
 that only like a gulf it did remain
 i the midst o the body idle and unactive
 still cupboarding the viand never bearing
 like labour with the rest where the other instruments
 did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
 and mutually participate did minister
 unto the appetite and affection common
 of the whole body the belly answer'd
first citizen well sir what answer made the belly
menenius sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile
 which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus
 for look you i may make the belly smile
 as well as speakit tauntingly replied
 to the discontented members the mutinous parts
 that envied his receipt even so most fitly
 as you malign our senators for that
 they are not such as you
first citizen your belly's answer what
 the kinglycrowned head the vigilant eye
 the counsellor heart the arm our soldier
 our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
 with other muniments and petty helps
 in this our fabric if that they
menenius what then
 fore me this fellow speaks what then what then
first citizen should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd
 who is the sink o the body
menenius well what then
first citizen the former agents if they did complain
 what could the belly answer
menenius i will tell you
 if you'll bestow a smallof what you have little
 patience awhile you'll hear the belly's answer
first citizen ye're long about it
menenius note me this good friend
 your most grave belly was deliberate
 not rash like his accusers and thus answer'd
 true is it my incorporate friends quoth he
 that i receive the general food at first
 which you do live upon and fit it is
 because i am the storehouse and the shop
 of the whole body but if you do remember
 i send it through the rivers of your blood
 even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain
 and through the cranks and offices of man
 the strongest nerves and small inferior veins
 from me receive that natural competency
 whereby they live and though that all at once
 you my good friends'this says the belly mark me
first citizen ay sir well well
menenius though all at once cannot
 see what i do deliver out to each
 yet i can make my audit up that all
 from me do back receive the flour of all
 and leave me but the bran what say you to't
first citizen it was an answer how apply you this
menenius the senators of rome are this good belly
 and you the mutinous members for examine
 their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
 touching the weal o the common you shall find
 no public benefit which you receive
 but it proceeds or comes from them to you
 and no way from yourselves what do you think
 you the great toe of this assembly
first citizen i the great toe why the great toe
menenius for that being one o the lowest basest poorest
 of this most wise rebellion thou go'st foremost
 thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
 lead'st first to win some vantage
 but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
 rome and her rats are at the point of battle
 the one side must have bale
 enter caius marcius
 hail noble marcius
marcius thanks what's the matter you dissentious rogues
 that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
 make yourselves scabs
first citizen we have ever your good word
marcius he that will give good words to thee will flatter
 beneath abhorring what would you have you curs
 that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you
 the other makes you proud he that trusts to you
 where he should find you lions finds you hares
 where foxes geese you are no surer no
 than is the coal of fire upon the ice
 or hailstone in the sun your virtue is
 to make him worthy whose offence subdues him
 and curse that justice did it
 who deserves greatness
 deserves your hate and your affections are
 a sick man's appetite who desires most that
 which would increase his evil he that depends
 upon your favours swims with fins of lead
 and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye
 with every minute you do change a mind
 and call him noble that was now your hate
 him vile that was your garland what's the matter
 that in these several places of the city
 you cry against the noble senate who
 under the gods keep you in awe which else
 would feed on one another what's their seeking
menenius for corn at their own rates whereof they say
 the city is well stored
marcius hang em they say
 they'll sit by the fire and presume to know
 what's done i the capitol who's like to rise
 who thrives and who declines side factions
 and give out
 conjectural marriages making parties strong
 and feebling such as stand not in their liking
 below their cobbled shoes they say there's
 grain enough
 would the nobility lay aside their ruth
 and let me use my sword i'll make a quarry
 with thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high
 as i could pick my lance
menenius nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
 for though abundantly they lack discretion
 yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you
 what says the other troop
marcius they are dissolved hang em
 they said they were anhungry sigh'd forth proverbs
 that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
 that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
 corn for the rich men only with these shreds
 they vented their complainings which being answer'd
 and a petition granted them a strange one
 to break the heart of generosity
 and make bold power look palethey threw their caps
 as they would hang them on the horns o the moon
 shouting their emulation
menenius what is granted them
marcius five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
 of their own choice one's junius brutus
 sicinius velutus and i know not'sdeath
 the rabble should have first unroof'd the city
 ere so prevail'd with me it will in time
 win upon power and throw forth greater themes
 for insurrection's arguing
menenius this is strange
marcius go get you home you fragments
 enter a messenger hastily
messenger where's caius marcius
marcius here what's the matter
messenger the news is sir the volsces are in arms
marcius i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent
 our musty superfluity see our best elders
 enter cominius titus lartius and other senators
 junius brutus and sicinius velutus
first senator marcius tis true that you have lately told us
 the volsces are in arms
marcius they have a leader
 tullus aufidius that will put you to t
 i sin in envying his nobility
 and were i any thing but what i am
 i would wish me only he
cominius you have fought together
marcius were half to half the world by the ears and he
 upon my party i'ld revolt to make
 only my wars with him he is a lion
 that i am proud to hunt
first senator then worthy marcius
 attend upon cominius to these wars
cominius it is your former promise
marcius sir it is
 and i am constant titus lartius thou
 shalt see me once more strike at tullus face
 what art thou stiff stand'st out
titus no caius marcius
 i'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
 ere stay behind this business
menenius o truebred
first senator your company to the capitol where i know
 our greatest friends attend us
titus to cominius lead you on
 to marcius follow cominius we must follow you
 right worthy you priority
cominius noble marcius
first senator to the citizens hence to your homes be gone
marcius nay let them follow
 the volsces have much corn take these rats thither
 to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners
 your valour puts well forth pray follow
 citizens steal away exeunt all but sicinius
 and brutus
sicinius was ever man so proud as is this marcius
brutus he has no equal
sicinius when we were chosen tribunes for the people
brutus mark'd you his lip and eyes
sicinius nay but his taunts
brutus being moved he will not spare to gird the gods
sicinius bemock the modest moon
brutus the present wars devour him he is grown
 too proud to be so valiant
sicinius such a nature
 tickled with good success disdains the shadow
 which he treads on at noon but i do wonder
 his insolence can brook to be commanded
 under cominius
brutus fame at the which he aims
 in whom already he's well graced can not
 better be held nor more attain'd than by
 a place below the first for what miscarries
 shall be the general's fault though he perform
 to the utmost of a man and giddy censure
 will then cry out of marcius o if he
 had borne the business'
sicinius besides if things go well
 opinion that so sticks on marcius shall
 of his demerits rob cominius
brutus come
 half all cominius honours are to marcius
 though marcius earned them not and all his faults
 to marcius shall be honours though indeed
 in aught he merit not
sicinius let's hence and hear
 how the dispatch is made and in what fashion
 more than his singularity he goes
 upon this present action

 what ever have been thought on in this state
 that could be brought to bodily act ere rome
 had circumvention tis not four days gone
 since i heard thence these are the words i think
 i have the letter here yes here it is
 reads
 they have press'd a power but it is not known
 whether for east or west the dearth is great
 the people mutinous and it is rumour'd
 cominius marcius your old enemy
 who is of rome worse hated than of you
 and titus lartius a most valiant roman
 these three lead on this preparation
 whither tis bent most likely tis for you
 consider of it'
first senator our army's in the field
 we never yet made doubt but rome was ready
 to answer us
aufidius nor did you think it folly
 to keep your great pretences veil'd till when
 they needs must show themselves which
 in the hatching
 it seem'd appear'd to rome by the discovery
 we shall be shorten'd in our aim which was
 to take in many towns ere almost rome
 should know we were afoot
second senator noble aufidius
 take your commission hie you to your bands
 let us alone to guard corioli
 if they set down before s for the remove
 bring your army but i think you'll find
 they've not prepared for us
aufidius o doubt not that
 i speak from certainties nay more
 some parcels of their power are forth already
 and only hitherward i leave your honours
 if we and caius marcius chance to meet
 tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
 till one can do no more

 on two low stools and sew
volumnia i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a
 more comfortable sort if my son were my husband i
 should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
 won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
 he would show most love when yet he was but
 tenderbodied and the only son of my womb when
 youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when
 for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not
 sell him an hour from her beholding i considering
 how honour would become such a person that it was
 no better than picturelike to hang by the wall if
 renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek
 danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel
 war i sent him from whence he returned his brows
 bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not
 more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild
 than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
 man
virgilia but had he died in the business madam how then
volumnia then his good report should have been my son i
 therein would have found issue hear me profess

 marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their
 country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action
 enter a gentlewoman
gentlewoman madam the lady valeria is come to visit you
virgilia beseech you give me leave to retire myself
volumnia indeed you shall not
 methinks i hear hither your husband's drum

 as children from a bear the volsces shunning him
 methinks i see him stamp thus and call thus
 come on you cowards you were got in fear
 though you were born in rome his bloody brow
 with his mail'd hand then wiping forth he goes
 like to a harvestman that's task'd to mow
 or all or lose his hire
virgilia his bloody brow o jupiter no blood
volumnia away you fool it more becomes a man
 than gilt his trophy the breasts of hecuba
 when she did suckle hector look'd not lovelier
 than hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
 at grecian sword contemning tell valeria
 we are fit to bid her welcome
 exit gentlewoman
virgilia heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius
volumnia he'll beat aufidius head below his knee

 faith how does your little son

 look upon his schoolmaster
valeria o my word the father's son i'll swear'tis a
 very pretty boy o my troth i looked upon him o'
 wednesday half an hour together has such a
 confirmed countenance i saw him run after a gilded
 butterfly and when he caught it he let it go
 again and after it again and over and over he
 comes and again catched it again or whether his
 fall enraged him or how twas he did so set his
 teeth and tear it o i warrant it how he mammocked
 it

 tutus aufidius is he within your walls
first senator no nor a man that fears you less than he
 that's lesser than a little
 drums afar off
 hark our drums

 rather than they shall pound us up our gates
 which yet seem shut we have but pinn'd with rushes
 they'll open of themselves
 alarum afar off

 amongst your cloven army
marcius o they are at it

marcius they fear us not but issue forth their city
 now put your shields before your hearts and fight
 with hearts more proof than shields advance
 brave titus
 they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
 which makes me sweat with wrath come on my fellows
 he that retires i'll take him for a volsce
 and he shall feel mine edge
 alarum the romans are beat back to their
 trenches reenter marcius cursing

 clapp'd to their gates he is himself alone

lartius o noble fellow
 who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
 and when it bows stands up thou art left marcius
 a carbuncle entire as big as thou art
 were not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldier
 even to cato's wish not fierce and terrible
 only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
 the thunderlike percussion of thy sounds
 thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world

 bury with those that wore them these base slaves
 ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them
 and hark what noise the general makes to him
 there is the man of my soul's hate aufidius
 piercing our romans then valiant titus take
 convenient numbers to make good the city
 whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste
 to help cominius
lartius worthy sir thou bleed'st
 thy exercise hath been too violent for
 a second course of fight
marcius sir praise me not
 my work hath yet not warm'd me fare you well
 the blood i drop is rather physical
 than dangerous to me to aufidius thus
 i will appear and fight

 fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
 misguide thy opposers swords bold gentleman
 prosperity be thy page

 enter a messenger
 thy news
messenger the citizens of corioli have issued
 and given to lartius and to marcius battle
 i saw our party to their trenches driven
 and then i came away
cominius though thou speak'st truth
 methinks thou speak'st not well
 how long is't since
messenger above an hour my lord
cominius tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums
 how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
 and bring thy news so late
messenger spies of the volsces
 held me in chase that i was forced to wheel
 three or four miles about else had i sir
 half an hour since brought my report
cominius who's yonder
 that does appear as he were flay'd o gods
 he has the stamp of marcius and i have
 beforetime seen him thus
marcius within come i too late
cominius the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
 more than i know the sound of marcius tongue
 from every meaner man
 enter marcius
marcius come i too late
cominius ay if you come not in the blood of others
 but mantled in your own
marcius o let me clip ye
 in arms as sound as when i woo'd in heart
 as merry as when our nuptial day was done
 and tapers burn'd to bedward
cominius flower of warriors
 how is it with titus lartius
marcius as with a man busied about decrees
 condemning some to death and some to exile
 ransoming him or pitying threatening the other
 holding corioli in the name of rome
 even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
 to let him slip at will
cominius where is that slave
 which told me they had beat you to your trenches
 where is he call him hither
marcius let him alone
 he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen
 the common filea plague tribunes for them
 the mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
 from rascals worse than they
cominius but how prevail'd you
marcius will the time serve to tell i do not think
 where is the enemy are you lords o the field
 if not why cease you till you are so
cominius marcius
 we have at disadvantage fought and did
 retire to win our purpose
marcius how lies their battle know you on which side
 they have placed their men of trust
cominius as i guess marcius
 their bands i the vaward are the antiates
 of their best trust o'er them aufidius
 their very heart of hope
marcius i do beseech you
 by all the battles wherein we have fought
 by the blood we have shed together by the vows
 we have made to endure friends that you directly
 set me against aufidius and his antiates
 and that you not delay the present but
 filling the air with swords advanced and darts
 we prove this very hour
cominius though i could wish
 you were conducted to a gentle bath
 and balms applied to you yet dare i never
 deny your asking take your choice of those
 that best can aid your action
marcius those are they
 that most are willing if any such be here
 as it were sin to doubtthat love this painting
 wherein you see me smear'd if any fear
 lesser his person than an ill report
 if any think brave death outweighs bad life
 and that his country's dearer than himself
 let him alone or so many so minded
 wave thus to express his disposition
 and follow marcius
 they all shout and wave their swords take him up in
 their arms and cast up their caps
 o me alone make you a sword of me
 if these shows be not outward which of you
 but is four volsces none of you but is
 able to bear against the great aufidius
 a shield as hard as his a certain number
 though thanks to all must i select
 from all the rest
 shall bear the business in some other fight
 as cause will be obey'd please you to march
 and four shall quickly draw out my command
 which men are best inclined

 who has a charter to extol her blood
 when she does praise me grieves me i have done
 as you have done that's what i can induced
 as you have been that's for my country
 he that has but effected his good will
 hath overta'en mine act
cominius you shall not be
 the grave of your deserving rome must know
 the value of her own twere a concealment
 worse than a theft no less than a traducement
 to hide your doings and to silence that
 which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd
 would seem but modest therefore i beseech you
 in sign of what you are not to reward
 what you have donebefore our army hear me
marcius i have some wounds upon me and they smart
 to hear themselves remember'd
cominius should they not
 well might they fester gainst ingratitude
 and tent themselves with death of all the horses
 whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all
 the treasure in this field achieved and city
 we render you the tenth to be ta'en forth
 before the common distribution at
 your only choice
marcius i thank you general
 but cannot make my heart consent to take
 a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it
 and stand upon my common part with those
 that have beheld the doing
 a long flourish they all cry marcius marcius'
 cast up their caps and lances cominius and lartius
 stand bare
marcius may these same instruments which you profane
 never sound more when drums and trumpets shall
 i the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
 made all of falsefaced soothing
 when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk
 let him be made a coverture for the wars
 no more i say for that i have not wash'd
 my nose that bled or foil'd some debile wretch
 which without note here's many else have done
 you shout me forth
 in acclamations hyperbolical
 as if i loved my little should be dieted
 in praises sauced with lies
cominius too modest are you
 more cruel to your good report than grateful
 to us that give you truly by your patience
 if gainst yourself you be incensed we'll put you
 like one that means his proper harm in manacles
 then reason safely with you therefore be it known
 as to us to all the world that caius marcius
 wears this war's garland in token of the which
 my noble steed known to the camp i give him
 with all his trim belonging and from this time
 for what he did before corioli call him
 with all the applause and clamour of the host
 caius marcius coriolanus bear
 the addition nobly ever
 flourish trumpets sound and drums
all caius marcius coriolanus
coriolanus i will go wash
 and when my face is fair you shall perceive
 whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you
 i mean to stride your steed and at all times
 to undercrest your good addition
 to the fairness of my power
cominius so to our tent
 where ere we do repose us we will write
 to rome of our success you titus lartius
 must to corioli back send us to rome
 the best with whom we may articulate

 what good condition can a treaty find

 i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me
 and wouldst do so i think should we encounter
 as often as we eat by the elements
 if e'er again i meet him beard to beard

aufidius bolder though not so subtle my valour's poison'd
 with only suffering stain by him for him

act ii
scene i rome a public place
 enter menenius with the two tribunes of the people
 sicinius and brutus
menenius the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
brutus good or bad
menenius not according to the prayer of the people for they
 love not marcius
sicinius nature teaches beasts to know their friends
menenius pray you who does the wolf love
sicinius the lamb
menenius ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
 noble marcius
brutus he's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear
menenius he's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two
 are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you
both well sir
menenius in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two
 have not in abundance
brutus he's poor in no one fault but stored with all
sicinius especially in pride
brutus and topping all others in boasting
menenius this is strange now do you two know how you are
 censured here in the city i mean of us o the
 righthand file do you
both why how are we censured
menenius because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry
both well well sir well
menenius why tis no great matter for a very little thief of
 occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience
 give your dispositions the reins and be angry at
 your pleasures at the least if you take it as a
 pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for
 being proud
brutus we do it not alone sir
menenius i know you can do very little alone for your helps
 are many or else your actions would grow wondrous
 single your abilities are too infantlike for
 doing much alone you talk of pride o that you
 could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks
 and make but an interior survey of your good selves
 o that you could
brutus what then sir
menenius why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
 proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as
 any in rome
sicinius menenius you are known well enough too
menenius i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that
 loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
 tiber in't said to be something imperfect in
 favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike
 upon too trivial motion one that converses more
 with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
 of the morning what i think i utter and spend my
 malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as
 you arei cannot call you lycurgusesif the drink
 you give me touch my palate adversely i make a
 crooked face at it i can't say your worships have
 delivered the matter well when i find the ass in
 compound with the major part of your syllables and
 though i must be content to bear with those that say
 you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that
 tell you you have good faces if you see this in
 the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known
 well enough too what barm can your bisson
 conspectuities glean out of this character if i be
 known well enough too
brutus come sir come we know you well enough
menenius you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you
 are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you
 wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
 cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller
 and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
 second day of audience when you are hearing a
 matter between party and party if you chance to be
 pinched with the colic you make faces like
 mummers set up the bloody flag against all
 patience and in roaring for a chamberpot
 dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
 by your hearing all the peace you make in their
 cause is calling both the parties knaves you are
 a pair of strange ones
brutus come come you are well understood to be a
 perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
 bencher in the capitol
menenius our very priests must become mockers if they shall
 encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when
 you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the
 wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not
 so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
 cushion or to be entombed in an ass's pack
 saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud
 who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors
 since deucalion though peradventure some of the
 best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to
 your worships more of your conversation would
 infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
 plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you
 brutus and sicinius go aside
 enter volumnia virgilia and valeria
 how now my as fair as noble ladiesand the moon
 were she earthly no noblerwhither do you follow
 your eyes so fast
volumnia honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for
 the love of juno let's go

 approbation

 me
virgilia yes certain there's a letter for you i saw't
menenius a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven
 years health in which time i will make a lip at
 the physician the most sovereign prescription in
 galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative
 of no better report than a horsedrench is he
 not wounded he was wont to come home wounded
virgilia o no no no
volumnia o he is wounded i thank the gods for't
menenius so do i too if it be not too much brings a'
 victory in his pocket the wounds become him
volumnia on's brows menenius he comes the third time home
 with the oaken garland
menenius has he disciplined aufidius soundly
volumnia titus lartius writes they fought together but
 aufidius got off
menenius and twas time for him too i'll warrant him that
 an he had stayed by him i would not have been so
 fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold
 that's in them is the senate possessed of this
volumnia good ladies let's go yes yes yes the senate
 has letters from the general wherein he gives my
 son the whole name of the war he hath in this
 action outdone his former deeds doubly
valeria in troth there's wondrous things spoke of him
menenius wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his
 true purchasing
virgilia the gods grant them true
volumnia true pow wow
menenius true i'll be sworn they are true
 where is he wounded
 to the tribunes
 god save your good worships marcius is coming
 home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded
volumnia i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be
 large cicatrices to show the people when he shall
 stand for his place he received in the repulse of
 tarquin seven hurts i the body
menenius one i the neck and two i the thighthere's
 nine that i know
volumnia he had before this last expedition twentyfive
 wounds upon him
menenius now it's twentyseven every gash was an enemy's grave
 a shout and flourish
 hark the trumpets
volumnia these are the ushers of marcius before him he
 carries noise and behind him he leaves tears
 death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie
 which being advanced declines and then men die
 a sennet trumpets sound enter cominius the
 general and titus lartius between them coriolanus
 crowned with an oaken garland with captains and
 soldiers and a herald
herald know rome that all alone marcius did fight
 within corioli gates where he hath won
 with fame a name to caius marcius these
 in honour follows coriolanus
 welcome to rome renowned coriolanus
 flourish
all welcome to rome renowned coriolanus
coriolanus no more of this it does offend my heart
 pray now no more
cominius look sir your mother
coriolanus o
 you have i know petition'd all the gods
 for my prosperity
 kneels
volumnia nay my good soldier up
 my gentle marcius worthy caius and
 by deedachieving honour newly named
 what is itcoriolanus must i call thee
 but o thy wife
coriolanus my gracious silence hail
 wouldst thou have laugh'd had i come coffin'd home
 that weep'st to see me triumph ay my dear
 such eyes the widows in corioli wear
 and mothers that lack sons
menenius now the gods crown thee
coriolanus and live you yet
 to valeria
 o my sweet lady pardon
volumnia i know not where to turn o welcome home
 and welcome general and ye're welcome all
menenius a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep
 and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome
 a curse begin at very root on's heart
 that is not glad to see thee you are three
 that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men
 we have some old crabtrees here
 at home that will not
 be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors
 we call a nettle but a nettle and
 the faults of fools but folly
cominius ever right
coriolanus menenius ever ever
herald give way there and go on
coriolanus to volumnia and virgilia your hand and yours
 ere in our own house i do shade my head
 the good patricians must be visited
 from whom i have received not only greetings
 but with them change of honours
volumnia i have lived
 to see inherited my very wishes
 and the buildings of my fancy only
 there's one thing wanting which i doubt not but
 our rome will cast upon thee
coriolanus know good mother
 i had rather be their servant in my way
 than sway with them in theirs
cominius on to the capitol
 flourish cornets exeunt in state as before
 brutus and sicinius come forward
brutus all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
 are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse
 into a rapture lets her baby cry
 while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins
 her richest lockram bout her reechy neck
 clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows
 are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges horsed
 with variable complexions all agreeing
 in earnestness to see him seldshown flamens
 do press among the popular throngs and puff
 to win a vulgar station or veil'd dames
 commit the war of white and damask in
 their nicelygawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
 of phoebus burning kisses such a pother
 as if that whatsoever god who leads him
 were slily crept into his human powers
 and gave him graceful posture
sicinius on the sudden
 i warrant him consul
brutus then our office may
 during his power go sleep
sicinius he cannot temperately transport his honours
 from where he should begin and end but will
 lose those he hath won
brutus in that there's comfort
sicinius doubt not
 the commoners for whom we stand but they
 upon their ancient malice will forget
 with the least cause these his new honours which
 that he will give them make i as little question
 as he is proud to do't
brutus i heard him swear
 were he to stand for consul never would he
 appear i the marketplace nor on him put
 the napless vesture of humility
 nor showing as the manner is his wounds
 to the people beg their stinking breaths
sicinius tis right
brutus it was his word o he would miss it rather
 than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
 and the desire of the nobles
sicinius i wish no better
 than have him hold that purpose and to put it
 in execution
brutus tis most like he will
sicinius it shall be to him then as our good wills
 a sure destruction
brutus so it must fall out
 to him or our authorities for an end
 we must suggest the people in what hatred
 he still hath held them that to's power he would
 have made them mules silenced their pleaders and
 dispropertied their freedoms holding them
 in human action and capacity
 of no more soul nor fitness for the world
 than camels in the war who have their provand
 only for bearing burdens and sore blows
 for sinking under them
sicinius this as you say suggested
 at some time when his soaring insolence
 shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want
 if he be put upon t and that's as easy
 as to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire
 to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
 shall darken him for ever
 enter a messenger
brutus what's the matter
messenger you are sent for to the capitol tis thought
 that marcius shall be consul
 i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
 the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves
 ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
 upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended
 as to jove's statue and the commons made
 a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
 i never saw the like
brutus let's to the capitol
 and carry with us ears and eyes for the time
 but hearts for the event
sicinius have with you
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act ii
scene ii the same the capitol
 enter two officers to lay cushions
first officer come come they are almost here how many stand
 for consulships
second officer three they say but tis thought of every one
 coriolanus will carry it
first officer that's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and
 loves not the common people
second officer faith there had been many great men that have
 flattered the people who ne'er loved them and there
 be many that they have loved they know not
 wherefore so that if they love they know not why
 they hate upon no better a ground therefore for
 coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
 him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
 disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets
 them plainly see't
first officer if he did not care whether he had their love or no
 he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither
 good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater
 devotion than can render it him and leaves
 nothing undone that may fully discover him their
 opposite now to seem to affect the malice and
 displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
 dislikes to flatter them for their love
second officer he hath deserved worthily of his country and his
 ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who
 having been supple and courteous to the people
 bonneted without any further deed to have them at
 an into their estimation and report but he hath so
 planted his honours in their eyes and his actions
 in their hearts that for their tongues to be
 silent and not confess so much were a kind of
 ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a
 malice that giving itself the lie would pluck
 reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it
first officer no more of him he is a worthy man make way they
 are coming
 a sennet enter with actors before them cominius
 the consul menenius coriolanus senators
 sicinius and brutus the senators take their
 places the tribunes take their places by
 themselves coriolanus stands
menenius having determined of the volsces and
 to send for titus lartius it remains
 as the main point of this our aftermeeting
 to gratify his noble service that
 hath thus stood for his country therefore
 please you
 most reverend and grave elders to desire
 the present consul and last general
 in our wellfound successes to report
 a little of that worthy work perform'd
 by caius marcius coriolanus whom
 we met here both to thank and to remember
 with honours like himself
first senator speak good cominius
 leave nothing out for length and make us think
 rather our state's defective for requital
 than we to stretch it out
 to the tribunes
 masters o the people
 we do request your kindest ears and after
 your loving motion toward the common body
 to yield what passes here
sicinius we are convented
 upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
 inclinable to honour and advance
 the theme of our assembly
brutus which the rather
 we shall be blest to do if he remember
 a kinder value of the people than
 he hath hereto prized them at
menenius that's off that's off
 i would you rather had been silent please you
 to hear cominius speak
brutus most willingly
 but yet my caution was more pertinent
 than the rebuke you give it
menenius he loves your people
 but tie him not to be their bedfellow
 worthy cominius speak
 coriolanus offers to go away
 nay keep your place
first senator sit coriolanus never shame to hear
 what you have nobly done
coriolanus your horror's pardon
 i had rather have my wounds to heal again
 than hear say how i got them
brutus sir i hope
 my words disbench'd you not
coriolanus no sir yet oft
 when blows have made me stay i fled from words
 you soothed not therefore hurt not but
 your people
 i love them as they weigh
menenius pray now sit down
coriolanus i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun
 when the alarum were struck than idly sit
 to hear my nothings monster'd
 exit
menenius masters of the people
 your multiplying spawn how can he flatter
 that's thousand to one good onewhen you now see
 he had rather venture all his limbs for honour
 than one on's ears to hear it proceed cominius
cominius i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus
 should not be utter'd feebly it is held
 that valour is the chiefest virtue and
 most dignifies the haver if it be
 the man i speak of cannot in the world
 be singly counterpoised at sixteen years
 when tarquin made a head for rome he fought
 beyond the mark of others our then dictator
 whom with all praise i point at saw him fight
 when with his amazonian chin he drove
 the bristled lips before him be bestrid
 an o'erpress'd roman and i the consul's view
 slew three opposers tarquin's self he met
 and struck him on his knee in that day's feats
 when he might act the woman in the scene
 he proved best man i the field and for his meed
 was browbound with the oak his pupil age
 manenter'd thus he waxed like a sea
 and in the brunt of seventeen battles since
 he lurch'd all swords of the garland for this last
 before and in corioli let me say
 i cannot speak him home he stopp'd the fliers
 and by his rare example made the coward
 turn terror into sport as weeds before
 a vessel under sail so men obey'd
 and fell below his stem his sword death's stamp
 where it did mark it took from face to foot
 he was a thing of blood whose every motion
 was timed with dying cries alone he enter'd
 the mortal gate of the city which he painted
 with shunless destiny aidless came off
 and with a sudden reinforcement struck
 corioli like a planet now all's his
 when by and by the din of war gan pierce
 his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
 requicken'd what in flesh was fatigate
 and to the battle came he where he did
 run reeking o'er the lives of men as if
 twere a perpetual spoil and till we call'd
 both field and city ours he never stood
 to ease his breast with panting
menenius worthy man
first senator he cannot but with measure fit the honours
 which we devise him
cominius our spoils he kick'd at
 and look'd upon things precious as they were
 the common muck of the world he covets less
 than misery itself would give rewards
 his deeds with doing them and is content
 to spend the time to end it
menenius he's right noble
 let him be call'd for
first senator call coriolanus
officer he doth appear
 reenter coriolanus
menenius the senate coriolanus are well pleased
 to make thee consul
coriolanus i do owe them still
 my life and services
menenius it then remains
 that you do speak to the people
coriolanus i do beseech you
 let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot
 put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
 for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you
 that i may pass this doing
sicinius sir the people
 must have their voices neither will they bate
 one jot of ceremony
menenius put them not to't
 pray you go fit you to the custom and
 take to you as your predecessors have
 your honour with your form
coriolanus it is apart
 that i shall blush in acting and might well
 be taken from the people
brutus mark you that
coriolanus to brag unto them thus i did and thus
 show them the unaching scars which i should hide
 as if i had received them for the hire
 of their breath only
menenius do not stand upon't
 we recommend to you tribunes of the people
 our purpose to them and to our noble consul
 wish we all joy and honour
senators to coriolanus come all joy and honour
 flourish of cornets exeunt all but sicinius
 and brutus
brutus you see how he intends to use the people
sicinius may they perceive's intent he will require them
 as if he did contemn what he requested
 should be in them to give
brutus come we'll inform them
 of our proceedings here on the marketplace
 i know they do attend us
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act ii
scene iii the same the forum
 enter seven or eight citizens
first citizen once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him
second citizen we may sir if we will
third citizen we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
 power that we have no power to do for if he show us
 his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our
 tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if
 he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him
 our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is
 monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful
 were to make a monster of the multitude of the
 which we being members should bring ourselves to be
 monstrous members
first citizen and to make us no better thought of a little help
 will serve for once we stood up about the corn he
 himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude
third citizen we have been called so of many not that our heads
 are some brown some black some auburn some bald
 but that our wits are so diversely coloured and
 truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of
 one skull they would fly east west north south
 and their consent of one direct way should be at
 once to all the points o the compass
second citizen think you so which way do you judge my wit would
 fly
third citizen nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's
 will'tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but
 if it were at liberty twould sure southward
second citizen why that way
third citizen to lose itself in a fog where being three parts
 melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return
 for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife
second citizen you are never without your tricks you may you may
third citizen are you all resolved to give your voices but
 that's no matter the greater part carries it i
 say if he would incline to the people there was
 never a worthier man
 enter coriolanus in a gown of humility
 with menenius
 here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his
 behavior we are not to stay all together but to
 come by him where he stands by ones by twos and
 by threes he's to make his requests by
 particulars wherein every one of us has a single
 honour in giving him our own voices with our own
 tongues therefore follow me and i direct you how
 you shall go by him
all content content
 exeunt citizens
menenius o sir you are not right have you not known
 the worthiest men have done't
coriolanus what must i say
 i pray sir'plague upon't i cannot bring
 my tongue to such a pace'look sir my wounds
 i got them in my country's service when
 some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
 from the noise of our own drums'
menenius o me the gods
 you must not speak of that you must desire them
 to think upon you
coriolanus think upon me hang em
 i would they would forget me like the virtues
 which our divines lose by em
menenius you'll mar all
 i'll leave you pray you speak to em i pray you
 in wholesome manner
 exit
coriolanus bid them wash their faces
 and keep their teeth clean
 reenter two of the citizens
 so here comes a brace
 reenter a third citizen
 you know the cause air of my standing here
third citizen we do sir tell us what hath brought you to't
coriolanus mine own desert
second citizen your own desert
coriolanus ay but not mine own desire
third citizen how not your own desire
coriolanus no sir'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
 poor with begging
third citizen you must think if we give you any thing we hope to
 gain by you
coriolanus well then i pray your price o the consulship
first citizen the price is to ask it kindly
coriolanus kindly sir i pray let me ha't i have wounds to
 show you which shall be yours in private your
 good voice sir what say you
second citizen you shall ha it worthy sir
coriolanus a match sir there's in all two worthy voices
 begged i have your alms adieu
third citizen but this is something odd
second citizen an twere to give againbut tis no matter
 exeunt the three citizens
 reenter two other citizens
coriolanus pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
 voices that i may be consul i have here the
 customary gown
fourth citizen you have deserved nobly of your country and you
 have not deserved nobly
coriolanus your enigma
fourth citizen you have been a scourge to her enemies you have
 been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved
 the common people
coriolanus you should account me the more virtuous that i have
 not been common in my love i will sir flatter my
 sworn brother the people to earn a dearer
 estimation of them tis a condition they account
 gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is
 rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise
 the insinuating nod and be off to them most
 counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the
 bewitchment of some popular man and give it
 bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you
 i may be consul
fifth citizen we hope to find you our friend and therefore give
 you our voices heartily
fourth citizen you have received many wounds for your country
coriolanus i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i
 will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further
both citizens the gods give you joy sir heartily
 exeunt
coriolanus most sweet voices
 better it is to die better to starve
 than crave the hire which first we do deserve
 why in this woolvish toge should i stand here
 to beg of hob and dick that do appear
 their needless vouches custom calls me to't
 what custom wills in all things should we do't
 the dust on antique time would lie unswept
 and mountainous error be too highly heapt
 for truth to o'erpeer rather than fool it so
 let the high office and the honour go
 to one that would do thus i am half through
 the one part suffer'd the other will i do
 reenter three citizens more
 here come more voices
 your voices for your voices i have fought
 watch'd for your voices for your voices bear
 of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
 i have seen and heard of for your voices have
 done many things some less some more your voices
 indeed i would be consul
sixth citizen he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest
 man's voice
seventh citizen therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy
 and make him good friend to the people
all citizens amen amen god save thee noble consul
 exeunt
coriolanus worthy voices
 reenter menenius with brutus and sicinius
menenius you have stood your limitation and the tribunes
 endue you with the people's voice remains
 that in the official marks invested you
 anon do meet the senate
coriolanus is this done
sicinius the custom of request you have discharged
 the people do admit you and are summon'd
 to meet anon upon your approbation
coriolanus where at the senatehouse
sicinius there coriolanus
coriolanus may i change these garments
sicinius you may sir
coriolanus that i'll straight do and knowing myself again
 repair to the senatehouse
menenius i'll keep you company will you along
brutus we stay here for the people
sicinius fare you well
 exeunt coriolanus and menenius
 he has it now and by his looks methink
 tis warm at s heart
brutus with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds
 will you dismiss the people
 reenter citizens
sicinius how now my masters have you chose this man
first citizen he has our voices sir
brutus we pray the gods he may deserve your loves
second citizen amen sir to my poor unworthy notice
 he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices
third citizen certainly
 he flouted us downright
first citizen no'tis his kind of speech he did not mock us
second citizen not one amongst us save yourself but says
 he used us scornfully he should have show'd us
 his marks of merit wounds received for's country
sicinius why so he did i am sure
citizens no no no man saw em
third citizen he said he had wounds which he could show
 in private
 and with his hat thus waving it in scorn
 i would be consul says he aged custom
 but by your voices will not so permit me
 your voices therefore when we granted that
 here was i thank you for your voices thank you
 your most sweet voices now you have left
 your voices
 i have no further with you was not this mockery
sicinius why either were you ignorant to see't
 or seeing it of such childish friendliness
 to yield your voices
brutus could you not have told him
 as you were lesson'd when he had no power
 but was a petty servant to the state
 he was your enemy ever spake against
 your liberties and the charters that you bear
 i the body of the weal and now arriving
 a place of potency and sway o the state
 if he should still malignantly remain
 fast foe to the plebeii your voices might
 be curses to yourselves you should have said
 that as his worthy deeds did claim no less
 than what he stood for so his gracious nature
 would think upon you for your voices and
 translate his malice towards you into love
 standing your friendly lord
sicinius thus to have said
 as you were foreadvised had touch'd his spirit
 and tried his inclination from him pluck'd
 either his gracious promise which you might
 as cause had call'd you up have held him to
 or else it would have gall'd his surly nature
 which easily endures not article
 tying him to aught so putting him to rage
 you should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
 and pass'd him unelected
brutus did you perceive
 he did solicit you in free contempt
 when he did need your loves and do you think
 that his contempt shall not be bruising to you
 when he hath power to crush why had your bodies
 no heart among you or had you tongues to cry
 against the rectorship of judgment
sicinius have you
 ere now denied the asker and now again
 of him that did not ask but mock bestow
 your suedfor tongues
third citizen he's not confirm'd we may deny him yet
second citizen and will deny him
 i'll have five hundred voices of that sound
first citizen i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em
brutus get you hence instantly and tell those friends
 they have chose a consul that will from them take
 their liberties make them of no more voice
 than dogs that are as often beat for barking
 as therefore kept to do so
sicinius let them assemble
 and on a safer judgment all revoke
 your ignorant election enforce his pride
 and his old hate unto you besides forget not
 with what contempt he wore the humble weed
 how in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves
 thinking upon his services took from you
 the apprehension of his present portance
 which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
 after the inveterate hate he bears you
brutus lay
 a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured
 no impediment between but that you must
 cast your election on him
sicinius say you chose him
 more after our commandment than as guided
 by your own true affections and that your minds
 preoccupied with what you rather must do
 than what you should made you against the grain
 to voice him consul lay the fault on us
brutus ay spare us not say we read lectures to you
 how youngly he began to serve his country
 how long continued and what stock he springs of
 the noble house o the marcians from whence came
 that ancus marcius numa's daughter's son
 who after great hostilius here was king
 of the same house publius and quintus were
 that our beat water brought by conduits hither
 and censorinus nobly named so
 twice being by the people chosen censor
 was his great ancestor
sicinius one thus descended
 that hath beside well in his person wrought
 to be set high in place we did commend
 to your remembrances but you have found
 scaling his present bearing with his past
 that he's your fixed enemy and revoke
 your sudden approbation
brutus say you ne'er had done't
 harp on that stillbut by our putting on
 and presently when you have drawn your number
 repair to the capitol
all we will so almost all
 repent in their election
 exeunt citizens
brutus let them go on
 this mutiny were better put in hazard
 than stay past doubt for greater
 if as his nature is he fall in rage
 with their refusal both observe and answer
 the vantage of his anger
sicinius to the capitol come
 we will be there before the stream o the people
 and this shall seem as partly tis their own
 which we have goaded onward

act iii
scene i rome a street
 cornets enter coriolanus menenius all the
 gentry cominius titus lartius and other senators
coriolanus tullus aufidius then had made new head
lartius he had my lord and that it was which caused
 our swifter composition
coriolanus so then the volsces stand but as at first
 ready when time shall prompt them to make road
 upon's again
cominius they are worn lord consul so
 that we shall hardly in our ages see
 their banners wave again
coriolanus saw you aufidius
lartius on safeguard he came to me and did curse
 against the volsces for they had so vilely
 yielded the town he is retired to antium
coriolanus spoke he of me
lartius he did my lord
coriolanus how what
lartius how often he had met you sword to sword
 that of all things upon the earth he hated
 your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
 to hopeless restitution so he might
 be call'd your vanquisher
coriolanus at antium lives he
lartius at antium
coriolanus i wish i had a cause to seek him there
 to oppose his hatred fully welcome home
 enter sicinius and brutus
 behold these are the tribunes of the people
 the tongues o the common mouth i do despise them
 for they do prank them in authority
 against all noble sufferance
sicinius pass no further
coriolanus ha what is that
brutus it will be dangerous to go on no further
coriolanus what makes this change
menenius the matter
cominius hath he not pass'd the noble and the common
brutus cominius no
coriolanus have i had children's voices
first senator tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace
brutus the people are incensed against him
sicinius stop
 or all will fall in broil
coriolanus are these your herd
 must these have voices that can yield them now
 and straight disclaim their tongues what are
 your offices
 you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
 have you not set them on
menenius be calm be calm
coriolanus it is a purposed thing and grows by plot
 to curb the will of the nobility
 suffer't and live with such as cannot rule
 nor ever will be ruled
brutus call't not a plot
 the people cry you mock'd them and of late
 when corn was given them gratis you repined
 scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them
 timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
coriolanus why this was known before
brutus not to them all
coriolanus have you inform'd them sithence
brutus how i inform them
coriolanus you are like to do such business
brutus not unlike
 each way to better yours
coriolanus why then should i be consul by yond clouds
 let me deserve so ill as you and make me
 your fellow tribune
sicinius you show too much of that
 for which the people stir if you will pass
 to where you are bound you must inquire your way
 which you are out of with a gentler spirit
 or never be so noble as a consul
 nor yoke with him for tribune
menenius let's be calm
cominius the people are abused set on this paltering
 becomes not rome nor has coriolanus
 deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely
 i the plain way of his merit
coriolanus tell me of corn
 this was my speech and i will speak't again
menenius not now not now
first senator not in this heat sir now
coriolanus now as i live i will my nobler friends
 i crave their pardons
 for the mutable rankscented many let them
 regard me as i do not flatter and
 therein behold themselves i say again
 in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate
 the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
 which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd
 and scatter'd
 by mingling them with us the honour'd number
 who lack not virtue no nor power but that
 which they have given to beggars
menenius well no more
first senator no more words we beseech you
coriolanus how no more
 as for my country i have shed my blood
 not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
 coin words till their decay against those measles
 which we disdain should tatter us yet sought
 the very way to catch them
brutus you speak o the people
 as if you were a god to punish not
 a man of their infirmity
sicinius twere well
 we let the people know't
menenius what what his choler
coriolanus choler
 were i as patient as the midnight sleep
 by jove twould be my mind
sicinius it is a mind
 that shall remain a poison where it is
 not poison any further
coriolanus shall remain
 hear you this triton of the minnows mark you
 his absolute shall'
cominius twas from the canon
coriolanus shall'
 o good but most unwise patricians why
 you grave but reckless senators have you thus
 given hydra here to choose an officer
 that with his peremptory shall being but
 the horn and noise o the monster's wants not spirit
 to say he'll turn your current in a ditch
 and make your channel his if he have power
 then vail your ignorance if none awake
 your dangerous lenity if you are learn'd
 be not as common fools if you are not
 let them have cushions by you you are plebeians
 if they be senators and they are no less
 when both your voices blended the great'st taste
 most palates theirs they choose their magistrate
 and such a one as he who puts his shall'
 his popular shall against a graver bench
 than ever frown in greece by jove himself
 it makes the consuls base and my soul aches
 to know when two authorities are up
 neither supreme how soon confusion
 may enter twixt the gap of both and take
 the one by the other
cominius well on to the marketplace
coriolanus whoever gave that counsel to give forth
 the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used
 sometime in greece
menenius well well no more of that
coriolanus though there the people had more absolute power
 i say they nourish'd disobedience fed
 the ruin of the state
brutus why shall the people give
 one that speaks thus their voice
coriolanus i'll give my reasons
 more worthier than their voices they know the corn
 was not our recompense resting well assured
 that ne'er did service for't being press'd to the war
 even when the navel of the state was touch'd
 they would not thread the gates this kind of service
 did not deserve corn gratis being i the war
 their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd
 most valour spoke not for them the accusation
 which they have often made against the senate
 all cause unborn could never be the motive
 of our so frank donation well what then
 how shall this bisson multitude digest
 the senate's courtesy let deeds express
 what's like to be their words we did request it
 we are the greater poll and in true fear
 they gave us our demands thus we debase
 the nature of our seats and make the rabble
 call our cares fears which will in time
 break ope the locks o the senate and bring in
 the crows to peck the eagles
menenius come enough
brutus enough with overmeasure
coriolanus no take more
 what may be sworn by both divine and human
 seal what i end withal this double worship
 where one part does disdain with cause the other
 insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
 cannot conclude but by the yea and no
 of general ignoranceit must omit
 real necessities and give way the while
 to unstable slightness purpose so barr'd
 it follows
 nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you
 you that will be less fearful than discreet
 that love the fundamental part of state
 more than you doubt the change on't that prefer
 a noble life before a long and wish
 to jump a body with a dangerous physic
 that's sure of death without it at once pluck out
 the multitudinous tongue let them not lick
 the sweet which is their poison your dishonour
 mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
 of that integrity which should become't
 not having the power to do the good it would
 for the in which doth control't
brutus has said enough
sicinius has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
 as traitors do
coriolanus thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee
 what should the people do with these bald tribunes
 on whom depending their obedience fails
 to the greater bench in a rebellion
 when what's not meet but what must be was law
 then were they chosen in a better hour
 let what is meet be said it must be meet
 and throw their power i the dust
brutus manifest treason
sicinius this a consul no
brutus the aediles ho
 enter an aedile
 let him be apprehended
sicinius go call the people
 exit aedile
 in whose name myself
 attach thee as a traitorous innovator
 a foe to the public weal obey i charge thee
 and follow to thine answer
coriolanus hence old goat
senators &c we'll surety him
cominius aged sir hands off
coriolanus hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones
 out of thy garments
sicinius help ye citizens
 enter a rabble of citizens plebeians with
 the aediles
menenius on both sides more respect
sicinius here's he that would take from you all your power
brutus seize him aediles
citizens down with him down with him
senators &c weapons weapons weapons
 they all bustle about coriolanus crying
 tribunes patricians citizens what ho'
 sicinius brutus coriolanus citizens'
 peace peace peace stay hold peace'
menenius what is about to be i am out of breath
 confusion's near i cannot speak you tribunes
 to the people coriolanus patience
 speak good sicinius
sicinius hear me people peace
citizens let's hear our tribune peace speak speak speak
sicinius you are at point to lose your liberties
 marcius would have all from you marcius
 whom late you have named for consul
menenius fie fie fie
 this is the way to kindle not to quench
first senator to unbuild the city and to lay all flat
sicinius what is the city but the people
citizens true
 the people are the city
brutus by the consent of all we were establish'd
 the people's magistrates
citizens you so remain
menenius and so are like to do
cominius that is the way to lay the city flat
 to bring the roof to the foundation
 and bury all which yet distinctly ranges
 in heaps and piles of ruin
sicinius this deserves death
brutus or let us stand to our authority
 or let us lose it we do here pronounce
 upon the part o the people in whose power
 we were elected theirs marcius is worthy
 of present death
sicinius therefore lay hold of him
 bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence
 into destruction cast him
brutus aediles seize him
citizens yield marcius yield
menenius hear me one word
 beseech you tribunes hear me but a word
aedile peace peace
menenius to brutus be that you seem truly your
 country's friend
 and temperately proceed to what you would
 thus violently redress
brutus sir those cold ways
 that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
 where the disease is violent lay hands upon him
 and bear him to the rock
coriolanus no i'll die here
 drawing his sword
 there's some among you have beheld me fighting
 come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
menenius down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile
brutus lay hands upon him
cominius help marcius help
 you that be noble help him young and old
citizens down with him down with him
 in this mutiny the tribunes the aediles and the
 people are beat in
menenius go get you to your house be gone away
 all will be naught else
second senator get you gone
cominius stand fast
 we have as many friends as enemies
menenius sham it be put to that
first senator the gods forbid
 i prithee noble friend home to thy house
 leave us to cure this cause
menenius for tis a sore upon us
 you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you
cominius come sir along with us
coriolanus i would they were barbariansas they are
 though in rome litter'dnot romansas they are not
 though calved i the porch o the capitol
menenius be gone
 put not your worthy rage into your tongue
 one time will owe another
coriolanus on fair ground
 i could beat forty of them
cominius i could myself
 take up a brace o the best of them yea the
 two tribunes
 but now tis odds beyond arithmetic
 and manhood is call'd foolery when it stands
 against a falling fabric will you hence
 before the tag return whose rage doth rend
 like interrupted waters and o'erbear
 what they are used to bear
menenius pray you be gone
 i'll try whether my old wit be in request
 with those that have but little this must be patch'd
 with cloth of any colour
cominius nay come away
 exeunt coriolanus cominius and others
a patrician this man has marr'd his fortune
menenius his nature is too noble for the world
 he would not flatter neptune for his trident
 or jove for's power to thunder his heart's his mouth
 what his breast forges that his tongue must vent
 and being angry does forget that ever
 he heard the name of death
 a noise within
 here's goodly work
second patrician i would they were abed
menenius i would they were in tiber what the vengeance
 could he not speak em fair
 reenter brutus and sicinius with the rabble
sicinius where is this viper
 that would depopulate the city and
 be every man himself
menenius you worthy tribunes
sicinius he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock
 with rigorous hands he hath resisted law
 and therefore law shall scorn him further trial
 than the severity of the public power
 which he so sets at nought
first citizen he shall well know
 the noble tribunes are the people's mouths
 and we their hands
citizens he shall sure on't
menenius sir sir
sicinius peace
menenius do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
 with modest warrant
sicinius sir how comes't that you
 have holp to make this rescue
menenius hear me speak
 as i do know the consul's worthiness
 so can i name his faults
sicinius consul what consul
menenius the consul coriolanus
brutus he consul
citizens no no no no no
menenius if by the tribunes leave and yours good people
 i may be heard i would crave a word or two
 the which shall turn you to no further harm
 than so much loss of time
sicinius speak briefly then
 for we are peremptory to dispatch
 this viperous traitor to eject him hence
 were but one danger and to keep him here
 our certain death therefore it is decreed
 he dies tonight
menenius now the good gods forbid
 that our renowned rome whose gratitude
 towards her deserved children is enroll'd
 in jove's own book like an unnatural dam
 should now eat up her own
sicinius he's a disease that must be cut away
menenius o he's a limb that has but a disease
 mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
 what has he done to rome that's worthy death
 killing our enemies the blood he hath lost
 which i dare vouch is more than that he hath
 by many an ouncehe dropp'd it for his country
 and what is left to lose it by his country
 were to us all that do't and suffer it
 a brand to the end o the world
sicinius this is clean kam
brutus merely awry when he did love his country
 it honour'd him
menenius the service of the foot
 being once gangrened is not then respected
 for what before it was
brutus we'll hear no more
 pursue him to his house and pluck him thence
 lest his infection being of catching nature
 spread further
menenius one word more one word
 this tigerfooted rage when it shall find
 the harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late
 tie leaden pounds to's heels proceed by process
 lest parties as he is beloved break out
 and sack great rome with romans
brutus if it were so
sicinius what do ye talk
 have we not had a taste of his obedience
 our aediles smote ourselves resisted come
menenius consider this he has been bred i the wars
 since he could draw a sword and is ill school'd
 in bolted language meal and bran together
 he throws without distinction give me leave
 i'll go to him and undertake to bring him
 where he shall answer by a lawful form
 in peace to his utmost peril
first senator noble tribunes
 it is the humane way the other course
 will prove too bloody and the end of it
 unknown to the beginning
sicinius noble menenius
 be you then as the people's officer
 masters lay down your weapons
brutus go not home
sicinius meet on the marketplace we'll attend you there
 where if you bring not marcius we'll proceed
 in our first way
menenius i'll bring him to you
 to the senators
 let me desire your company he must come
 or what is worst will follow
first senator pray you let's to him

scene ii a room in coriolanus's house
 enter coriolanus with patricians
coriolanus let them puff all about mine ears present me
 death on the wheel or at wild horses heels
 or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock
 that the precipitation might down stretch
 below the beam of sight yet will i still
 be thus to them
a patrician you do the nobler
coriolanus i muse my mother
 does not approve me further who was wont
 to call them woollen vassals things created
 to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
 in congregations to yawn be still and wonder
 when one but of my ordinance stood up
 to speak of peace or war
 enter volumnia
 i talk of you
 why did you wish me milder would you have me
 false to my nature rather say i play
 the man i am
volumnia o sir sir sir
 i would have had you put your power well on
 before you had worn it out
coriolanus let go
volumnia you might have been enough the man you are
 with striving less to be so lesser had been
 the thwartings of your dispositions if
 you had not show'd them how ye were disposed
 ere they lack'd power to cross you
coriolanus let them hang
a patrician ay and burn too
 enter menenius and senators
menenius come come you have been too rough something
 too rough
 you must return and mend it
first senator there's no remedy
 unless by not so doing our good city
 cleave in the midst and perish
volumnia pray be counsell'd
 i have a heart as little apt as yours
 but yet a brain that leads my use of anger
 to better vantage
menenius well said noble woman
 before he should thus stoop to the herd but that
 the violent fit o the time craves it as physic
 for the whole state i would put mine armour on
 which i can scarcely bear
coriolanus what must i do
menenius return to the tribunes
coriolanus well what then what then
menenius repent what you have spoke
coriolanus for them i cannot do it to the gods
 must i then do't to them
volumnia you are too absolute
 though therein you can never be too noble
 but when extremities speak i have heard you say
 honour and policy like unsever'd friends
 i the war do grow together grant that and tell me
 in peace what each of them by the other lose
 that they combine not there
coriolanus tush tush
menenius a good demand
volumnia if it be honour in your wars to seem
 the same you are not which for your best ends
 you adopt your policy how is it less or worse
 that it shall hold companionship in peace
 with honour as in war since that to both
 it stands in like request
coriolanus why force you this
volumnia because that now it lies you on to speak
 to the people not by your own instruction
 nor by the matter which your heart prompts you
 but with such words that are but rooted in
 your tongue though but bastards and syllables
 of no allowance to your bosom's truth
 now this no more dishonours you at all
 than to take in a town with gentle words
 which else would put you to your fortune and
 the hazard of much blood
 i would dissemble with my nature where
 my fortunes and my friends at stake required
 i should do so in honour i am in this
 your wife your son these senators the nobles
 and you will rather show our general louts
 how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em
 for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
 of what that want might ruin
menenius noble lady
 come go with us speak fair you may salve so
 not what is dangerous present but the loss
 of what is past
volumnia i prithee now my son
 go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
 and thus far having stretch'd ithere be with them
 thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business
 action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant
 more learned than the earswaving thy head
 which often thus correcting thy stout heart
 now humble as the ripest mulberry
 that will not hold the handling or say to them
 thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
 hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
 were fit for thee to use as they to claim
 in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
 thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
 as thou hast power and person
menenius this but done
 even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
 for they have pardons being ask'd as free
 as words to little purpose
volumnia prithee now
 go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather
 follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
 than flatter him in a bower here is cominius
 enter cominius
cominius i have been i the marketplace and sir'tis fit
 you make strong party or defend yourself
 by calmness or by absence all's in anger
menenius only fair speech
cominius i think twill serve if he
 can thereto frame his spirit
volumnia he must and will
 prithee now say you will and go about it
coriolanus must i go show them my unbarbed sconce
 must i with base tongue give my noble heart
 a lie that it must bear well i will do't
 yet were there but this single plot to lose
 this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it
 and throw't against the wind to the marketplace
 you have put me now to such a part which never
 i shall discharge to the life
cominius come come we'll prompt you
volumnia i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
 my praises made thee first a soldier so
 to have my praise for this perform a part
 thou hast not done before
coriolanus well i must do't
 away my disposition and possess me
 some harlot's spirit my throat of war be turn'd
 which quired with my drum into a pipe
 small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
 that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves
 tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up
 the glasses of my sight a beggar's tongue
 make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees
 who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his
 that hath received an alms i will not do't
 lest i surcease to honour mine own truth
 and by my body's action teach my mind
 a most inherent baseness
volumnia at thy choice then
 to beg of thee it is my more dishonour
 than thou of them come all to ruin let
 thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
 thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death
 with as big heart as thou do as thou list
 thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me
 but owe thy pride thyself
coriolanus pray be content
 mother i am going to the marketplace
 chide me no more i'll mountebank their loves
 cog their hearts from them and come home beloved
 of all the trades in rome look i am going
 commend me to my wife i'll return consul
 or never trust to what my tongue can do
 i the way of flattery further
volumnia do your will
 exit
cominius away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself
 to answer mildly for they are prepared
 with accusations as i hear more strong
 than are upon you yet
coriolanus the word is mildly pray you let us go
 let them accuse me by invention i
 will answer in mine honour
menenius ay but mildly

 was ne'er distributed
 enter an aedile
 what will he come
aedile he's coming
brutus how accompanied
aedile with old menenius and those senators
 that always favour'd him
sicinius have you a catalogue
 of all the voices that we have procured
 set down by the poll
aedile i have tis ready
sicinius have you collected them by tribes
aedile i have
sicinius assemble presently the people hither
 and when they bear me say it shall be so
 i the right and strength o the commons be it either
 for death for fine or banishment then let them
 if i say fine cry fine if death cry death'
 insisting on the old prerogative
 and power i the truth o the cause
aedile i shall inform them
brutus and when such time they have begun to cry
 let them not cease but with a din confused
 enforce the present execution
 of what we chance to sentence
aedile very well
sicinius make them be strong and ready for this hint
 when we shall hap to give t them
brutus go about it
 exit aedile
 put him to choler straight he hath been used
 ever to conquer and to have his worth
 of contradiction being once chafed he cannot
 be rein'd again to temperance then he speaks
 what's in his heart and that is there which looks
 with us to break his neck
sicinius well here he comes
 enter coriolanus menenius and cominius
 with senators and patricians
menenius calmly i do beseech you
coriolanus ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece
 will bear the knave by the volume the honour'd gods
 keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice
 supplied with worthy men plant love among s
 throng our large temples with the shows of peace
 and not our streets with war
first senator amen amen
menenius a noble wish
 reenter aedile with citizens
sicinius draw near ye people
aedile list to your tribunes audience peace i say
coriolanus first hear me speak
both tribunes well say peace ho
coriolanus shall i be charged no further than this present
 must all determine here
sicinius i do demand
 if you submit you to the people's voices
 allow their officers and are content
 to suffer lawful censure for such faults
 as shall be proved upon you
coriolanus i am content
menenius lo citizens he says he is content
 the warlike service he has done consider think
 upon the wounds his body bears which show
 like graves i the holy churchyard
coriolanus scratches with briers
 scars to move laughter only
menenius consider further
 that when he speaks not like a citizen
 you find him like a soldier do not take
 his rougher accents for malicious sounds
 but as i say such as become a soldier
 rather than envy you
cominius well well no more
coriolanus what is the matter
 that being pass'd for consul with full voice
 i am so dishonour'd that the very hour
 you take it off again
sicinius answer to us
coriolanus say then tis true i ought so
sicinius we charge you that you have contrived to take
 from rome all season'd office and to wind
 yourself into a power tyrannical
 for which you are a traitor to the people
coriolanus how traitor
menenius nay temperately your promise
coriolanus the fires i the lowest hell foldin the people
 call me their traitor thou injurious tribune
 within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
 in thy hand clutch'd as many millions in
 thy lying tongue both numbers i would say
 thou liest unto thee with a voice as free
 as i do pray the gods
sicinius mark you this people
citizens to the rock to the rock with him
sicinius peace
 we need not put new matter to his charge
 what you have seen him do and heard him speak
 beating your officers cursing yourselves
 opposing laws with strokes and here defying
 those whose great power must try him even this
 so criminal and in such capital kind
 deserves the extremest death
brutus but since he hath
 served well for rome
coriolanus what do you prate of service
brutus i talk of that that know it
coriolanus you
menenius is this the promise that you made your mother
cominius know i pray you
coriolanus i know no further
 let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death
 vagabond exile raying pent to linger
 but with a grain a day i would not buy
 their mercy at the price of one fair word
 nor cheque my courage for what they can give
 to have't with saying good morrow'
sicinius for that he has
 as much as in him lies from time to time
 envied against the people seeking means
 to pluck away their power as now at last
 given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
 of dreaded justice but on the ministers
 that do distribute it in the name o the people
 and in the power of us the tribunes we
 even from this instant banish him our city
 in peril of precipitation
 from off the rock tarpeian never more
 to enter our rome gates i the people's name
 i say it shall be so
citizens it shall be so it shall be so let him away
 he's banish'd and it shall be so
cominius hear me my masters and my common friends
sicinius he's sentenced no more hearing
cominius let me speak
 i have been consul and can show for rome
 her enemies marks upon me i do love
 my country's good with a respect more tender
 more holy and profound than mine own life
 my dear wife's estimate her womb's increase
 and treasure of my loins then if i would
 speak that
sicinius we know your drift speak what
brutus there's no more to be said but he is banish'd
 as enemy to the people and his country
 it shall be so
citizens it shall be so it shall be so
coriolanus you common cry of curs whose breath i hate
 as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize
 as the dead carcasses of unburied men
 that do corrupt my air i banish you
 and here remain with your uncertainty
 let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
 your enemies with nodding of their plumes
 fan you into despair have the power still
 to banish your defenders till at length
 your ignorance which finds not till it feels
 making not reservation of yourselves
 still your own foes deliver you as most
 abated captives to some nation
 that won you without blows despising
 for you the city thus i turn my back
 there is a world elsewhere
 exeunt coriolanus cominius menenius senators
 and patricians
aedile the people's enemy is gone is gone
citizens our enemy is banish'd he is gone hoo hoo

 give him deserved vexation let a guard
 attend us through the city
citizens come come let's see him out at gates come

 to say extremity was the trier of spirits
 that common chances common men could bear
 that when the sea was calm all boats alike
 show'd mastership in floating fortune's blows
 when most struck home being gentle wounded craves
 a noble cunning you were used to load me
 with precepts that would make invincible
 the heart that conn'd them
virgilia o heavens o heavens

 more than a wild exposture to each chance
 that starts i the way before thee

cominius i'll follow thee a month devise with thee
 where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
 and we of thee so if the time thrust forth
 a cause for thy repeal we shall not send
 o'er the vast world to seek a single man
 and lose advantage which doth ever cool
 i the absence of the needer
coriolanus fare ye well
 thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full
 of the wars surfeits to go rove with one
 that's yet unbruised bring me but out at gate
 come my sweet wife my dearest mother and
 my friends of noble touch when i am forth

 so to heart the banishment of that worthy
 coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
 all power from the people and to pluck from them

 tell you and is almost mature for the violent
 breaking out
volsce coriolanus banished
roman banished sir
volsce you will be welcome with this intelligence nicanor

 their adversaries have you an army ready say you

aufidius whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name
 why speak'st not speak man what's thy name
coriolanus if tullus
 unmuffling
 not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not
 think me for the man i am necessity
 commands me name myself
aufidius what is thy name
coriolanus a name unmusical to the volscians ears
 and harsh in sound to thine
aufidius say what's thy name
 thou hast a grim appearance and thy face
 bears a command in't though thy tackle's torn
 thou show'st a noble vessel what's thy name
coriolanus prepare thy brow to frown know'st
 thou me yet
aufidius i know thee not thy name
coriolanus my name is caius marcius who hath done
 to thee particularly and to all the volsces
 great hurt and mischief thereto witness may
 my surname coriolanus the painful service
 the extreme dangers and the drops of blood
 shed for my thankless country are requited
 but with that surname a good memory
 and witness of the malice and displeasure
 which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains
 the cruelty and envy of the people
 permitted by our dastard nobles who
 have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest
 and suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
 whoop'd out of rome now this extremity
 hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope
 mistake me notto save my life for if
 i had fear'd death of all the men i the world
 i would have voided thee but in mere spite
 to be full quit of those my banishers
 stand i before thee here then if thou hast
 a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge
 thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
 of shame seen through thy country speed
 thee straight
 and make my misery serve thy turn so use it
 that my revengeful services may prove
 as benefits to thee for i will fight
 against my canker'd country with the spleen
 of all the under fiends but if so be
 thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
 thou'rt tired then in a word i also am
 longer to live most weary and present
 my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
 which not to cut would show thee but a fool
 since i have ever follow'd thee with hate
 drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast
 and cannot live but to thy shame unless
 it be to do thee service
aufidius o marcius marcius
 each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
 a root of ancient envy if jupiter
 should from yond cloud speak divine things
 and say tis true i'ld not believe them more
 than thee all noble marcius let me twine
 mine arms about that body where against
 my grained ash an hundred times hath broke
 and scarr'd the moon with splinters here i clip
 the anvil of my sword and do contest
 as hotly and as nobly with thy love
 as ever in ambitious strength i did
 contend against thy valour know thou first
 i loved the maid i married never man
 sigh'd truer breath but that i see thee here
 thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
 than when i first my wedded mistress saw
 bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee
 we have a power on foot and i had purpose
 once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
 or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out
 twelve several times and i have nightly since
 dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me
 we have been down together in my sleep
 unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat
 and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius
 had we no quarrel else to rome but that
 thou art thence banish'd we would muster all
 from twelve to seventy and pouring war
 into the bowels of ungrateful rome
 like a bold flood o'erbear o come go in
 and take our friendly senators by the hands
 who now are here taking their leaves of me
 who am prepared against your territories
 though not for rome itself
coriolanus you bless me gods
aufidius therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
 the leading of thine own revenges take
 the one half of my commission and set down
 as best thou art experienced since thou know'st
 thy country's strength and weaknessthine own ways
 whether to knock against the gates of rome
 or rudely visit them in parts remote
 to fright them ere destroy but come in
 let me commend thee first to those that shall
 say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes
 and more a friend than e'er an enemy
 yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome
 exeunt coriolanus and aufidius the two
 servingmen come forward
first servingman here's a strange alteration
second servingman by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with
 a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
 false report of him
first servingman what an arm he has he turned me about with his
 finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
second servingman nay i knew by his face that there was something in
 him he had sir a kind of face methoughti
 cannot tell how to term it
first servingman he had so looking as it werewould i were hanged
 but i thought there was more in him than i could think
second servingman so did i i'll be sworn he is simply the rarest
 man i the world
first servingman i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on
second servingman who my master
first servingman nay it's no matter for that
second servingman worth six on him
first servingman nay not so neither but i take him to be the
 greater soldier
second servingman faith look you one cannot tell how to say that
 for the defence of a town our general is excellent
first servingman ay and for an assault too
 reenter third servingman
third servingman o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals
first servingman 
 what what what let's partake
second servingman 
third servingman i would not be a roman of all nations i had as
 lieve be a condemned man
first servingman 
 wherefore wherefore
second servingman 
third servingman why here's he that was wont to thwack our general
 caius marcius
first servingman why do you say thwack our general 
third servingman i do not say thwack our general but he was always
 good enough for him
second servingman come we are fellows and friends he was ever too
 hard for him i have heard him say so himself
first servingman he was too hard for him directly to say the troth
 on't before corioli he scotched him and notched
 him like a carbon ado
second servingman an he had been cannibally given he might have
 broiled and eaten him too
first servingman but more of thy news
third servingman why he is so made on here within as if he were son
 and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no
 question asked him by any of the senators but they
 stand bald before him our general himself makes a
 mistress of him sanctifies himself with's hand and
 turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but
 the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
 the middle and but one half of what he was
 yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty
 and grant of the whole table he'll go he says
 and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he
 will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled
second servingman and he's as like to do't as any man i can imagine
third servingman do't he will do't for look you sir he has as
 many friends as enemies which friends sir as it
 were durst not look you sir show themselves as
 we term it his friends whilst he's in directitude
first servingman directitude what's that
third servingman but when they shall see sir his crest up again
 and the man in blood they will out of their
 burrows like conies after rain and revel all with
 him
first servingman but when goes this forward
third servingman tomorrow today presently you shall have the
 drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a
 parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they
 wipe their lips
second servingman why then we shall have a stirring world again
 this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase
 tailors and breed balladmakers
first servingman let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as
 day does night it's spritely waking audible and
 full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy
 mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more
 bastard children than war's a destroyer of men
second servingman tis so and as war in some sort may be said to
 be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a
 great maker of cuckolds
first servingman ay and it makes men hate one another
third servingman reason because they then less need one another
 the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap
 as volscians they are rising they are rising
all in in in in

sicinius we hear not of him neither need we fear him
 his remedies are tame i the present peace
 and quietness of the people which before
 were in wild hurry here do we make his friends
 blush that the world goes well who rather had
 though they themselves did suffer by't behold
 dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
 our tradesmen with in their shops and going
 about their functions friendly
brutus we stood to't in good time
 enter menenius
 is this menenius
sicinius tis he'tis he o he is grown most kind of late
both tribunes hail sir
menenius hail to you both
sicinius your coriolanus
 is not much miss'd but with his friends
 the commonwealth doth stand and so would do
 were he more angry at it
menenius all's well and might have been much better if
 he could have temporized
sicinius where is he hear you
menenius nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife
 hear nothing from him
 enter three or four citizens
citizens the gods preserve you both

brutus godden to you all godden to you all
first citizen ourselves our wives and children on our knees
 are bound to pray for you both

brutus farewell kind neighbours we wish'd coriolanus
 had loved you as we did
citizens now the gods keep you
both tribunes farewell farewell
 exeunt citizens
sicinius this is a happier and more comely time
 than when these fellows ran about the streets
 crying confusion
brutus caius marcius was
 a worthy officer i the war but insolent
 o'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
 selfloving
sicinius and affecting one sole throne
 without assistance
menenius i think not so
sicinius we should by this to all our lamentation
 if he had gone forth consul found it so
brutus the gods have well prevented it and rome
 sits safe and still without him
 enter an aedile
aedile worthy tribunes
 there is a slave whom we have put in prison
 reports the volsces with two several powers
 are enter'd in the roman territories
 and with the deepest malice of the war
 destroy what lies before em
menenius tis aufidius
 who hearing of our marcius banishment
 thrusts forth his horns again into the world
 which were inshell'd when marcius stood for rome
 and durst not once peep out
sicinius come what talk you
 of marcius
brutus go see this rumourer whipp'd it cannot be
 the volsces dare break with us
menenius cannot be
 we have record that very well it can
 and three examples of the like have been
 within my age but reason with the fellow
 before you punish him where he heard this
 lest you shall chance to whip your information
 and beat the messenger who bids beware
 of what is to be dreaded
sicinius tell not me
 i know this cannot be
brutus not possible
 enter a messenger
messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going
 all to the senatehouse some news is come
 that turns their countenances
sicinius tis this slave
 go whip him fore the people's eyeshis raising
 nothing but his report
messenger yes worthy sir
 the slave's report is seconded and more
 more fearful is deliver'd
sicinius what more fearful
messenger it is spoke freely out of many mouths
 how probable i do not knowthat marcius
 join'd with aufidius leads a power gainst rome
 and vows revenge as spacious as between
 the young'st and oldest thing
sicinius this is most likely
brutus raised only that the weaker sort may wish
 good marcius home again
sicinius the very trick on't
menenius this is unlikely
 he and aufidius can no more atone
 than violentest contrariety
 enter a second messenger
second messenger you are sent for to the senate
 a fearful army led by caius marcius
 associated with aufidius rages
 upon our territories and have already
 o'erborne their way consumed with fire and took
 what lay before them
 enter cominius
cominius o you have made good work
menenius what news what news
cominius you have holp to ravish your own daughters and
 to melt the city leads upon your pates
 to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses
menenius what's the news what's the news
cominius your temples burned in their cement and
 your franchises whereon you stood confined
 into an auger's bore
menenius pray now your news
 you have made fair work i fear mepray your news
 if marcius should be join'd with volscians
cominius if
 he is their god he leads them like a thing
 made by some other deity than nature
 that shapes man better and they follow him
 against us brats with no less confidence
 than boys pursuing summer butterflies
 or butchers killing flies
menenius you have made good work
 you and your apronmen you that stood so up much
 on the voice of occupation and
 the breath of garliceaters
cominius he will shake
 your rome about your ears
menenius as hercules
 did shake down mellow fruit
 you have made fair work
brutus but is this true sir
cominius ay and you'll look pale
 before you find it other all the regions
 do smilingly revolt and who resist
 are mock'd for valiant ignorance
 and perish constant fools who is't can blame him
 your enemies and his find something in him
menenius we are all undone unless
 the noble man have mercy
cominius who shall ask it
 the tribunes cannot do't for shame the people
 deserve such pity of him as the wolf
 does of the shepherds for his best friends if they
 should say be good to rome they charged him even
 as those should do that had deserved his hate
 and therein show'd like enemies
menenius tis true
 if he were putting to my house the brand
 that should consume it i have not the face
 to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands
 you and your crafts you have crafted fair
cominius you have brought
 a trembling upon rome such as was never
 so incapable of help
both tribunes say not we brought it
menenius how was it we we loved him but like beasts
 and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
 who did hoot him out o the city
cominius but i fear
 they'll roar him in again tullus aufidius
 the second name of men obeys his points
 as if he were his officer desperation
 is all the policy strength and defence
 that rome can make against them
 enter a troop of citizens
menenius here come the clusters
 and is aufidius with him you are they
 that made the air unwholesome when you cast
 your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
 coriolanus exile now he's coming
 and not a hair upon a soldier's head
 which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs
 as you threw caps up will he tumble down
 and pay you for your voices tis no matter
 if he could burn us all into one coal
 we have deserved it
citizens faith we hear fearful news
first citizen for mine own part
 when i said banish him i said twas pity
second citizen and so did i
third citizen and so did i and to say the truth so did very
 many of us that we did we did for the best and
 though we willingly consented to his banishment yet
 it was against our will
cominius ye re goodly things you voices
menenius you have made
 good work you and your cry shall's to the capitol
cominius o ay what else
 exeunt cominius and menenius
sicinius go masters get you home be not dismay'd
 these are a side that would be glad to have
 this true which they so seem to fear go home
 and show no sign of fear
first citizen the gods be good to us come masters let's home
 i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished
 him
second citizen so did we all but come let's home

act iv
scene vii a camp at a small distance from rome
 enter aufidius and his lieutenant
aufidius do they still fly to the roman
lieutenant i do not know what witchcraft's in him but
 your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
 their talk at table and their thanks at end
 and you are darken'd in this action sir
 even by your own
aufidius i cannot help it now
 unless by using means i lame the foot
 of our design he bears himself more proudlier
 even to my person than i thought he would
 when first i did embrace him yet his nature
 in that's no changeling and i must excuse
 what cannot be amended
lieutenant yet i wish sir
 i mean for your particularyou had not
 join'd in commission with him but either
 had borne the action of yourself or else
 to him had left it solely
aufidius i understand thee well and be thou sure
 when he shall come to his account he knows not
 what i can urge against him although it seems
 and so he thinks and is no less apparent
 to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
 and shows good husbandry for the volscian state
 fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon
 as draw his sword yet he hath left undone
 that which shall break his neck or hazard mine
 whene'er we come to our account
lieutenant sir i beseech you think you he'll carry rome
aufidius all places yield to him ere he sits down
 and the nobility of rome are his
 the senators and patricians love him too
 the tribunes are no soldiers and their people
 will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
 to expel him thence i think he'll be to rome
 as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
 by sovereignty of nature first he was
 a noble servant to them but he could not
 carry his honours even whether twas pride
 which out of daily fortune ever taints
 the happy man whether defect of judgment
 to fail in the disposing of those chances
 which he was lord of or whether nature
 not to be other than one thing not moving
 from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace
 even with the same austerity and garb
 as he controll'd the war but one of these
 as he hath spices of them all not all
 for i dare so far free himmade him fear'd
 so hated and so banish'd but he has a merit
 to choke it in the utterance so our virtues
 lie in the interpretation of the time
 and power unto itself most commendable
 hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
 to extol what it hath done
 one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
 rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
 come let's away when caius rome is thine
 thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine

scene i rome a public place
 enter menenius cominius sicinius brutus
 and others
menenius no i'll not go you hear what he hath said
 which was sometime his general who loved him
 in a most dear particular he call'd me father
 but what o that go you that banish'd him
 a mile before his tent fall down and knee
 the way into his mercy nay if he coy'd
 to hear cominius speak i'll keep at home
cominius he would not seem to know me
menenius do you hear
cominius yet one time he did call me by my name
 i urged our old acquaintance and the drops
 that we have bled together coriolanus
 he would not answer to forbad all names
 he was a kind of nothing titleless
 till he had forged himself a name o the fire
 of burning rome
menenius why so you have made good work
 a pair of tribunes that have rack'd for rome
 to make coals cheapa noble memory
cominius i minded him how royal twas to pardon
 when it was less expected he replied
 it was a bare petition of a state
 to one whom they had punish'd
menenius very well
 could he say less
cominius i offer'd to awaken his regard
 for's private friends his answer to me was
 he could not stay to pick them in a pile
 of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly
 for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
 and still to nose the offence
menenius for one poor grain or two
 i am one of those his mother wife his child
 and this brave fellow too we are the grains
 you are the musty chaff and you are smelt
 above the moon we must be burnt for you
sicinius nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid
 in this so neverneeded help yet do not
 upbraid's with our distress but sure if you
 would be your country's pleader your good tongue
 more than the instant army we can make
 might stop our countryman
menenius no i'll not meddle
sicinius pray you go to him
menenius what should i do
brutus only make trial what your love can do
 for rome towards marcius
menenius well and say that marcius
 return me as cominius is return'd
 unheard what then
 but as a discontented friend griefshot
 with his unkindness say't be so
sicinius yet your good will
 must have that thanks from rome after the measure
 as you intended well
menenius i'll undertake t
 i think he'll hear me yet to bite his lip
 and hum at good cominius much unhearts me
 he was not taken well he had not dined
 the veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then
 we pout upon the morning are unapt
 to give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd
 these and these conveyances of our blood
 with wine and feeding we have suppler souls
 than in our priestlike fasts therefore i'll watch him
 till he be dieted to my request
 and then i'll set upon him
brutus you know the very road into his kindness
 and cannot lose your way
menenius good faith i'll prove him
 speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge
 of my success
 exit
cominius he'll never hear him
sicinius not
cominius i tell you he does sit in gold his eye
 red as twould burn rome and his injury
 the gaoler to his pity i kneel'd before him
 twas very faintly he said rise dismiss'd me
 thus with his speechless hand what he would do
 he sent in writing after me what he would not
 bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
 so that all hope is vain
 unless his noble mother and his wife
 who as i hear mean to solicit him
 for mercy to his country therefore let's hence
 and with our fair entreaties haste them on

second senator you'll see your rome embraced with fire before

menenius good my friends
 if you have heard your general talk of rome
 and of his friends there it is lots to blanks
 my name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius
first senator be it so go back the virtue of your name
 is not here passable
menenius i tell thee fellow
 the general is my lover i have been
 the book of his good acts whence men have read
 his name unparallel'd haply amplified
 for i have ever verified my friends
 of whom he's chief with all the size that verity
 would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes
 like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
 i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
 have almost stamp'd the leasing therefore fellow
 i must have leave to pass
first senator faith sir if you had told as many lies in his
 behalf as you have uttered words in your own you
 should not pass here no though it were as virtuous
 to lie as to live chastely therefore go back
menenius prithee fellow remember my name is menenius
 always factionary on the party of your general
second senator howsoever you have been his liar as you say you
 have i am one that telling true under him must
 say you cannot pass therefore go back
menenius has he dined canst thou tell for i would not
 speak with him till after dinner
first senator you are a roman are you
menenius i am as thy general is
first senator then you should hate rome as he does can you
 when you have pushed out your gates the very
 defender of them and in a violent popular
 ignorance given your enemy your shield think to
 front his revenges with the easy groans of old
 women the virginal palms of your daughters or with
 the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
 you seem to be can you think to blow out the
 intended fire your city is ready to flame in with
 such weak breath as this no you are deceived
 therefore back to rome and prepare for your
 execution you are condemned our general has sworn
 you out of reprieve and pardon
menenius sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would
 use me with estimation
second senator come my captain knows you not

 with him if thou standest not i the state of
 hanging or of some death more long in
 spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now

 the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
 particular prosperity and love thee no worse than
 thy old father menenius does o my son my son
 thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's
 water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to
 thee but being assured none but myself could move
 thee i have been blown out of your gates with
 sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy
 petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy
 wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet

 access to thee

coriolanus we will before the walls of rome tomorrow
 set down our host my partner in this action
 you must report to the volscian lords how plainly
 i have borne this business
aufidius only their ends
 you have respected stopp'd your ears against
 the general suit of rome never admitted
 a private whisper no not with such friends
 that thought them sure of you
coriolanus this last old man
 whom with a crack'd heart i have sent to rome
 loved me above the measure of a father
 nay godded me indeed their latest refuge
 was to send him for whose old love i have
 though i show'd sourly to him once more offer'd
 the first conditions which they did refuse
 and cannot now accept to grace him only
 that thought he could do more a very little
 i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits
 nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
 will i lend ear to ha what shout is this
 shout within
 shall i be tempted to infringe my vow
 in the same time tis made i will not
 enter in mourning habits virgilia volumnia
 leading young marcius valeria and attendants
 my wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould
 wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand
 the grandchild to her blood but out affection
 all bond and privilege of nature break
 let it be virtuous to be obstinate
 what is that curt'sy worth or those doves eyes
 which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not
 of stronger earth than others my mother bows
 as if olympus to a molehill should
 in supplication nod and my young boy
 hath an aspect of intercession which
 great nature cries deny not let the volsces
 plough rome and harrow italy i'll never
 be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
 as if a man were author of himself
 and knew no other kin
virgilia my lord and husband
coriolanus these eyes are not the same i wore in rome
virgilia the sorrow that delivers us thus changed
 makes you think so
coriolanus like a dull actor now
 i have forgot my part and i am out
 even to a full disgrace best of my flesh
 forgive my tyranny but do not say
 for that forgive our romans o a kiss
 long as my exile sweet as my revenge
 now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
 i carried from thee dear and my true lip
 hath virgin'd it e'er since you gods i prate
 and the most noble mother of the world
 leave unsaluted sink my knee i the earth
 kneels
 of thy deep duty more impression show
 than that of common sons
volumnia o stand up blest
 whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
 i kneel before thee and unproperly
 show duty as mistaken all this while
 between the child and parent
 kneels
coriolanus what is this
 your knees to me to your corrected son
 then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
 fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
 strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun
 murdering impossibility to make
 what cannot be slight work
volumnia thou art my warrior
 i holp to frame thee do you know this lady
coriolanus the noble sister of publicola
 the moon of rome chaste as the icicle
 that's curdied by the frost from purest snow
 and hangs on dian's temple dear valeria
volumnia this is a poor epitome of yours
 which by the interpretation of full time
 may show like all yourself
coriolanus the god of soldiers
 with the consent of supreme jove inform
 thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
 to shame unvulnerable and stick i the wars
 like a great seamark standing every flaw
 and saving those that eye thee
volumnia your knee sirrah
coriolanus that's my brave boy
volumnia even he your wife this lady and myself
 are suitors to you
coriolanus i beseech you peace
 or if you'ld ask remember this before
 the thing i have forsworn to grant may never
 be held by you denials do not bid me
 dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
 again with rome's mechanics tell me not
 wherein i seem unnatural desire not
 to ally my rages and revenges with
 your colder reasons
volumnia o no more no more
 you have said you will not grant us any thing
 for we have nothing else to ask but that
 which you deny already yet we will ask
 that if you fail in our request the blame
 may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us
coriolanus aufidius and you volsces mark for we'll
 hear nought from rome in private your request
volumnia should we be silent and not speak our raiment
 and state of bodies would bewray what life
 we have led since thy exile think with thyself
 how more unfortunate than all living women
 are we come hither since that thy sight
 which should
 make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance
 with comforts
 constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
 making the mother wife and child to see
 the son the husband and the father tearing
 his country's bowels out and to poor we
 thine enmity's most capital thou barr'st us
 our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
 that all but we enjoy for how can we
 alas how can we for our country pray
 whereto we are bound together with thy victory
 whereto we are bound alack or we must lose
 the country our dear nurse or else thy person
 our comfort in the country we must find
 an evident calamity though we had
 our wish which side should win for either thou
 must as a foreign recreant be led
 with manacles thorough our streets or else
 triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin
 and bear the palm for having bravely shed
 thy wife and children's blood for myself son
 i purpose not to wait on fortune till
 these wars determine if i cannot persuade thee
 rather to show a noble grace to both parts
 than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
 march to assault thy country than to tread
 trust to't thou shalt noton thy mother's womb
 that brought thee to this world
virgilia ay and mine
 that brought you forth this boy to keep your name
 living to time
young marcius a shall not tread on me
 i'll run away till i am bigger but then i'll fight
coriolanus not of a woman's tenderness to be
 requires nor child nor woman's face to see
 i have sat too long
 rising
volumnia nay go not from us thus
 if it were so that our request did tend
 to save the romans thereby to destroy
 the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
 as poisonous of your honour no our suit
 is that you reconcile them while the volsces
 may say this mercy we have show'd the romans
 this we received and each in either side
 give the allhail to thee and cry be blest
 for making up this peace thou know'st great son
 the end of war's uncertain but this certain
 that if thou conquer rome the benefit
 which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
 whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses
 whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble
 but with his last attempt he wiped it out
 destroy'd his country and his name remains
 to the ensuing age abhorr'd speak to me son
 thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
 to imitate the graces of the gods
 to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air
 and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
 that should but rive an oak why dost not speak
 think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
 still to remember wrongs daughter speak you
 he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy
 perhaps thy childishness will move him more
 than can our reasons there's no man in the world
 more bound to s mother yet here he lets me prate
 like one i the stocks thou hast never in thy life
 show'd thy dear mother any courtesy
 when she poor hen fond of no second brood
 has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home
 loaden with honour say my request's unjust
 and spurn me back but if it be not so
 thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
 that thou restrain'st from me the duty which
 to a mother's part belongs he turns away
 down ladies let us shame him with our knees
 to his surname coriolanus longs more pride
 than pity to our prayers down an end
 this is the last so we will home to rome
 and die among our neighbours nay behold s
 this boy that cannot tell what he would have
 but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship
 does reason our petition with more strength
 than thou hast to deny t come let us go
 this fellow had a volscian to his mother
 his wife is in corioli and his child
 like him by chance yet give us our dispatch
 i am hush'd until our city be afire
 and then i'll speak a little
 he holds her by the hand silent
coriolanus o mother mother
 what have you done behold the heavens do ope
 the gods look down and this unnatural scene
 they laugh at o my mother mother o
 you have won a happy victory to rome
 but for your sonbelieve it o believe it
 most dangerously you have with him prevail'd
 if not most mortal to him but let it come
 aufidius though i cannot make true wars
 i'll frame convenient peace now good aufidius
 were you in my stead would you have heard
 a mother less or granted less aufidius
aufidius i was moved withal
coriolanus i dare be sworn you were
 and sir it is no little thing to make
 mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir
 what peace you'll make advise me for my part
 i'll not to rome i'll back with you and pray you
 stand to me in this cause o mother wife
aufidius aside i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
 thy honour
 at difference in thee out of that i'll work
 myself a former fortune
 the ladies make signs to coriolanus
coriolanus ay by and by

 sentenced and stay upon execution
sicinius is't possible that so short a time can alter the
 condition of a man
menenius there is differency between a grub and a butterfly

 from man to dragon he has wings he's more than a
 creeping thing
sicinius he loved his mother dearly
menenius so did he me and he no more remembers his mother
 now than an eightyearold horse the tartness
 of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he
 moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before
 his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with
 his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a
 battery he sits in his state as a thing made for
 alexander what he bids be done is finished with
 his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity
 and a heaven to throne in
sicinius yes mercy if you report him truly
menenius i paint him in the character mark what mercy his
 mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy
 in him than there is milk in a male tiger that

 enter three or four conspirators of aufidius faction
 most welcome
first conspirator how is it with our general
aufidius even so
 as with a man by his own alms empoison'd
 and with his charity slain
second conspirator most noble sir
 if you do hold the same intent wherein
 you wish'd us parties we'll deliver you
 of your great danger
aufidius sir i cannot tell
 we must proceed as we do find the people
third conspirator the people will remain uncertain whilst
 twixt you there's difference but the fall of either
 makes the survivor heir of all
aufidius i know it
 and my pretext to strike at him admits
 a good construction i raised him and i pawn'd
 mine honour for his truth who being so heighten'd
 he water'd his new plants with dews of flattery
 seducing so my friends and to this end
 he bow'd his nature never known before
 but to be rough unswayable and free
third conspirator sir his stoutness
 when he did stand for consul which he lost
 by lack of stooping
aufidius that i would have spoke of
 being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth
 presented to my knife his throat i took him
 made him jointservant with me gave him way
 in all his own desires nay let him choose
 out of my files his projects to accomplish
 my best and freshest men served his designments
 in mine own person holp to reap the fame
 which he did end all his and took some pride
 to do myself this wrong till at the last
 i seem'd his follower not partner and
 he waged me with his countenance as if
 i had been mercenary
first conspirator so he did my lord
 the army marvell'd at it and in the last
 when he had carried rome and that we look'd
 for no less spoil than glory
aufidius there was it
 for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him
 at a few drops of women's rheum which are
 as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
 of our great action therefore shall he die
 and i'll renew me in his fall but hark
 drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of
 the people
first conspirator your native town you enter'd like a post
 and had no welcomes home but he returns
 splitting the air with noise
second conspirator and patient fools
 whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
 with giving him glory
third conspirator therefore at your vantage
 ere he express himself or move the people
 with what he would say let him feel your sword
 which we will second when he lies along
 after your way his tale pronounced shall bury
 his reasons with his body
aufidius say no more
 here come the lords
 enter the lords of the city
all the lords you are most welcome home
aufidius i have not deserved it
 but worthy lords have you with heed perused
 what i have written to you
lords we have
first lord and grieve to hear't
 what faults he made before the last i think
 might have found easy fines but there to end
 where he was to begin and give away
 the benefit of our levies answering us
 with our own charge making a treaty where
 there was a yieldingthis admits no excuse
aufidius he approaches you shall hear him
 enter coriolanus marching with drum and
 colours commoners being with him
coriolanus hail lords i am return'd your soldier

 than when i parted hence but still subsisting
 under your great command you are to know
 that prosperously i have attempted and
 with bloody passage led your wars even to
 the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home
 do more than counterpoise a full third part
 the charges of the action we have made peace
 with no less honour to the antiates
 than shame to the romans and we here deliver
 subscribed by the consuls and patricians
 together with the seal o the senate what
 we have compounded on

 exit
marcellus holla bernardo
bernardo say
 what is horatio there
horatio a piece of him
bernardo welcome horatio welcome good marcellus
marcellus what has this thing appear'd again tonight
bernardo i have seen nothing
marcellus horatio says tis but our fantasy
 and will not let belief take hold of him
 touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
 therefore i have entreated him along
 with us to watch the minutes of this night
 that if again this apparition come
 he may approve our eyes and speak to it
horatio tush tush twill not appear
bernardo sit down awhile
 and let us once again assail your ears
 that are so fortified against our story
 what we have two nights seen
horatio well sit we down
 and let us hear bernardo speak of this
bernardo last night of all
 when yond same star that's westward from the pole
 had made his course to illume that part of heaven
 where now it burns marcellus and myself
 the bell then beating one
 enter ghost
marcellus peace break thee off look where it comes again
bernardo in the same figure like the king that's dead
marcellus thou art a scholar speak to it horatio
bernardo looks it not like the king mark it horatio
horatio most like it harrows me with fear and wonder
bernardo it would be spoke to
marcellus question it horatio
horatio what art thou that usurp'st this time of night
 together with that fair and warlike form
 in which the majesty of buried denmark
 did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak
marcellus it is offended
bernardo see it stalks away
horatio stay speak speak i charge thee speak
 exit ghost
marcellus tis gone and will not answer
bernardo how now horatio you tremble and look pale
 is not this something more than fantasy
 what think you on't
horatio before my god i might not this believe
 without the sensible and true avouch
 of mine own eyes
marcellus is it not like the king
horatio as thou art to thyself
 such was the very armour he had on
 when he the ambitious norway combated
 so frown'd he once when in an angry parle
 he smote the sledded polacks on the ice
 tis strange
marcellus thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
 with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
horatio in what particular thought to work i know not
 but in the gross and scope of my opinion
 this bodes some strange eruption to our state
marcellus good now sit down and tell me he that knows
 why this same strict and most observant watch
 so nightly toils the subject of the land
 and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
 and foreign mart for implements of war
 why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
 does not divide the sunday from the week
 what might be toward that this sweaty haste
 doth make the night jointlabourer with the day
 who is't that can inform me
horatio that can i
 at least the whisper goes so our last king
 whose image even but now appear'd to us
 was as you know by fortinbras of norway
 thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride
 dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet
 for so this side of our known world esteem'd him
 did slay this fortinbras who by a seal'd compact
 well ratified by law and heraldry
 did forfeit with his life all those his lands
 which he stood seized of to the conqueror
 against the which a moiety competent
 was gaged by our king which had return'd
 to the inheritance of fortinbras
 had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant
 and carriage of the article design'd
 his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras
 of unimproved mettle hot and full
 hath in the skirts of norway here and there
 shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes
 for food and diet to some enterprise
 that hath a stomach in't which is no other
 as it doth well appear unto our state
 but to recover of us by strong hand
 and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
 so by his father lost and this i take it
 is the main motive of our preparations
 the source of this our watch and the chief head
 of this posthaste and romage in the land
bernardo i think it be no other but e'en so
 well may it sort that this portentous figure
 comes armed through our watch so like the king
 that was and is the question of these wars
horatio a mote it is to trouble the mind's eye
 in the most high and palmy state of rome
 a little ere the mightiest julius fell
 the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
 did squeak and gibber in the roman streets
 as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
 disasters in the sun and the moist star
 upon whose influence neptune's empire stands
 was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
 and even the like precurse of fierce events
 as harbingers preceding still the fates
 and prologue to the omen coming on
 have heaven and earth together demonstrated
 unto our climatures and countrymen
 but soft behold lo where it comes again
 reenter ghost
 i'll cross it though it blast me stay illusion
 if thou hast any sound or use of voice
 speak to me
 if there be any good thing to be done
 that may to thee do ease and grace to me
 speak to me
 cock crows
 if thou art privy to thy country's fate
 which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak
 or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
 extorted treasure in the womb of earth
 for which they say you spirits oft walk in death
 speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus
marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan
horatio do if it will not stand
bernardo tis here
horatio tis here
marcellus tis gone
 exit ghost
 we do it wrong being so majestical
 to offer it the show of violence
 for it is as the air invulnerable
 and our vain blows malicious mockery
bernardo it was about to speak when the cock crew
horatio and then it started like a guilty thing
 upon a fearful summons i have heard
 the cock that is the trumpet to the morn
 doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
 awake the god of day and at his warning
 whether in sea or fire in earth or air
 the extravagant and erring spirit hies
 to his confine and of the truth herein
 this present object made probation
marcellus it faded on the crowing of the cock
 some say that ever gainst that season comes
 wherein our saviour's birth is celebrated
 the bird of dawning singeth all night long
 and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
 the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
 no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
 so hallow'd and so gracious is the time
horatio so have i heard and do in part believe it
 but look the morn in russet mantle clad
 walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill
 break we our watch up and by my advice
 let us impart what we have seen tonight
 unto young hamlet for upon my life
 this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
 do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
 as needful in our loves fitting our duty
marcellus let's do't i pray and i this morning know
 where we shall find him most conveniently

 enter king claudius queen gertrude hamlet
 polonius laertes voltimand cornelius lords
 and attendants
king claudius though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death
 the memory be green and that it us befitted
 to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
 to be contracted in one brow of woe
 yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
 that we with wisest sorrow think on him
 together with remembrance of ourselves
 therefore our sometime sister now our queen
 the imperial jointress to this warlike state
 have we as twere with a defeated joy
 with an auspicious and a dropping eye
 with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
 in equal scale weighing delight and dole
 taken to wife nor have we herein barr'd
 your better wisdoms which have freely gone
 with this affair along for all our thanks
 now follows that you know young fortinbras
 holding a weak supposal of our worth
 or thinking by our late dear brother's death
 our state to be disjoint and out of frame
 colleagued with the dream of his advantage
 he hath not fail'd to pester us with message
 importing the surrender of those lands
 lost by his father with all bonds of law
 to our most valiant brother so much for him
 now for ourself and for this time of meeting
 thus much the business is we have here writ
 to norway uncle of young fortinbras
 who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
 of this his nephew's purposeto suppress
 his further gait herein in that the levies
 the lists and full proportions are all made
 out of his subject and we here dispatch
 you good cornelius and you voltimand
 for bearers of this greeting to old norway
 giving to you no further personal power
 to business with the king more than the scope
 of these delated articles allow
 farewell and let your haste commend your duty
cornelius 
 in that and all things will we show our duty
voltimand 
king claudius we doubt it nothing heartily farewell
 exeunt voltimand and cornelius
 and now laertes what's the news with you
 you told us of some suit what is't laertes
 you cannot speak of reason to the dane
 and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes
 that shall not be my offer not thy asking
 the head is not more native to the heart
 the hand more instrumental to the mouth
 than is the throne of denmark to thy father
 what wouldst thou have laertes
laertes my dread lord
 your leave and favour to return to france
 from whence though willingly i came to denmark
 to show my duty in your coronation
 yet now i must confess that duty done
 my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
 and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
king claudius have you your father's leave what says polonius
lord polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
 by laboursome petition and at last
 upon his will i seal'd my hard consent
 i do beseech you give him leave to go
king claudius take thy fair hour laertes time be thine
 and thy best graces spend it at thy will
 but now my cousin hamlet and my son
hamlet aside a little more than kin and less than kind
king claudius how is it that the clouds still hang on you
hamlet not so my lord i am too much i the sun
queen gertrude good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
 and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
 do not for ever with thy vailed lids
 seek for thy noble father in the dust
 thou know'st tis common all that lives must die
 passing through nature to eternity
hamlet ay madam it is common
queen gertrude if it be
 why seems it so particular with thee
hamlet seems madam nay it is i know not seems'
 tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
 nor customary suits of solemn black
 nor windy suspiration of forced breath
 no nor the fruitful river in the eye
 nor the dejected havior of the visage
 together with all forms moods shapes of grief
 that can denote me truly these indeed seem
 for they are actions that a man might play
 but i have that within which passeth show
 these but the trappings and the suits of woe
king claudius tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet
 to give these mourning duties to your father
 but you must know your father lost a father
 that father lost lost his and the survivor bound
 in filial obligation for some term
 to do obsequious sorrow but to persever
 in obstinate condolement is a course
 of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief
 it shows a will most incorrect to heaven
 a heart unfortified a mind impatient
 an understanding simple and unschool'd
 for what we know must be and is as common
 as any the most vulgar thing to sense
 why should we in our peevish opposition
 take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven
 a fault against the dead a fault to nature
 to reason most absurd whose common theme
 is death of fathers and who still hath cried
 from the first corse till he that died today
 this must be so we pray you throw to earth
 this unprevailing woe and think of us
 as of a father for let the world take note
 you are the most immediate to our throne
 and with no less nobility of love
 than that which dearest father bears his son
 do i impart toward you for your intent
 in going back to school in wittenberg
 it is most retrograde to our desire
 and we beseech you bend you to remain
 here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
 our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
queen gertrude let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
 i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg
hamlet i shall in all my best obey you madam
king claudius why tis a loving and a fair reply
 be as ourself in denmark madam come
 this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet
 sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
 no jocund health that denmark drinks today
 but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
 and the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again
 respeaking earthly thunder come away
 exeunt all but hamlet
hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt
 thaw and resolve itself into a dew
 or that the everlasting had not fix'd
 his canon gainst selfslaughter o god god
 how weary stale flat and unprofitable
 seem to me all the uses of this world
 fie on't ah fie tis an unweeded garden
 that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
 possess it merely that it should come to this
 but two months dead nay not so much not two
 so excellent a king that was to this
 hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
 that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
 visit her face too roughly heaven and earth
 must i remember why she would hang on him
 as if increase of appetite had grown
 by what it fed on and yet within a month
 let me not think on'tfrailty thy name is woman
 a little month or ere those shoes were old
 with which she follow'd my poor father's body
 like niobe all tearswhy she even she
 o god a beast that wants discourse of reason
 would have mourn'd longermarried with my uncle
 my father's brother but no more like my father
 than i to hercules within a month
 ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
 had left the flushing in her galled eyes
 she married o most wicked speed to post
 with such dexterity to incestuous sheets
 it is not nor it cannot come to good
 but break my heart for i must hold my tongue
 enter horatio marcellus and bernardo
horatio hail to your lordship
hamlet i am glad to see you well
 horatioor i do forget myself
horatio the same my lord and your poor servant ever
hamlet sir my good friend i'll change that name with you
 and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus
marcellus my good lord
hamlet i am very glad to see you good even sir
 but what in faith make you from wittenberg
horatio a truant disposition good my lord
hamlet i would not hear your enemy say so
 nor shall you do mine ear that violence
 to make it truster of your own report
 against yourself i know you are no truant
 but what is your affair in elsinore
 we'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart
horatio my lord i came to see your father's funeral
hamlet i pray thee do not mock me fellowstudent
 i think it was to see my mother's wedding
horatio indeed my lord it follow'd hard upon
hamlet thrift thrift horatio the funeral baked meats
 did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
 would i had met my dearest foe in heaven
 or ever i had seen that day horatio
 my fathermethinks i see my father
horatio where my lord
hamlet in my mind's eye horatio
horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king
hamlet he was a man take him for all in all
 i shall not look upon his like again
horatio my lord i think i saw him yesternight
hamlet saw who
horatio my lord the king your father
hamlet the king my father
horatio season your admiration for awhile
 with an attent ear till i may deliver
 upon the witness of these gentlemen
 this marvel to you
hamlet for god's love let me hear
horatio two nights together had these gentlemen
 marcellus and bernardo on their watch
 in the dead vast and middle of the night
 been thus encounter'd a figure like your father
 armed at point exactly capape
 appears before them and with solemn march
 goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk'd
 by their oppress'd and fearsurprised eyes
 within his truncheon's length whilst they distilled
 almost to jelly with the act of fear
 stand dumb and speak not to him this to me
 in dreadful secrecy impart they did
 and i with them the third night kept the watch
 where as they had deliver'd both in time
 form of the thing each word made true and good
 the apparition comes i knew your father
 these hands are not more like
hamlet but where was this
marcellus my lord upon the platform where we watch'd
hamlet did you not speak to it
horatio my lord i did
 but answer made it none yet once methought
 it lifted up its head and did address
 itself to motion like as it would speak
 but even then the morning cock crew loud
 and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
 and vanish'd from our sight
hamlet tis very strange
horatio as i do live my honour'd lord tis true
 and we did think it writ down in our duty
 to let you know of it
hamlet indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
 hold you the watch tonight
marcellus 
 we do my lord
bernardo 
hamlet arm'd say you
marcellus 
 arm'd my lord
bernardo 
hamlet from top to toe
marcellus 
 my lord from head to foot
bernardo 
hamlet then saw you not his face
horatio o yes my lord he wore his beaver up
hamlet what look'd he frowningly
horatio a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
hamlet pale or red
horatio nay very pale
hamlet and fix'd his eyes upon you
horatio most constantly
hamlet i would i had been there
horatio it would have much amazed you
hamlet very like very like stay'd it long
horatio while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
marcellus 
 longer longer
bernardo 
horatio not when i saw't
hamlet his beard was grizzledno
horatio it was as i have seen it in his life
 a sable silver'd
hamlet i will watch tonight
 perchance twill walk again
horatio i warrant it will
hamlet if it assume my noble father's person
 i'll speak to it though hell itself should gape
 and bid me hold my peace i pray you all
 if you have hitherto conceal'd this sight
 let it be tenable in your silence still
 and whatsoever else shall hap tonight
 give it an understanding but no tongue
 i will requite your loves so fare you well
 upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve
 i'll visit you
all our duty to your honour
hamlet your loves as mine to you farewell
 exeunt all but hamlet
 my father's spirit in arms all is not well
 i doubt some foul play would the night were come
 till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
 though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes

act i
scene iii a room in polonius house
 enter laertes and ophelia
laertes my necessaries are embark'd farewell
 and sister as the winds give benefit
 and convoy is assistant do not sleep
 but let me hear from you
ophelia do you doubt that
laertes for hamlet and the trifling of his favour
 hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
 a violet in the youth of primy nature
 forward not permanent sweet not lasting
 the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more
ophelia no more but so
laertes think it no more
 for nature crescent does not grow alone
 in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
 the inward service of the mind and soul
 grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now
 and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
 the virtue of his will but you must fear
 his greatness weigh'd his will is not his own
 for he himself is subject to his birth
 he may not as unvalued persons do
 carve for himself for on his choice depends
 the safety and health of this whole state
 and therefore must his choice be circumscribed
 unto the voice and yielding of that body
 whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you
 it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
 as he in his particular act and place
 may give his saying deed which is no further
 than the main voice of denmark goes withal
 then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
 if with too credent ear you list his songs
 or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
 to his unmaster'd importunity
 fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister
 and keep you in the rear of your affection
 out of the shot and danger of desire
 the chariest maid is prodigal enough
 if she unmask her beauty to the moon
 virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes
 the canker galls the infants of the spring
 too oft before their buttons be disclosed
 and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
 contagious blastments are most imminent
 be wary then best safety lies in fear
 youth to itself rebels though none else near
ophelia i shall the effect of this good lesson keep
 as watchman to my heart but good my brother
 do not as some ungracious pastors do
 show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
 whiles like a puff'd and reckless libertine
 himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
 and recks not his own rede
laertes o fear me not
 i stay too long but here my father comes
 enter polonius
 a double blessing is a double grace
 occasion smiles upon a second leave
lord polonius yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame
 the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
 and you are stay'd for there my blessing with thee
 and these few precepts in thy memory
 see thou character give thy thoughts no tongue
 nor any unproportioned thought his act
 be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
 those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
 grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
 but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
 of each newhatch'd unfledged comrade beware
 of entrance to a quarrel but being in
 bear't that the opposed may beware of thee
 give every man thy ear but few thy voice
 take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment
 costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
 but not express'd in fancy rich not gaudy
 for the apparel oft proclaims the man
 and they in france of the best rank and station
 are of a most select and generous chief in that
 neither a borrower nor a lender be
 for loan oft loses both itself and friend
 and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
 this above all to thine ownself be true
 and it must follow as the night the day
 thou canst not then be false to any man
 farewell my blessing season this in thee
laertes most humbly do i take my leave my lord
lord polonius the time invites you go your servants tend
laertes farewell ophelia and remember well
 what i have said to you
ophelia tis in my memory lock'd
 and you yourself shall keep the key of it
laertes farewell
 exit
lord polonius what is't ophelia be hath said to you
ophelia so please you something touching the lord hamlet
lord polonius marry well bethought
 tis told me he hath very oft of late
 given private time to you and you yourself
 have of your audience been most free and bounteous
 if it be so as so tis put on me
 and that in way of caution i must tell you
 you do not understand yourself so clearly
 as it behoves my daughter and your honour
 what is between you give me up the truth
ophelia he hath my lord of late made many tenders
 of his affection to me
lord polonius affection pooh you speak like a green girl
 unsifted in such perilous circumstance
 do you believe his tenders as you call them
ophelia i do not know my lord what i should think
lord polonius marry i'll teach you think yourself a baby
 that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay
 which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly
 ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase
 running it thusyou'll tender me a fool
ophelia my lord he hath importuned me with love
 in honourable fashion
lord polonius ay fashion you may call it go to go to
ophelia and hath given countenance to his speech my lord
 with almost all the holy vows of heaven
lord polonius ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know
 when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
 lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
 giving more light than heat extinct in both
 even in their promise as it is amaking
 you must not take for fire from this time
 be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence
 set your entreatments at a higher rate
 than a command to parley for lord hamlet
 believe so much in him that he is young
 and with a larger tether may he walk
 than may be given you in few ophelia
 do not believe his vows for they are brokers
 not of that dye which their investments show
 but mere implorators of unholy suits
 breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
 the better to beguile this is for all
 i would not in plain terms from this time forth
 have you so slander any moment leisure
 as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
 look to't i charge you come your ways
ophelia i shall obey my lord

act i
scene iv the platform
 enter hamlet horatio and marcellus
hamlet the air bites shrewdly it is very cold
horatio it is a nipping and an eager air
hamlet what hour now
horatio i think it lacks of twelve
hamlet no it is struck
horatio indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season
 wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
 a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within
 what does this mean my lord
hamlet the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
 keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels
 and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down
 the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
 the triumph of his pledge
horatio is it a custom
hamlet ay marry is't
 but to my mind though i am native here
 and to the manner born it is a custom
 more honour'd in the breach than the observance
 this heavyheaded revel east and west
 makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations
 they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
 soil our addition and indeed it takes
 from our achievements though perform'd at height
 the pith and marrow of our attribute
 so oft it chances in particular men
 that for some vicious mole of nature in them
 as in their birthwherein they are not guilty
 since nature cannot choose his origin
 by the o'ergrowth of some complexion
 oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
 or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
 the form of plausive manners that these men
 carrying i say the stamp of one defect
 being nature's livery or fortune's star
 their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace
 as infinite as man may undergo
 shall in the general censure take corruption
 from that particular fault the dram of eale
 doth all the noble substance of a doubt
 to his own scandal
horatio look my lord it comes
 enter ghost
hamlet angels and ministers of grace defend us
 be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd
 bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
 be thy intents wicked or charitable
 thou comest in such a questionable shape
 that i will speak to thee i'll call thee hamlet
 king father royal dane o answer me
 let me not burst in ignorance but tell
 why thy canonized bones hearsed in death
 have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
 wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd
 hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
 to cast thee up again what may this mean
 that thou dead corse again in complete steel
 revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon
 making night hideous and we fools of nature
 so horridly to shake our disposition
 with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
 say why is this wherefore what should we do
 ghost beckons hamlet
horatio it beckons you to go away with it
 as if it some impartment did desire
 to you alone
marcellus look with what courteous action
 it waves you to a more removed ground
 but do not go with it
horatio no by no means
hamlet it will not speak then i will follow it
horatio do not my lord
hamlet why what should be the fear
 i do not set my life in a pin's fee
 and for my soul what can it do to that
 being a thing immortal as itself
 it waves me forth again i'll follow it
horatio what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
 or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
 that beetles o'er his base into the sea
 and there assume some other horrible form
 which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
 and draw you into madness think of it
 the very place puts toys of desperation
 without more motive into every brain
 that looks so many fathoms to the sea
 and hears it roar beneath
hamlet it waves me still
 go on i'll follow thee

scene v another part of the platform
 enter ghost and hamlet
hamlet where wilt thou lead me speak i'll go no further
ghost mark me
hamlet i will
ghost my hour is almost come
 when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames
 must render up myself
hamlet alas poor ghost
ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
 to what i shall unfold
hamlet speak i am bound to hear
ghost so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
hamlet what
ghost i am thy father's spirit
 doom'd for a certain term to walk the night
 and for the day confined to fast in fires
 till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
 are burnt and purged away but that i am forbid
 to tell the secrets of my prisonhouse
 i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
 would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
 make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
 thy knotted and combined locks to part
 and each particular hair to stand on end
 like quills upon the fretful porpentine
 but this eternal blazon must not be
 to ears of flesh and blood list list o list
 if thou didst ever thy dear father love
hamlet o god
ghost revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
hamlet murder
ghost murder most foul as in the best it is
 but this most foul strange and unnatural
hamlet haste me to know't that i with wings as swift
 as meditation or the thoughts of love
 may sweep to my revenge
ghost i find thee apt
 and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
 that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf
 wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear
 tis given out that sleeping in my orchard
 a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark
 is by a forged process of my death
 rankly abused but know thou noble youth
 the serpent that did sting thy father's life
 now wears his crown
hamlet o my prophetic soul my uncle
ghost ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
 with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts
 o wicked wit and gifts that have the power
 so to seducewon to his shameful lust
 the will of my most seemingvirtuous queen
 o hamlet what a fallingoff was there
 from me whose love was of that dignity
 that it went hand in hand even with the vow
 i made to her in marriage and to decline
 upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
 to those of mine
 but virtue as it never will be moved
 though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
 so lust though to a radiant angel link'd
 will sate itself in a celestial bed
 and prey on garbage
 but soft methinks i scent the morning air
 brief let me be sleeping within my orchard
 my custom always of the afternoon
 upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
 with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial
 and in the porches of my ears did pour
 the leperous distilment whose effect
 holds such an enmity with blood of man
 that swift as quicksilver it courses through
 the natural gates and alleys of the body
 and with a sudden vigour doth posset
 and curd like eager droppings into milk
 the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
 and a most instant tetter bark'd about
 most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
 all my smooth body
 thus was i sleeping by a brother's hand
 of life of crown of queen at once dispatch'd
 cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
 unhousel'd disappointed unanel'd
 no reckoning made but sent to my account
 with all my imperfections on my head
 o horrible o horrible most horrible
 if thou hast nature in thee bear it not
 let not the royal bed of denmark be
 a couch for luxury and damned incest
 but howsoever thou pursuest this act
 taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
 against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
 and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
 to prick and sting her fare thee well at once
 the glowworm shows the matin to be near
 and gins to pale his uneffectual fire
 adieu adieu hamlet remember me
 exit
hamlet o all you host of heaven o earth what else
 and shall i couple hell o fie hold hold my heart
 and you my sinews grow not instant old
 but bear me stiffly up remember thee
 ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
 in this distracted globe remember thee
 yea from the table of my memory
 i'll wipe away all trivial fond records
 all saws of books all forms all pressures past
 that youth and observation copied there
 and thy commandment all alone shall live
 within the book and volume of my brain
 unmix'd with baser matter yes by heaven
 o most pernicious woman
 o villain villain smiling damned villain
 my tablesmeet it is i set it down
 that one may smile and smile and be a villain
 at least i'm sure it may be so in denmark
 writing
 so uncle there you are now to my word
 it is adieu adieu remember me'

 here as before never so help you mercy
 how strange or odd soe'er i bear myself
 as i perchance hereafter shall think meet
 to put an antic disposition on
 that you at such times seeing me never shall
 with arms encumber'd thus or this headshake
 or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
 as well well we know or we could an if we would'
 or if we list to speak or there be an if they might'

act ii
scene i a room in polonius house
 enter polonius and reynaldo
lord polonius give him this money and these notes reynaldo
reynaldo i will my lord
lord polonius you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo
 before you visit him to make inquire
 of his behavior
reynaldo my lord i did intend it
lord polonius marry well said very well said look you sir
 inquire me first what danskers are in paris
 and how and who what means and where they keep
 what company at what expense and finding
 by this encompassment and drift of question
 that they do know my son come you more nearer
 than your particular demands will touch it
 take you as twere some distant knowledge of him
 as thus i know his father and his friends
 and in part him  do you mark this reynaldo
reynaldo ay very well my lord
lord polonius and in part him but you may say not well
 but if't be he i mean he's very wild
 addicted so and so and there put on him
 what forgeries you please marry none so rank
 as may dishonour him take heed of that
 but sir such wanton wild and usual slips
 as are companions noted and most known
 to youth and liberty
reynaldo as gaming my lord
lord polonius ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
 drabbing you may go so far
reynaldo my lord that would dishonour him
lord polonius faith no as you may season it in the charge
 you must not put another scandal on him
 that he is open to incontinency
 that's not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
 that they may seem the taints of liberty
 the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
 a savageness in unreclaimed blood
 of general assault
reynaldo but my good lord
lord polonius wherefore should you do this
reynaldo ay my lord
 i would know that
lord polonius marry sir here's my drift
 and i believe it is a fetch of wit
 you laying these slight sullies on my son
 as twere a thing a little soil'd i the working mark you
 your party in converse him you would sound
 having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
 the youth you breathe of guilty be assured
 he closes with you in this consequence
 good sir or so or friend or gentleman'
 according to the phrase or the addition
 of man and country
reynaldo very good my lord
lord polonius and then sir does he thishe doeswhat was i
 about to say by the mass i was about to say
 something where did i leave
reynaldo at closes in the consequence at friend or so'
 and gentleman'
lord polonius at closes in the consequence ay marry
 he closes thus i know the gentleman
 i saw him yesterday or t other day
 or then or then with such or such and as you say
 there was a gaming there o'ertook in's rouse
 there falling out at tennis or perchance
 i saw him enter such a house of sale'
 videlicet a brothel or so forth
 see you now
 your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
 and thus do we of wisdom and of reach
 with windlasses and with assays of bias
 by indirections find directions out
 so by my former lecture and advice
 shall you my son you have me have you not
reynaldo my lord i have
lord polonius god be wi you fare you well
reynaldo good my lord
lord polonius observe his inclination in yourself
reynaldo i shall my lord
lord polonius and let him ply his music
reynaldo well my lord
lord polonius farewell
 exit reynaldo
 enter ophelia
 how now ophelia what's the matter
ophelia o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted
lord polonius with what i the name of god
ophelia my lord as i was sewing in my closet
 lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced
 no hat upon his head his stockings foul'd
 ungarter'd and downgyved to his ancle
 pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
 and with a look so piteous in purport
 as if he had been loosed out of hell
 to speak of horrorshe comes before me
lord polonius mad for thy love
ophelia my lord i do not know
 but truly i do fear it
lord polonius what said he
ophelia he took me by the wrist and held me hard
 then goes he to the length of all his arm
 and with his other hand thus o'er his brow
 he falls to such perusal of my face
 as he would draw it long stay'd he so
 at last a little shaking of mine arm
 and thrice his head thus waving up and down
 he raised a sigh so piteous and profound
 as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
 and end his being that done he lets me go
 and with his head over his shoulder turn'd
 he seem'd to find his way without his eyes
 for out o doors he went without their helps
 and to the last bended their light on me
lord polonius come go with me i will go seek the king
 this is the very ecstasy of love
 whose violent property fordoes itself
 and leads the will to desperate undertakings
 as oft as any passion under heaven
 that does afflict our natures i am sorry
 what have you given him any hard words of late
ophelia no my good lord but as you did command
 i did repel his fetters and denied
 his access to me
lord polonius that hath made him mad
 i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
 i had not quoted him i fear'd he did but trifle
 and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy
 by heaven it is as proper to our age
 to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
 as it is common for the younger sort
 to lack discretion come go we to the king
 this must be known which being kept close might
 move
 more grief to hide than hate to utter love

scene ii a room in the castle
 enter king claudius queen gertrude rosencrantz
 guildenstern and attendants
king claudius welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern
 moreover that we much did long to see you
 the need we have to use you did provoke
 our hasty sending something have you heard
 of hamlet's transformation so call it
 sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
 resembles that it was what it should be
 more than his father's death that thus hath put him
 so much from the understanding of himself
 i cannot dream of i entreat you both
 that being of so young days brought up with him
 and sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior
 that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
 some little time so by your companies
 to draw him on to pleasures and to gather
 so much as from occasion you may glean
 whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
 that open'd lies within our remedy
queen gertrude good gentlemen he hath much talk'd of you
 and sure i am two men there are not living
 to whom he more adheres if it will please you
 to show us so much gentry and good will
 as to expend your time with us awhile
 for the supply and profit of our hope
 your visitation shall receive such thanks
 as fits a king's remembrance
rosencrantz both your majesties
 might by the sovereign power you have of us
 put your dread pleasures more into command
 than to entreaty
guildenstern but we both obey
 and here give up ourselves in the full bent
 to lay our service freely at your feet
 to be commanded
king claudius thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern
queen gertrude thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz
 and i beseech you instantly to visit
 my too much changed son go some of you
 and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is
guildenstern heavens make our presence and our practises
 pleasant and helpful to him
queen gertrude ay amen

 attendants
 enter polonius
lord polonius the ambassadors from norway my good lord
 are joyfully return'd
king claudius thou still hast been the father of good news
lord polonius have i my lord i assure my good liege
 i hold my duty as i hold my soul
 both to my god and to my gracious king
 and i do think or else this brain of mine
 hunts not the trail of policy so sure
 as it hath used to do that i have found
 the very cause of hamlet's lunacy
king claudius o speak of that that do i long to hear
lord polonius give first admittance to the ambassadors
 my news shall be the fruit to that great feast
king claudius thyself do grace to them and bring them in
 exit polonius
 he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found
 the head and source of all your son's distemper
queen gertrude i doubt it is no other but the main
 his father's death and our o'erhasty marriage
king claudius well we shall sift him
 reenter polonius with voltimand and cornelius
 welcome my good friends
 say voltimand what from our brother norway
voltimand most fair return of greetings and desires
 upon our first he sent out to suppress
 his nephew's levies which to him appear'd
 to be a preparation gainst the polack
 but better look'd into he truly found
 it was against your highness whereat grieved
 that so his sickness age and impotence
 was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
 on fortinbras which he in brief obeys
 receives rebuke from norway and in fine
 makes vow before his uncle never more
 to give the assay of arms against your majesty
 whereon old norway overcome with joy
 gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
 and his commission to employ those soldiers
 so levied as before against the polack
 with an entreaty herein further shown
 giving a paper
 that it might please you to give quiet pass
 through your dominions for this enterprise
 on such regards of safety and allowance
 as therein are set down
king claudius it likes us well
 and at our more consider'd time well read
 answer and think upon this business
 meantime we thank you for your welltook labour
 go to your rest at night we'll feast together
 most welcome home
 exeunt voltimand and cornelius
lord polonius this business is well ended
 my liege and madam to expostulate
 what majesty should be what duty is
 why day is day night night and time is time
 were nothing but to waste night day and time
 therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
 and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
 i will be brief your noble son is mad
 mad call i it for to define true madness
 what is't but to be nothing else but mad
 but let that go
queen gertrude more matter with less art
lord polonius madam i swear i use no art at all
 that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity
 and pity tis tis true a foolish figure
 but farewell it for i will use no art
 mad let us grant him then and now remains
 that we find out the cause of this effect
 or rather say the cause of this defect
 for this effect defective comes by cause
 thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend
 i have a daughterhave while she is mine
 who in her duty and obedience mark
 hath given me this now gather and surmise
 reads
 to the celestial and my soul's idol the most
 beautified ophelia'
 that's an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is
 a vile phrase but you shall hear thus
 reads
 in her excellent white bosom these &c'
queen gertrude came this from hamlet to her
lord polonius good madam stay awhile i will be faithful
 reads
 doubt thou the stars are fire
 doubt that the sun doth move
 doubt truth to be a liar
 but never doubt i love
 o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers
 i have not art to reckon my groans but that
 i love thee best o most best believe it adieu
 thine evermore most dear lady whilst
 this machine is to him hamlet'
 this in obedience hath my daughter shown me
 and more above hath his solicitings
 as they fell out by time by means and place
 all given to mine ear
king claudius but how hath she
 received his love
lord polonius what do you think of me
king claudius as of a man faithful and honourable
lord polonius i would fain prove so but what might you think
 when i had seen this hot love on the wing
 as i perceived it i must tell you that
 before my daughter told mewhat might you
 or my dear majesty your queen here think
 if i had play'd the desk or tablebook
 or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
 or look'd upon this love with idle sight
 what might you think no i went round to work
 and my young mistress thus i did bespeak
 lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star
 this must not be and then i precepts gave her
 that she should lock herself from his resort
 admit no messengers receive no tokens
 which done she took the fruits of my advice
 and he repulseda short tale to make
 fell into a sadness then into a fast
 thence to a watch thence into a weakness
 thence to a lightness and by this declension
 into the madness wherein now he raves
 and all we mourn for
king claudius do you think tis this
queen gertrude it may be very likely
lord polonius hath there been such a timei'd fain know that
 that i have positively said tis so'
 when it proved otherwise
king claudius not that i know
lord polonius pointing to his head and shoulder
 take this from this if this be otherwise
 if circumstances lead me i will find
 where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
 within the centre
king claudius how may we try it further
lord polonius you know sometimes he walks four hours together
 here in the lobby
queen gertrude so he does indeed
lord polonius at such a time i'll loose my daughter to him
 be you and i behind an arras then
 mark the encounter if he love her not
 and be not from his reason fall'n thereon
 let me be no assistant for a state
 but keep a farm and carters
king claudius we will try it
queen gertrude but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
lord polonius away i do beseech you both away
 i'll board him presently
 exeunt king claudius queen gertrude and
 attendants
 enter hamlet reading
 o give me leave
 how does my good lord hamlet
hamlet well godamercy
lord polonius do you know me my lord
hamlet excellent well you are a fishmonger
lord polonius not i my lord
hamlet then i would you were so honest a man
lord polonius honest my lord
hamlet ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be
 one man picked out of ten thousand
lord polonius that's very true my lord
hamlet for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a
 god kissing carrionhave you a daughter
lord polonius i have my lord
hamlet let her not walk i the sun conception is a
 blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
 friend look to t
lord polonius aside how say you by that still harping on my
 daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i
 was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and
 truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for
 love very near this i'll speak to him again
 what do you read my lord
hamlet words words words
lord polonius what is the matter my lord
hamlet between who
lord polonius i mean the matter that you read my lord
hamlet slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here
 that old men have grey beards that their faces are
 wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and
 plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
 wit together with most weak hams all which sir
 though i most powerfully and potently believe yet
 i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for
 yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab
 you could go backward
lord polonius aside though this be madness yet there is method
 in t will you walk out of the air my lord
hamlet into my grave
lord polonius indeed that is out o the air
 aside
 how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness
 that often madness hits on which reason and sanity
 could not so prosperously be delivered of i will
 leave him and suddenly contrive the means of
 meeting between him and my daughtermy honourable
 lord i will most humbly take my leave of you
hamlet you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will
 more willingly part withal except my life except
 my life except my life
lord polonius fare you well my lord
hamlet these tedious old fools
 enter rosencrantz and guildenstern
lord polonius you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is
rosencrantz to polonius god save you sir
 exit polonius
guildenstern my honoured lord
rosencrantz my most dear lord
hamlet my excellent good friends how dost thou
 guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both
rosencrantz as the indifferent children of the earth
guildenstern happy in that we are not overhappy
 on fortune's cap we are not the very button
hamlet nor the soles of her shoe
rosencrantz neither my lord
hamlet then you live about her waist or in the middle of
 her favours
guildenstern faith her privates we
hamlet in the secret parts of fortune o most true she
 is a strumpet what's the news
rosencrantz none my lord but that the world's grown honest
hamlet then is doomsday near but your news is not true
 let me question more in particular what have you
 my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune
 that she sends you to prison hither
guildenstern prison my lord
hamlet denmark's a prison
rosencrantz then is the world one
hamlet a goodly one in which there are many confines
 wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst
rosencrantz we think not so my lord
hamlet why then tis none to you for there is nothing
 either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me
 it is a prison
rosencrantz why then your ambition makes it one tis too
 narrow for your mind
hamlet o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count
 myself a king of infinite space were it not that i
 have bad dreams
guildenstern which dreams indeed are ambition for the very
 substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
hamlet a dream itself is but a shadow
rosencrantz truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a
 quality that it is but a shadow's shadow
hamlet then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and
 outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we
 to the court for by my fay i cannot reason
rosencrantz 
 we'll wait upon you
guildenstern 
hamlet no such matter i will not sort you with the rest
 of my servants for to speak to you like an honest
 man i am most dreadfully attended but in the
 beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore
rosencrantz to visit you my lord no other occasion
hamlet beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i
 thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are
 too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it
 your own inclining is it a free visitation come
 deal justly with me come come nay speak
guildenstern what should we say my lord
hamlet why any thing but to the purpose you were sent
 for and there is a kind of confession in your looks
 which your modesties have not craft enough to colour
 i know the good king and queen have sent for you
rosencrantz to what end my lord
hamlet that you must teach me but let me conjure you by
 the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of
 our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved
 love and by what more dear a better proposer could
 charge you withal be even and direct with me
 whether you were sent for or no
rosencrantz aside to guildenstern what say you
hamlet aside nay then i have an eye of youif you
 love me hold not off
guildenstern my lord we were sent for
hamlet i will tell you why so shall my anticipation
 prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king
 and queen moult no feather i have of latebut
 wherefore i know notlost all my mirth forgone all
 custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily
 with my disposition that this goodly frame the
 earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most
 excellent canopy the air look you this brave
 o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted
 with golden fire why it appears no other thing to
 me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
 what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason
 how infinite in faculty in form and moving how
 express and admirable in action how like an angel
 in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the
 world the paragon of animals and yet to me
 what is this quintessence of dust man delights not
 me no nor woman neither though by your smiling
 you seem to say so
rosencrantz my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
hamlet why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me'
rosencrantz to think my lord if you delight not in man what
 lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
 you we coted them on the way and hither are they
 coming to offer you service
hamlet he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty
 shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight
 shall use his foil and target the lover shall not
 sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part
 in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
 lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall
 say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt
 for't what players are they
rosencrantz even those you were wont to take delight in the
 tragedians of the city
hamlet how chances it they travel their residence both
 in reputation and profit was better both ways
rosencrantz i think their inhibition comes by the means of the
 late innovation
hamlet do they hold the same estimation they did when i was
 in the city are they so followed
rosencrantz no indeed are they not
hamlet how comes it do they grow rusty
rosencrantz nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but
 there is sir an aery of children little eyases
 that cry out on the top of question and are most
 tyrannically clapped for't these are now the
 fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they
 call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of
 goosequills and dare scarce come thither
hamlet what are they children who maintains em how are
 they escoted will they pursue the quality no
 longer than they can sing will they not say
 afterwards if they should grow themselves to common
 playersas it is most like if their means are no
 bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them
 exclaim against their own succession
rosencrantz faith there has been much to do on both sides and
 the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
 controversy there was for a while no money bid
 for argument unless the poet and the player went to
 cuffs in the question
hamlet is't possible
guildenstern o there has been much throwing about of brains
hamlet do the boys carry it away
rosencrantz ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too
hamlet it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of
 denmark and those that would make mows at him while
 my father lived give twenty forty fifty an
 hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
 sblood there is something in this more than
 natural if philosophy could find it out
 flourish of trumpets within
guildenstern there are the players
hamlet gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands
 come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
 and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb
 lest my extent to the players which i tell you
 must show fairly outward should more appear like
 entertainment than yours you are welcome but my
 unclefather and auntmother are deceived
guildenstern in what my dear lord
hamlet i am but mad northnorthwest when the wind is

 and then you know
 it came to pass as most like it was'
 the first row of the pious chanson will show you
 more for look where my abridgement comes
 enter four or five players
 you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad
 to see thee well welcome good friends o my old
 friend thy face is valenced since i saw thee last
 comest thou to beard me in denmark what my young
 lady and mistress by'r lady your ladyship is
 nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the
 altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like
 apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the
 ring masters you are all welcome we'll e'en
 to't like french falconers fly at any thing we see
 we'll have a speech straight come give us a taste
 of your quality come a passionate speech
first player what speech my lord
hamlet i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was
 never acted or if it was not above once for the
 play i remember pleased not the million twas
 caviare to the general but it wasas i received
 it and others whose judgments in such matters
 cried in the top of minean excellent play well
 digested in the scenes set down with as much
 modesty as cunning i remember one said there
 were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
 savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might
 indict the author of affectation but called it an
 honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very
 much more handsome than fine one speech in it i
 chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and
 thereabout of it especially where he speaks of
 priam's slaughter if it live in your memory begin
 at this line let me see let me see
 the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast'
 it is not soit begins with pyrrhus
 the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms
 black as his purpose did the night resemble
 when he lay couched in the ominous horse
 hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
 with heraldry more dismal head to foot
 now is he total gules horridly trick'd
 with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
 baked and impasted with the parching streets
 that lend a tyrannous and damned light
 to their lord's murder roasted in wrath and fire
 and thus o'ersized with coagulate gore
 with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus
 old grandsire priam seeks'
 so proceed you
lord polonius fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and
 good discretion
first player anon he finds him
 striking too short at greeks his antique sword
 rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
 repugnant to command unequal match'd
 pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide
 but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
 the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium
 seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
 stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
 takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword
 which was declining on the milky head
 of reverend priam seem'd i the air to stick
 so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood
 and like a neutral to his will and matter
 did nothing
 but as we often see against some storm
 a silence in the heavens the rack stand still
 the bold winds speechless and the orb below
 as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
 doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause
 aroused vengeance sets him new awork
 and never did the cyclops hammers fall
 on mars's armour forged for proof eterne
 with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword
 now falls on priam
 out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods
 in general synod take away her power
 break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
 and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
 as low as to the fiends'
lord polonius this is too long
hamlet it shall to the barber's with your beard prithee
 say on he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he
 sleeps say on come to hecuba
first player but who o who had seen the mobled queen'
hamlet the mobled queen'
lord polonius that's good mobled queen is good
first player run barefoot up and down threatening the flames
 with bisson rheum a clout upon that head
 where late the diadem stood and for a robe
 about her lank and all o'erteemed loins
 a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
 who this had seen with tongue in venom steep'd
 gainst fortune's state would treason have
 pronounced
 but if the gods themselves did see her then
 when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport
 in mincing with his sword her husband's limbs
 the instant burst of clamour that she made
 unless things mortal move them not at all
 would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
 and passion in the gods'
lord polonius look whether he has not turned his colour and has
 tears in's eyes pray you no more
hamlet tis well i'll have thee speak out the rest soon
 good my lord will you see the players well
 bestowed do you hear let them be well used for
 they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
 time after your death you were better have a bad
 epitaph than their ill report while you live
lord polonius my lord i will use them according to their desert
hamlet god's bodykins man much better use every man
 after his desert and who should scape whipping
 use them after your own honour and dignity the less
 they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
 take them in
lord polonius come sirs
hamlet follow him friends we'll hear a play tomorrow
 exit polonius with all the players but the first
 dost thou hear me old friend can you play the
 murder of gonzago
first player ay my lord
hamlet we'll ha't tomorrow night you could for a need
 study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which
 i would set down and insert in't could you not
first player ay my lord
hamlet very well follow that lord and look you mock him
 not
 exit first player
 my good friends i'll leave you till night you are
 welcome to elsinore
rosencrantz good my lord
hamlet ay so god be wi ye
 exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
 now i am alone
 o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
 is it not monstrous that this player here
 but in a fiction in a dream of passion
 could force his soul so to his own conceit
 that from her working all his visage wann'd
 tears in his eyes distraction in's aspect
 a broken voice and his whole function suiting
 with forms to his conceit and all for nothing
 for hecuba
 what's hecuba to him or he to hecuba
 that he should weep for her what would he do
 had he the motive and the cue for passion
 that i have he would drown the stage with tears
 and cleave the general ear with horrid speech
 make mad the guilty and appal the free
 confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
 the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i
 a dull and muddymettled rascal peak
 like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause
 and can say nothing no not for a king
 upon whose property and most dear life
 a damn'd defeat was made am i a coward
 who calls me villain breaks my pate across
 plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
 tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat
 as deep as to the lungs who does me this
 ha
 swounds i should take it for it cannot be
 but i am pigeonliver'd and lack gall
 to make oppression bitter or ere this
 i should have fatted all the region kites
 with this slave's offal bloody bawdy villain
 remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
 o vengeance
 why what an ass am i this is most brave
 that i the son of a dear father murder'd
 prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
 must like a whore unpack my heart with words
 and fall acursing like a very drab
 a scullion
 fie upon't foh about my brain i have heard
 that guilty creatures sitting at a play
 have by the very cunning of the scene
 been struck so to the soul that presently
 they have proclaim'd their malefactions
 for murder though it have no tongue will speak
 with most miraculous organ i'll have these players
 play something like the murder of my father
 before mine uncle i'll observe his looks
 i'll tent him to the quick if he but blench
 i know my course the spirit that i have seen
 may be the devil and the devil hath power
 to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
 out of my weakness and my melancholy
 as he is very potent with such spirits
 abuses me to damn me i'll have grounds
 more relative than this the play s the thing
 wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king

act iii
scene i a room in the castle
 enter king claudius queen gertrude polonius
 ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern
king claudius and can you by no drift of circumstance
 get from him why he puts on this confusion
 grating so harshly all his days of quiet
 with turbulent and dangerous lunacy
rosencrantz he does confess he feels himself distracted
 but from what cause he will by no means speak
guildenstern nor do we find him forward to be sounded
 but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
 when we would bring him on to some confession
 of his true state
queen gertrude did he receive you well
rosencrantz most like a gentleman
guildenstern but with much forcing of his disposition
rosencrantz niggard of question but of our demands
 most free in his reply
queen gertrude did you assay him
 to any pastime
rosencrantz madam it so fell out that certain players
 we o'erraught on the way of these we told him
 and there did seem in him a kind of joy
 to hear of it they are about the court
 and as i think they have already order
 this night to play before him
lord polonius tis most true
 and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
 to hear and see the matter
king claudius with all my heart and it doth much content me
 to hear him so inclined
 good gentlemen give him a further edge
 and drive his purpose on to these delights
rosencrantz we shall my lord
 exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
king claudius sweet gertrude leave us too
 for we have closely sent for hamlet hither
 that he as twere by accident may here
 affront ophelia
 her father and myself lawful espials
 will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
 we may of their encounter frankly judge
 and gather by him as he is behaved
 if t be the affliction of his love or no
 that thus he suffers for
queen gertrude i shall obey you
 and for your part ophelia i do wish
 that your good beauties be the happy cause
 of hamlet's wildness so shall i hope your virtues
 will bring him to his wonted way again
 to both your honours
ophelia madam i wish it may
 exit queen gertrude
lord polonius ophelia walk you here gracious so please you
 we will bestow ourselves
 to ophelia
 read on this book
 that show of such an exercise may colour
 your loneliness we are oft to blame in this
 tis too much provedthat with devotion's visage
 and pious action we do sugar o'er
 the devil himself
king claudius aside o tis too true
 how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
 the harlot's cheek beautied with plastering art
 is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
 than is my deed to my most painted word
 o heavy burthen
lord polonius i hear him coming let's withdraw my lord
 exeunt king claudius and polonius
 enter hamlet
hamlet to be or not to be that is the question
 whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
 the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
 or to take arms against a sea of troubles
 and by opposing end them to die to sleep
 no more and by a sleep to say we end
 the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
 that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
 devoutly to be wish'd to die to sleep
 to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub
 for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
 when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
 must give us pause there's the respect
 that makes calamity of so long life
 for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
 the oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely
 the pangs of despised love the law's delay
 the insolence of office and the spurns
 that patient merit of the unworthy takes
 when he himself might his quietus make
 with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
 to grunt and sweat under a weary life
 but that the dread of something after death
 the undiscover'd country from whose bourn
 no traveller returns puzzles the will
 and makes us rather bear those ills we have
 than fly to others that we know not of
 thus conscience does make cowards of us all
 and thus the native hue of resolution
 is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
 and enterprises of great pith and moment
 with this regard their currents turn awry
 and lose the name of actionsoft you now
 the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons
 be all my sins remember'd
ophelia good my lord
 how does your honour for this many a day
hamlet i humbly thank you well well well
ophelia my lord i have remembrances of yours
 that i have longed long to redeliver
 i pray you now receive them
hamlet no not i
 i never gave you aught
ophelia my honour'd lord you know right well you did
 and with them words of so sweet breath composed
 as made the things more rich their perfume lost
 take these again for to the noble mind
 rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
 there my lord
hamlet ha ha are you honest
ophelia my lord
hamlet are you fair
ophelia what means your lordship
hamlet that if you be honest and fair your honesty should
 admit no discourse to your beauty
ophelia could beauty my lord have better commerce than
 with honesty
hamlet ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner
 transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
 force of honesty can translate beauty into his
 likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the
 time gives it proof i did love you once
ophelia indeed my lord you made me believe so
hamlet you should not have believed me for virtue cannot
 so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
 it i loved you not
ophelia i was the more deceived
hamlet get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a
 breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest
 but yet i could accuse me of such things that it
 were better my mother had not borne me i am very
 proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at
 my beck than i have thoughts to put them in
 imagination to give them shape or time to act them
 in what should such fellows as i do crawling
 between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves
 all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery
 where's your father
ophelia at home my lord
hamlet let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the
 fool no where but in's own house farewell
ophelia o help him you sweet heavens
hamlet if thou dost marry i'll give thee this plague for
 thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as
 snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a
 nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs
 marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough
 what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go
 and quickly too farewell
ophelia o heavenly powers restore him
hamlet i have heard of your paintings too well enough god
 has given you one face and you make yourselves
 another you jig you amble and you lisp and
 nickname god's creatures and make your wantonness
 your ignorance go to i'll no more on't it hath
 made me mad i say we will have no more marriages
 those that are married already all but one shall
 live the rest shall keep as they are to a
 nunnery go
 exit
ophelia o what a noble mind is here o'erthrown
 the courtier's soldier's scholar's eye tongue sword
 the expectancy and rose of the fair state
 the glass of fashion and the mould of form
 the observed of all observers quite quite down
 and i of ladies most deject and wretched
 that suck'd the honey of his music vows
 now see that noble and most sovereign reason
 like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
 that unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
 blasted with ecstasy o woe is me
 to have seen what i have seen see what i see
 reenter king claudius and polonius
king claudius love his affections do not that way tend
 nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little
 was not like madness there's something in his soul
 o'er which his melancholy sits on brood
 and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose
 will be some danger which for to prevent
 i have in quick determination
 thus set it down he shall with speed to england
 for the demand of our neglected tribute
 haply the seas and countries different
 with variable objects shall expel
 this somethingsettled matter in his heart
 whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
 from fashion of himself what think you on't
lord polonius it shall do well but yet do i believe
 the origin and commencement of his grief
 sprung from neglected love how now ophelia
 you need not tell us what lord hamlet said
 we heard it all my lord do as you please
 but if you hold it fit after the play
 let his queen mother all alone entreat him
 to show his grief let her be round with him
 and i'll be placed so please you in the ear
 of all their conference if she find him not
 to england send him or confine him where
 your wisdom best shall think
king claudius it shall be so
 madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go

act iii
scene ii a hall in the castle
 enter hamlet and players
hamlet speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to
 you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it
 as many of your players do i had as lief the
 towncrier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air
 too much with your hand thus but use all gently
 for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say
 the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget
 a temperance that may give it smoothness o it
 offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
 periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to
 very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who
 for the most part are capable of nothing but
 inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such
 a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant it
 outherods herod pray you avoid it
first player i warrant your honour
hamlet be not too tame neither but let your own discretion
 be your tutor suit the action to the word the
 word to the action with this special o'erstep not
 the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is
 from the purpose of playing whose end both at the
 first and now was and is to hold as twere the
 mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature
 scorn her own image and the very age and body of
 the time his form and pressure now this overdone
 or come tardy off though it make the unskilful
 laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the
 censure of the which one must in your allowance
 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be
 players that i have seen play and heard others
 praise and that highly not to speak it profanely
 that neither having the accent of christians nor
 the gait of christian pagan nor man have so
 strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of
 nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
 well they imitated humanity so abominably
first player i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us
 sir
hamlet o reform it altogether and let those that play
 your clowns speak no more than is set down for them
 for there be of them that will themselves laugh to
 set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
 too though in the mean time some necessary
 question of the play be then to be considered
 that's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition
 in the fool that uses it go make you ready
 exeunt players

horatio here sweet lord at your service
hamlet horatio thou art e'en as just a man
 as e'er my conversation coped withal
horatio o my dear lord
hamlet nay do not think i flatter
 for what advancement may i hope from thee
 that no revenue hast but thy good spirits
 to feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flatter'd
 no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
 and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
 where thrift may follow fawning dost thou hear
 since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
 and could of men distinguish her election
 hath seal'd thee for herself for thou hast been
 as one in suffering all that suffers nothing
 a man that fortune's buffets and rewards
 hast ta'en with equal thanks and blest are those
 whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
 that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
 to sound what stop she please give me that man
 that is not passion's slave and i will wear him
 in my heart's core ay in my heart of heart
 as i do theesomething too much of this
 there is a play tonight before the king
 one scene of it comes near the circumstance
 which i have told thee of my father's death
 i prithee when thou seest that act afoot
 even with the very comment of thy soul
 observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt
 do not itself unkennel in one speech
 it is a damned ghost that we have seen
 and my imaginations are as foul
 as vulcan's stithy give him heedful note
 for i mine eyes will rivet to his face
 and after we will both our judgments join
 in censure of his seeming
horatio well my lord

 and scape detecting i will pay the theft

 hautboys play the dumbshow enters
 enter a king and a queen very lovingly the queen
 embracing him and he her she kneels and makes
 show of protestation unto him he takes her up
 and declines his head upon her neck lays him down
 upon a bank of flowers she seeing him asleep
 leaves him anon comes in a fellow takes off his
 crown kisses it and pours poison in the king's
 ears and exit the queen returns finds the king
 dead and makes passionate action the poisoner
 with some two or three mutes comes in again
 seeming to lament with her the dead body is
 carried away the poisoner wooes the queen with
 gifts she seems loath and unwilling awhile but
 in the end accepts his love
 exeunt
ophelia what means this my lord
hamlet marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief
ophelia belike this show imports the argument of the play
 enter prologue
hamlet we shall know by this fellow the players cannot
 keep counsel they'll tell all
ophelia will he tell us what this show meant
hamlet ay or any show that you'll show him be not you
 ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means
ophelia you are naught you are naught i'll mark the play
prologue for us and for our tragedy
 here stooping to your clemency
 we beg your hearing patiently
 exit
hamlet is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
ophelia tis brief my lord
hamlet as woman's love
 enter two players king and queen
player king full thirty times hath phoebus cart gone round
 neptune's salt wash and tellus orbed ground
 and thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
 about the world have times twelve thirties been
 since love our hearts and hymen did our hands
 unite commutual in most sacred bands
player queen so many journeys may the sun and moon
 make us again count o'er ere love be done
 but woe is me you are so sick of late
 so far from cheer and from your former state
 that i distrust you yet though i distrust
 discomfort you my lord it nothing must
 for women's fear and love holds quantity
 in neither aught or in extremity
 now what my love is proof hath made you know
 and as my love is sized my fear is so
 where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
 where little fears grow great great love grows there
player king faith i must leave thee love and shortly too
 my operant powers their functions leave to do
 and thou shalt live in this fair world behind
 honour'd beloved and haply one as kind
 for husband shalt thou
player queen o confound the rest
 such love must needs be treason in my breast
 in second husband let me be accurst
 none wed the second but who kill'd the first
hamlet aside wormwood wormwood
player queen the instances that second marriage move
 are base respects of thrift but none of love
 a second time i kill my husband dead
 when second husband kisses me in bed
player king i do believe you think what now you speak
 but what we do determine oft we break
 purpose is but the slave to memory
 of violent birth but poor validity
 which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
 but fall unshaken when they mellow be
 most necessary tis that we forget
 to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
 what to ourselves in passion we propose
 the passion ending doth the purpose lose
 the violence of either grief or joy
 their own enactures with themselves destroy
 where joy most revels grief doth most lament
 grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
 this world is not for aye nor tis not strange
 that even our loves should with our fortunes change
 for tis a question left us yet to prove
 whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
 the great man down you mark his favourite flies
 the poor advanced makes friends of enemies
 and hitherto doth love on fortune tend
 for who not needs shall never lack a friend
 and who in want a hollow friend doth try
 directly seasons him his enemy
 but orderly to end where i begun
 our wills and fates do so contrary run
 that our devices still are overthrown
 our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
 so think thou wilt no second husband wed
 but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
player queen nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
 sport and repose lock from me day and night
 to desperation turn my trust and hope
 an anchor's cheer in prison be my scope
 each opposite that blanks the face of joy
 meet what i would have well and it destroy
 both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
 if once a widow ever i be wife
hamlet if she should break it now
player king tis deeply sworn sweet leave me here awhile
 my spirits grow dull and fain i would beguile
 the tedious day with sleep
 sleeps
player queen sleep rock thy brain
 and never come mischance between us twain
 exit
hamlet madam how like you this play
queen gertrude the lady protests too much methinks
hamlet o but she'll keep her word
king claudius have you heard the argument is there no offence in t
hamlet no no they do but jest poison in jest no offence
 i the world
king claudius what do you call the play
hamlet the mousetrap marry how tropically this play
 is the image of a murder done in vienna gonzago is
 the duke's name his wife baptista you shall see
 anon tis a knavish piece of work but what o'
 that your majesty and we that have free souls it
 touches us not let the galled jade wince our
 withers are unwrung
 enter lucianus
 this is one lucianus nephew to the king
ophelia you are as good as a chorus my lord
hamlet i could interpret between you and your love if i
 could see the puppets dallying
ophelia you are keen my lord you are keen
hamlet it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
ophelia still better and worse
hamlet so you must take your husbands begin murderer
 pox leave thy damnable faces and begin come
 the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge'
lucianus thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
 confederate season else no creature seeing
 thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected
 with hecate's ban thrice blasted thrice infected
 thy natural magic and dire property
 on wholesome life usurp immediately
 pours the poison into the sleeper's ears
hamlet he poisons him i the garden for's estate his
 name's gonzago the story is extant and writ in
 choice italian you shall see anon how the murderer
 gets the love of gonzago's wife
ophelia the king rises
hamlet what frighted with false fire
queen gertrude how fares my lord
lord polonius give o'er the play
king claudius give me some light away
all lights lights lights
 exeunt all but hamlet and horatio
hamlet why let the stricken deer go weep
 the hart ungalled play
 for some must watch while some must sleep
 so runs the world away
 would not this sir and a forest of feathers if
 the rest of my fortunes turn turk with mewith two
 provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a
 fellowship in a cry of players sir
horatio half a share
hamlet a whole one i
 for thou dost know o damon dear
 this realm dismantled was
 of jove himself and now reigns here

guildenstern the king sir
hamlet ay sir what of him
guildenstern is in his retirement marvellous distempered
hamlet with drink sir
guildenstern no my lord rather with choler
hamlet your wisdom should show itself more richer to
 signify this to his doctor for for me to put him

 more choler
guildenstern good my lord put your discourse into some frame and
 start not so wildly from my affair

rosencrantz good my lord what is your cause of distemper you
 do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if
 you deny your griefs to your friend

 himself for your succession in denmark
hamlet ay but sir while the grass grows'the proverb

guildenstern o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too
 unmannerly

 your lingers and thumb give it breath with your
 mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music

guildenstern but these cannot i command to any utterance of
 harmony i have not the skill
hamlet why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of
 me you would play upon me you would seem to know
 my stops you would pluck out the heart of my
 mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to
 the top of my compass and there is much music
 excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot
 you make it speak sblood do you think i am
 easier to be played on than a pipe call me what
 instrument you will though you can fret me yet you
 cannot play upon me

 when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
 contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood

 would quake to look on soft now to my mother
 o heart lose not thy nature let not ever
 the soul of nero enter this firm bosom
 let me be cruel not unnatural
 i will speak daggers to her but use none

king claudius i like him not nor stands it safe with us
 to let his madness range therefore prepare you
 i your commission will forthwith dispatch
 and he to england shall along with you
 the terms of our estate may not endure
 hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
 out of his lunacies
guildenstern we will ourselves provide
 most holy and religious fear it is
 to keep those many many bodies safe
 that live and feed upon your majesty
rosencrantz the single and peculiar life is bound
 with all the strength and armour of the mind
 to keep itself from noyance but much more
 that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
 the lives of many the cease of majesty
 dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
 what's near it with it it is a massy wheel
 fix'd on the summit of the highest mount
 to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
 are mortised and adjoin'd which when it falls
 each small annexment petty consequence
 attends the boisterous ruin never alone
 did the king sigh but with a general groan
king claudius arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage
 for we will fetters put upon this fear
 which now goes too freefooted
rosencrantz 
 we will haste us

lord polonius my lord he's going to his mother's closet
 behind the arras i'll convey myself
 to hear the process and warrant she'll tax him home
 and as you said and wisely was it said
 tis meet that some more audience than a mother
 since nature makes them partial should o'erhear
 the speech of vantage fare you well my liege
 i'll call upon you ere you go to bed
 and tell you what i know
king claudius thanks dear my lord
 exit polonius
 o my offence is rank it smells to heaven
 it hath the primal eldest curse upon't
 a brother's murder pray can i not
 though inclination be as sharp as will
 my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
 and like a man to double business bound
 i stand in pause where i shall first begin
 and both neglect what if this cursed hand
 were thicker than itself with brother's blood
 is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
 to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy
 but to confront the visage of offence
 and what's in prayer but this twofold force
 to be forestalled ere we come to fall
 or pardon'd being down then i'll look up
 my fault is past but o what form of prayer
 can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder'
 that cannot be since i am still possess'd
 of those effects for which i did the murder
 my crown mine own ambition and my queen
 may one be pardon'd and retain the offence
 in the corrupted currents of this world
 offence's gilded hand may shove by justice
 and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself
 buys out the law but tis not so above
 there is no shuffling there the action lies
 in his true nature and we ourselves compell'd
 even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
 to give in evidence what then what rests
 try what repentance can what can it not
 yet what can it when one can not repent
 o wretched state o bosom black as death
 o limed soul that struggling to be free
 art more engaged help angels make assay
 bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
 be soft as sinews of the newborn babe
 all may be well
 retires and kneels
 enter hamlet
hamlet now might i do it pat now he is praying
 and now i'll do't and so he goes to heaven
 and so am i revenged that would be scann'd
 a villain kills my father and for that
 i his sole son do this same villain send
 to heaven
 o this is hire and salary not revenge
 he took my father grossly full of bread
 with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may
 and how his audit stands who knows save heaven
 but in our circumstance and course of thought
 tis heavy with him and am i then revenged
 to take him in the purging of his soul
 when he is fit and season'd for his passage
 no
 up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
 when he is drunk asleep or in his rage
 or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed
 at gaming swearing or about some act
 that has no relish of salvation in't
 then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
 and that his soul may be as damn'd and black
 as hell whereto it goes my mother stays
 this physic but prolongs thy sickly days

 words without thoughts never to heaven go

 tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
 and that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
 much heat and him i'll sconce me even here
 pray you be round with him

queen gertrude i'll warrant you
 fear me not withdraw i hear him coming
 polonius hides behind the arras
 enter hamlet
hamlet now mother what's the matter
queen gertrude hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
hamlet mother you have my father much offended
queen gertrude come come you answer with an idle tongue
hamlet go go you question with a wicked tongue
queen gertrude why how now hamlet
hamlet what's the matter now
queen gertrude have you forgot me
hamlet no by the rood not so
 you are the queen your husband's brother's wife
 andwould it were not soyou are my mother
queen gertrude nay then i'll set those to you that can speak
hamlet come come and sit you down you shall not budge
 you go not till i set you up a glass
 where you may see the inmost part of you
queen gertrude what wilt thou do thou wilt not murder me
 help help ho
lord polonius behind what ho help help help
hamlet drawing how now a rat dead for a ducat dead
 makes a pass through the arras
lord polonius behind o i am slain
 falls and dies
queen gertrude o me what hast thou done
hamlet nay i know not
 is it the king
queen gertrude o what a rash and bloody deed is this
hamlet a bloody deed almost as bad good mother
 as kill a king and marry with his brother
queen gertrude as kill a king
hamlet ay lady twas my word
 lifts up the array and discovers polonius
 thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
 i took thee for thy better take thy fortune
 thou find'st to be too busy is some danger
 leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down
 and let me wring your heart for so i shall
 if it be made of penetrable stuff
 if damned custom have not brass'd it so
 that it is proof and bulwark against sense
queen gertrude what have i done that thou darest wag thy tongue
 in noise so rude against me
hamlet such an act
 that blurs the grace and blush of modesty
 calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
 from the fair forehead of an innocent love
 and sets a blister there makes marriagevows
 as false as dicers oaths o such a deed
 as from the body of contraction plucks
 the very soul and sweet religion makes
 a rhapsody of words heaven's face doth glow
 yea this solidity and compound mass
 with tristful visage as against the doom
 is thoughtsick at the act
queen gertrude ay me what act
 that roars so loud and thunders in the index
hamlet look here upon this picture and on this
 the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
 see what a grace was seated on this brow
 hyperion's curls the front of jove himself
 an eye like mars to threaten and command
 a station like the herald mercury
 newlighted on a heavenkissing hill
 a combination and a form indeed
 where every god did seem to set his seal
 to give the world assurance of a man
 this was your husband look you now what follows
 here is your husband like a mildew'd ear
 blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes
 could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
 and batten on this moor ha have you eyes
 you cannot call it love for at your age
 the heyday in the blood is tame it's humble
 and waits upon the judgment and what judgment
 would step from this to this sense sure you have
 else could you not have motion but sure that sense
 is apoplex'd for madness would not err
 nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
 but it reserved some quantity of choice
 to serve in such a difference what devil was't
 that thus hath cozen'd you at hoodmanblind
 eyes without feeling feeling without sight
 ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
 or but a sickly part of one true sense
 could not so mope
 o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell
 if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones
 to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
 and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
 when the compulsive ardour gives the charge
 since frost itself as actively doth burn
 and reason panders will
queen gertrude o hamlet speak no more
 thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul
 and there i see such black and grained spots
 as will not leave their tinct
hamlet nay but to live
 in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
 stew'd in corruption honeying and making love
 over the nasty sty
queen gertrude o speak to me no more
 these words like daggers enter in mine ears
 no more sweet hamlet
hamlet a murderer and a villain
 a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
 of your precedent lord a vice of kings
 a cutpurse of the empire and the rule
 that from a shelf the precious diadem stole
 and put it in his pocket
queen gertrude no more
hamlet a king of shreds and patches
 enter ghost
 save me and hover o'er me with your wings
 you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure
queen gertrude alas he's mad
hamlet do you not come your tardy son to chide
 that lapsed in time and passion lets go by
 the important acting of your dread command o say
ghost do not forget this visitation
 is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
 but look amazement on thy mother sits
 o step between her and her fighting soul
 conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
 speak to her hamlet
hamlet how is it with you lady
queen gertrude alas how is't with you
 that you do bend your eye on vacancy
 and with the incorporal air do hold discourse
 forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
 and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm
 your bedded hair like life in excrements
 starts up and stands on end o gentle son
 upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
 sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look
hamlet on him on him look you how pale he glares
 his form and cause conjoin'd preaching to stones
 would make them capable do not look upon me
 lest with this piteous action you convert
 my stern effects then what i have to do
 will want true colour tears perchance for blood
queen gertrude to whom do you speak this
hamlet do you see nothing there
queen gertrude nothing at all yet all that is i see
hamlet nor did you nothing hear
queen gertrude no nothing but ourselves
hamlet why look you there look how it steals away
 my father in his habit as he lived
 look where he goes even now out at the portal
 exit ghost
queen gertrude this the very coinage of your brain
 this bodiless creation ecstasy
 is very cunning in
hamlet ecstasy
 my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
 and makes as healthful music it is not madness
 that i have utter'd bring me to the test
 and i the matter will reword which madness
 would gambol from mother for love of grace
 lay not that mattering unction to your soul
 that not your trespass but my madness speaks
 it will but skin and film the ulcerous place
 whilst rank corruption mining all within
 infects unseen confess yourself to heaven
 repent what's past avoid what is to come
 and do not spread the compost on the weeds
 to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue
 for in the fatness of these pursy times
 virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
 yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
queen gertrude o hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
hamlet o throw away the worser part of it
 and live the purer with the other half
 good night but go not to mine uncle's bed
 assume a virtue if you have it not
 that monster custom who all sense doth eat
 of habits devil is angel yet in this
 that to the use of actions fair and good
 he likewise gives a frock or livery
 that aptly is put on refrain tonight
 and that shall lend a kind of easiness
 to the next abstinence the next more easy
 for use almost can change the stamp of nature
 and either the devil or throw him out
 with wondrous potency once more good night
 and when you are desirous to be bless'd
 i'll blessing beg of you for this same lord
 pointing to polonius
 i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so
 to punish me with this and this with me
 that i must be their scourge and minister
 i will bestow him and will answer well
 the death i gave him so again good night
 i must be cruel only to be kind
 thus bad begins and worse remains behind
 one word more good lady
queen gertrude what shall i do
hamlet not this by no means that i bid you do
 let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
 pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
 and let him for a pair of reechy kisses
 or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers
 make you to ravel all this matter out
 that i essentially am not in madness
 but mad in craft twere good you let him know
 for who that's but a queen fair sober wise
 would from a paddock from a bat a gib
 such dear concernings hide who would do so
 no in despite of sense and secrecy
 unpeg the basket on the house's top
 let the birds fly and like the famous ape
 to try conclusions in the basket creep
 and break your own neck down
queen gertrude be thou assured if words be made of breath
 and breath of life i have no life to breathe
 what thou hast said to me
hamlet i must to england you know that
queen gertrude alack
 i had forgot tis so concluded on
hamlet there's letters seal'd and my two schoolfellows
 whom i will trust as i will adders fang'd
 they bear the mandate they must sweep my way
 and marshal me to knavery let it work
 for tis the sport to have the engineer
 hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard
 but i will delve one yard below their mines
 and blow them at the moon o tis most sweet
 when in one line two crafts directly meet
 this man shall set me packing
 i'll lug the guts into the neighbour room
 mother good night indeed this counsellor
 is now most still most secret and most grave
 who was in life a foolish prating knave
 come sir to draw toward an end with you

queen gertrude to draw apart the body he hath kill'd
 o'er whom his very madness like some ore
 among a mineral of metals base

 that capability and godlike reason
 to fust in us unused now whether it be
 bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
 of thinking too precisely on the event
 a thought which quarter'd hath but one part wisdom
 and ever three parts coward i do not know
 why yet i live to say this thing's to do'
 sith i have cause and will and strength and means
 to do't examples gross as earth exhort me
 witness this army of such mass and charge
 led by a delicate and tender prince
 whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
 makes mouths at the invisible event
 exposing what is mortal and unsure
 to all that fortune death and danger dare
 even for an eggshell rightly to be great
 is not to stir without great argument
 but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
 when honour's at the stake how stand i then
 that have a father kill'd a mother stain'd
 excitements of my reason and my blood
 and let all sleep while to my shame i see
 the imminent death of twenty thousand men
 that for a fantasy and trick of fame
 go to their graves like beds fight for a plot

 o this is the poison of deep grief it springs
 all from her father's death o gertrude gertrude
 when sorrows come they come not single spies
 but in battalions first her father slain
 next your son gone and he most violent author
 of his own just remove the people muddied
 thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
 for good polonius death and we have done but greenly
 in huggermugger to inter him poor ophelia
 divided from herself and her fair judgment
 without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
 last and as much containing as all these
 her brother is in secret come from france
 feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds
 and wants not buzzers to infect his ear
 with pestilent speeches of his father's death
 wherein necessity of matter beggar'd
 will nothing stick our person to arraign
 in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this
 like to a murderingpiece in many places
 gives me superfluous death
 a noise within
queen gertrude alack what noise is this
king claudius where are my switzers let them guard the door
 enter another gentleman
 what is the matter
gentleman save yourself my lord
 the ocean overpeering of his list
 eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
 than young laertes in a riotous head
 o'erbears your officers the rabble call him lord
 and as the world were now but to begin
 antiquity forgot custom not known
 the ratifiers and props of every word
 they cry choose we laertes shall be king'
 caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
 laertes shall be king laertes king'
queen gertrude how cheerfully on the false trail they cry
 o this is counter you false danish dogs
king claudius the doors are broke
 noise within
 enter laertes armed danes following
laertes where is this king sirs stand you all without
danes no let's come in
laertes i pray you give me leave
danes we will we will
 they retire without the door
laertes i thank you keep the door o thou vile king
 give me my father
queen gertrude calmly good laertes
laertes that drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard
 cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
 even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
 of my true mother
king claudius what is the cause laertes
 that thy rebellion looks so giantlike
 let him go gertrude do not fear our person
 there's such divinity doth hedge a king
 that treason can but peep to what it would
 acts little of his will tell me laertes
 why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude
 speak man
laertes where is my father
king claudius dead
queen gertrude but not by him
king claudius let him demand his fill
laertes how came he dead i'll not be juggled with
 to hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil
 conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
 i dare damnation to this point i stand
 that both the worlds i give to negligence
 let come what comes only i'll be revenged
 most thoroughly for my father
king claudius who shall stay you
laertes my will not all the world
 and for my means i'll husband them so well
 they shall go far with little
king claudius good laertes
 if you desire to know the certainty
 of your dear father's death is't writ in your revenge
 that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe
 winner and loser
laertes none but his enemies
king claudius will you know them then
laertes to his good friends thus wide i'll ope my arms
 and like the kind liferendering pelican
 repast them with my blood
king claudius why now you speak
 like a good child and a true gentleman
 that i am guiltless of your father's death
 and am most sensible in grief for it
 it shall as level to your judgment pierce
 as day does to your eye
danes within let her come in
laertes how now what noise is that
 reenter ophelia
 o heat dry up my brains tears seven times salt
 burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
 by heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
 till our scale turn the beam o rose of may
 dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia
 o heavens is't possible a young maid's wits
 should be as moral as an old man's life
 nature is fine in love and where tis fine
 it sends some precious instance of itself
 after the thing it loves
ophelia sings
 they bore him barefaced on the bier
 hey non nonny nonny hey nonny
 and in his grave rain'd many a tear
 fare you well my dove
laertes hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
 it could not move thus
ophelia sings
 you must sing adown adown
 an you call him adowna
 o how the wheel becomes it it is the false
 steward that stole his master's daughter
laertes this nothing's more than matter
ophelia there's rosemary that's for remembrance pray
 love remember and there is pansies that's for thoughts
laertes a document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted
ophelia there's fennel for you and columbines there's rue
 for you and here's some for me we may call it
 herbgrace o sundays o you must wear your rue with
 a difference there's a daisy i would give you
 some violets but they withered all when my father
 died they say he made a good end
 sings
 for bonny sweet robin is all my joy
laertes thought and affliction passion hell itself
 she turns to favour and to prettiness
ophelia sings
 and will he not come again
 and will he not come again
 no no he is dead
 go to thy deathbed
 he never will come again
 his beard was as white as snow
 all flaxen was his poll
 he is gone he is gone
 and we cast away moan
 god ha mercy on his soul
 and of all christian souls i pray god god be wi ye
 exit
laertes do you see this o god
king claudius laertes i must commune with your grief
 or you deny me right go but apart
 make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
 and they shall hear and judge twixt you and me
 if by direct or by collateral hand
 they find us touch'd we will our kingdom give
 our crown our life and all that we can ours
 to you in satisfaction but if not
 be you content to lend your patience to us
 and we shall jointly labour with your soul
 to give it due content
laertes let this be so
 his means of death his obscure funeral
 no trophy sword nor hatchment o'er his bones
 no noble rite nor formal ostentation
 cry to be heard as twere from heaven to earth
 that i must call't in question
king claudius so you shall
 and where the offence is let the great axe fall
 i pray you go with me

 enter king claudius and laertes
king claudius now must your conscience my acquaintance seal
 and you must put me in your heart for friend
 sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
 that he which hath your noble father slain
 pursued my life
laertes it well appears but tell me
 why you proceeded not against these feats
 so crimeful and so capital in nature
 as by your safety wisdom all things else
 you mainly were stirr'd up
king claudius o for two special reasons
 which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew'd
 but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother
 lives almost by his looks and for myself
 my virtue or my plague be it either which
 she's so conjunctive to my life and soul
 that as the star moves not but in his sphere
 i could not but by her the other motive
 why to a public count i might not go
 is the great love the general gender bear him
 who dipping all his faults in their affection
 would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
 convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
 too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind
 would have reverted to my bow again
 and not where i had aim'd them
laertes and so have i a noble father lost
 a sister driven into desperate terms
 whose worth if praises may go back again
 stood challenger on mount of all the age
 for her perfections but my revenge will come
king claudius break not your sleeps for that you must not think
 that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
 that we can let our beard be shook with danger
 and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more
 i loved your father and we love ourself
 and that i hope will teach you to imagine
 enter a messenger
 how now what news
messenger letters my lord from hamlet
 this to your majesty this to the queen
king claudius from hamlet who brought them
messenger sailors my lord they say i saw them not
 they were given me by claudio he received them
 of him that brought them
king claudius laertes you shall hear them leave us
 exit messenger
 reads
 high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on
 your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see
 your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your
 pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden
 and more strange return hamlet'
 what should this mean are all the rest come back
 or is it some abuse and no such thing
laertes know you the hand
king claudius tis hamlets character naked
 and in a postscript here he says alone'
 can you advise me
laertes i'm lost in it my lord but let him come
 it warms the very sickness in my heart
 that i shall live and tell him to his teeth
 thus didest thou'
king claudius if it be so laertes
 as how should it be so how otherwise
 will you be ruled by me
laertes ay my lord
 so you will not o'errule me to a peace
king claudius to thine own peace if he be now return'd
 as checking at his voyage and that he means
 no more to undertake it i will work him
 to an exploit now ripe in my device
 under the which he shall not choose but fall
 and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
 but even his mother shall uncharge the practise
 and call it accident
laertes my lord i will be ruled
 the rather if you could devise it so
 that i might be the organ
king claudius it falls right
 you have been talk'd of since your travel much
 and that in hamlet's hearing for a quality
 wherein they say you shine your sum of parts
 did not together pluck such envy from him
 as did that one and that in my regard
 of the unworthiest siege
laertes what part is that my lord
king claudius a very riband in the cap of youth
 yet needful too for youth no less becomes
 the light and careless livery that it wears
 than settled age his sables and his weeds
 importing health and graveness two months since
 here was a gentleman of normandy
 i've seen myself and served against the french
 and they can well on horseback but this gallant
 had witchcraft in't he grew unto his seat
 and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
 as he had been incorpsed and deminatured
 with the brave beast so far he topp'd my thought
 that i in forgery of shapes and tricks
 come short of what he did
laertes a norman was't
king claudius a norman
laertes upon my life lamond
king claudius the very same
laertes i know him well he is the brooch indeed
 and gem of all the nation
king claudius he made confession of you
 and gave you such a masterly report
 for art and exercise in your defence
 and for your rapier most especially
 that he cried out twould be a sight indeed
 if one could match you the scrimers of their nation
 he swore had had neither motion guard nor eye
 if you opposed them sir this report of his
 did hamlet so envenom with his envy
 that he could nothing do but wish and beg
 your sudden coming o'er to play with him
 now out of this
laertes what out of this my lord
king claudius laertes was your father dear to you
 or are you like the painting of a sorrow
 a face without a heart
laertes why ask you this
king claudius not that i think you did not love your father
 but that i know love is begun by time
 and that i see in passages of proof
 time qualifies the spark and fire of it
 there lives within the very flame of love
 a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
 and nothing is at a like goodness still
 for goodness growing to a plurisy
 dies in his own too much that we would do
 we should do when we would for this would changes
 and hath abatements and delays as many
 as there are tongues are hands are accidents
 and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh
 that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer
 hamlet comes back what would you undertake
 to show yourself your father's son in deed
 more than in words
laertes to cut his throat i the church
king claudius no place indeed should murder sanctuarize
 revenge should have no bounds but good laertes
 will you do this keep close within your chamber
 hamlet return'd shall know you are come home
 we'll put on those shall praise your excellence
 and set a double varnish on the fame
 the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
 and wager on your heads he being remiss
 most generous and free from all contriving
 will not peruse the foils so that with ease
 or with a little shuffling you may choose
 a sword unbated and in a pass of practise
 requite him for your father
laertes i will do't
 and for that purpose i'll anoint my sword
 i bought an unction of a mountebank
 so mortal that but dip a knife in it
 where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
 collected from all simples that have virtue
 under the moon can save the thing from death
 that is but scratch'd withal i'll touch my point
 with this contagion that if i gall him slightly
 it may be death
king claudius let's further think of this
 weigh what convenience both of time and means
 may fit us to our shape if this should fail
 and that our drift look through our bad performance
 twere better not assay'd therefore this project
 should have a back or second that might hold
 if this should blast in proof soft let me see
 we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings i ha't
 when in your motion you are hot and dry
 as make your bouts more violent to that end
 and that he calls for drink i'll have prepared him
 a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
 if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck
 our purpose may hold there
 enter queen gertrude
 how now sweet queen
queen gertrude one woe doth tread upon another's heel
 so fast they follow your sister's drown'd laertes
laertes drown'd o where
queen gertrude there is a willow grows aslant a brook
 that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
 there with fantastic garlands did she come
 of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
 that liberal shepherds give a grosser name
 but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them
 there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
 clambering to hang an envious sliver broke
 when down her weedy trophies and herself
 fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide
 and mermaidlike awhile they bore her up
 which time she chanted snatches of old tunes
 as one incapable of her own distress
 or like a creature native and indued
 unto that element but long it could not be
 till that her garments heavy with their drink
 pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
 to muddy death
laertes alas then she is drown'd
queen gertrude drown'd drown'd
laertes too much of water hast thou poor ophelia
 and therefore i forbid my tears but yet
 it is our trick nature her custom holds
 let shame say what it will when these are gone
 the woman will be out adieu my lord
 i have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
 but that this folly douts it
 exit
king claudius let's follow gertrude
 how much i had to do to calm his rage
 now fear i this will give it start again
 therefore let's follow

second clown but is this law
first clown ay marry is't crowner's quest law
second clown will you ha the truth on't if this had not been
 a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o'
 christian burial
first clown why there thou say'st and the more pity that
 great folk should have countenance in this world to
 drown or hang themselves more than their even
 christian come my spade there is no ancient
 gentleman but gardeners ditchers and gravemakers
 they hold up adam's profession
second clown was he a gentleman
first clown he was the first that ever bore arms
second clown why he had none

 question to thee if thou answerest me not to the
 purpose confess thyself

 mason the shipwright or the carpenter
second clown the gallowsmaker for that frame outlives a
 thousand tenants

 to contract o the time for ah my behove

hamlet has this fellow no feeling of his business that he
 sings at gravemaking
horatio custom hath made it in him a property of easiness
hamlet tis e'en so the hand of little employment hath
 the daintier sense
first clown sings
 but age with his stealing steps
 hath claw'd me in his clutch
 and hath shipped me intil the land
 as if i had never been such

hamlet that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
 how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were
 cain's jawbone that did the first murder it
 might be the pate of a politician which this ass
 now o'erreaches one that would circumvent god
 might it not
horatio it might my lord
hamlet or of a courtier which could say good morrow
 sweet lord how dost thou good lord this might
 be my lord suchaone that praised my lord
 suchaone's horse when he meant to beg it might it not

 o a pit of clay for to be made
 for such a guest is meet
 throws up another skull
hamlet there's another why may not that be the skull of a
 lawyer where be his quiddities now his quillets
 his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he
 suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
 sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of
 his action of battery hum this fellow might be
 in's time a great buyer of land with his statutes
 his recognizances his fines his double vouchers
 his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and
 the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
 pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him
 no more of his purchases and double ones too than
 the length and breadth of a pair of indentures the
 very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
 this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha
horatio not a jot more my lord
hamlet is not parchment made of sheepskins
horatio ay my lord and of calfskins too
hamlet they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
 in that i will speak to this fellow whose

hamlet how absolute the knave is we must speak by the
 card or equivocation will undo us by the lord

 it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
 peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
 gaffs his kibe how long hast thou been a
 gravemaker
first clown of all the days i the year i came to't that day
 that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras
hamlet how long is that since
first clown cannot you tell that every fool can tell that it
 was the very day that young hamlet was born he that
 is mad and sent into england
hamlet ay marry why was he sent into england
first clown why because he was mad he shall recover his wits
 there or if he do not it's no great matter there
hamlet why
first clown twill a not be seen in him there there the men
 are as mad as he
hamlet how came he mad
first clown very strangely they say
hamlet how strangely

 have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce
 hold the laying inhe will last you some eight year
 or nine year a tanner will last you nine year
hamlet why he more than another
first clown why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that
 he will keep out water a great while and your water
 is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body
 here's a skull now this skull has lain in the earth

 flagon of rhenish on my head once this same skull

hamlet this
first clown e'en that
hamlet let me see
 takes the skull
 alas poor yorick i knew him horatio a fellow
 of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath
 borne me on his back a thousand times and now how
 abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rims at
 it here hung those lips that i have kissed i know
 not how oft where be your gibes now your
 gambols your songs your flashes of merriment
 that were wont to set the table on a roar not one
 now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen
 now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let
 her paint an inch thick to this favour she must
 come make her laugh at that prithee horatio tell

hamlet dost thou think alexander looked o this fashion i'
 the earth
horatio e'en so
hamlet and smelt so pah
 puts down the skull
horatio e'en so my lord
hamlet to what base uses we may return horatio why may
 not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander
 till he find it stopping a bunghole
horatio twere to consider too curiously to consider so
hamlet no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with
 modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as
 thus alexander died alexander was buried
 alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of
 earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
 was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel
 imperious caesar dead and turn'd to clay
 might stop a hole to keep the wind away
 o that that earth which kept the world in awe
 should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw
 but soft but soft aside here comes the king
 enter priest &c in procession the corpse of
 ophelia laertes and mourners following king
 claudius queen gertrude their trains &c

 as we have warrantise her death was doubtful
 and but that great command o'ersways the order
 she should in ground unsanctified have lodged
 till the last trumpet for charitable prayers
 shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
 yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants
 her maiden strewments and the bringing home
 of bell and burial
laertes must there no more be done
first priest no more be done
 we should profane the service of the dead
 to sing a requiem and such rest to her
 as to peaceparted souls
laertes lay her i the earth
 and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
 may violets spring i tell thee churlish priest
 a ministering angel shall my sister be

 and not have strew'd thy grave
laertes o treble woe
 fall ten times treble on that cursed head
 whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
 deprived thee of hold off the earth awhile
 till i have caught her once more in mine arms
 leaps into the grave
 now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
 till of this flat a mountain you have made
 to o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head
 of blue olympus
hamlet advancing what is he whose grief
 bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
 conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand
 like wonderwounded hearers this is i
 hamlet the dane
 leaps into the grave
laertes the devil take thy soul

 to outface me with leaping in her grave
 be buried quick with her and so will i
 and if thou prate of mountains let them throw
 millions of acres on us till our ground
 singeing his pate against the burning zone
 make ossa like a wart nay an thou'lt mouth
 i'll rant as well as thou
queen gertrude this is mere madness
 and thus awhile the fit will work on him
 anon as patient as the female dove
 when that her golden couplets are disclosed
 his silence will sit drooping
hamlet hear you sir
 what is the reason that you use me thus
 i loved you ever but it is no matter
 let hercules himself do what he may
 the cat will mew and dog will have his day

horatio remember it my lord
hamlet sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
 that would not let me sleep methought i lay
 worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly
 and praised be rashness for it let us know
 our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
 when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us
 there's a divinity that shapes our ends
 roughhew them how we will
horatio that is most certain
hamlet up from my cabin
 my seagown scarf'd about me in the dark
 groped i to find out them had my desire
 finger'd their packet and in fine withdrew
 to mine own room again making so bold
 my fears forgetting manners to unseal
 their grand commission where i found horatio
 o royal knaveryan exact command
 larded with many several sorts of reasons
 importing denmark's health and england's too
 with ho such bugs and goblins in my life
 that on the supervise no leisure bated
 no not to stay the grinding of the axe
 my head should be struck off
horatio is't possible
hamlet here's the commission read it at more leisure
 but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed
horatio i beseech you
hamlet being thus benetted round with villanies
 ere i could make a prologue to my brains
 they had begun the playi sat me down
 devised a new commission wrote it fair
 i once did hold it as our statists do
 a baseness to write fair and labour'd much
 how to forget that learning but sir now
 it did me yeoman's service wilt thou know
 the effect of what i wrote
horatio ay good my lord
hamlet an earnest conjuration from the king
 as england was his faithful tributary
 as love between them like the palm might flourish
 as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
 and stand a comma tween their amities
 and many suchlike as'es of great charge
 that on the view and knowing of these contents
 without debatement further more or less
 he should the bearers put to sudden death
 not shrivingtime allow'd
horatio how was this seal'd
hamlet why even in that was heaven ordinant
 i had my father's signet in my purse
 which was the model of that danish seal
 folded the writ up in form of the other
 subscribed it gave't the impression placed it safely
 the changeling never known now the next day
 was our seafight and what to this was sequent
 thou know'st already
horatio so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to't
hamlet why man they did make love to this employment
 they are not near my conscience their defeat
 does by their own insinuation grow
 tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
 between the pass and fell incensed points
 of mighty opposites
horatio why what a king is this
hamlet does it not think'st thee stand me now upon
 he that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother
 popp'd in between the election and my hopes
 thrown out his angle for my proper life
 and with such cozenageis't not perfect conscience
 to quit him with this arm and is't not to be damn'd
 to let this canker of our nature come
 in further evil
horatio it must be shortly known to him from england
 what is the issue of the business there
hamlet it will be short the interim is mine
 and a man's life's no more than to say one'
 but i am very sorry good horatio
 that to laertes i forgot myself
 for by the image of my cause i see
 the portraiture of his i'll court his favours
 but sure the bravery of his grief did put me
 into a towering passion
horatio peace who comes here
 enter osric
osric your lordship is right welcome back to denmark
hamlet i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly
horatio no my good lord
hamlet thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to
 know him he hath much land and fertile let a
 beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at
 the king's mess tis a chough but as i say
 spacious in the possession of dirt
osric sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i
 should impart a thing to you from his majesty
hamlet i will receive it sir with all diligence of
 spirit put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head
osric i thank your lordship it is very hot
hamlet no believe me tis very cold the wind is
 northerly
osric it is indifferent cold my lord indeed
hamlet but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
 complexion
osric exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas
 twerei cannot tell how but my lord his
 majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
 great wager on your head sir this is the matter
hamlet i beseech you remember
 hamlet moves him to put on his hat
osric nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
 sir here is newly come to court laertes believe
 me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent
 differences of very soft society and great showing
 indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or
 calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the
 continent of what part a gentleman would see
hamlet sir his definement suffers no perdition in you
 though i know to divide him inventorially would
 dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw
 neither in respect of his quick sail but in the
 verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of
 great article and his infusion of such dearth and
 rareness as to make true diction of him his
 semblable is his mirror and who else would trace
 him his umbrage nothing more
osric your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
hamlet the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman
 in our more rawer breath
osric sir
horatio is't not possible to understand in another tongue
 you will do't sir really
hamlet what imports the nomination of this gentleman
osric of laertes
horatio his purse is empty already all's golden words are spent
hamlet of him sir
osric i know you are not ignorant
hamlet i would you did sir yet in faith if you did
 it would not much approve me well sir
osric you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is
hamlet i dare not confess that lest i should compare with
 him in excellence but to know a man well were to
 know himself
osric i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation
 laid on him by them in his meed he's unfellowed
hamlet what's his weapon
osric rapier and dagger
hamlet that's two of his weapons but well
osric the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary
 horses against the which he has imponed as i take
 it six french rapiers and poniards with their
 assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the
 carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very
 responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages
 and of very liberal conceit
hamlet what call you the carriages
horatio i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done
osric the carriages sir are the hangers
hamlet the phrase would be more german to the matter if we
 could carry cannon by our sides i would it might
 be hangers till then but on six barbary horses
 against six french swords their assigns and three
 liberalconceited carriages that's the french bet
 against the danish why is this imponed as you call it
osric the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes
 between yourself and him he shall not exceed you
 three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it
 would come to immediate trial if your lordship
 would vouchsafe the answer
hamlet how if i answer no'
osric i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
hamlet sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his
 majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let
 the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the
 king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can
 if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
osric shall i redeliver you e'en so
hamlet to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
osric i commend my duty to your lordship
hamlet yours yours
 exit osric
 he does well to commend it himself there are no
 tongues else for's turn
horatio this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
hamlet he did comply with his dug before he sucked it
 thus has heand many more of the same bevy that i
 know the dressy age dotes ononly got the tune of
 the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of
 yesty collection which carries them through and
 through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do
 but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out
 enter a lord
lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young
 osric who brings back to him that you attend him in
 the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
 play with laertes or that you will take longer time
hamlet i am constant to my purpose they follow the king's
 pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now
 or whensoever provided i be so able as now
lord the king and queen and all are coming down
hamlet in happy time
lord the queen desires you to use some gentle
 entertainment to laertes before you fall to play
hamlet she well instructs me
 exit lord
horatio you will lose this wager my lord
hamlet i do not think so since he went into france i
 have been in continual practise i shall win at the
 odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
 about my heart but it is no matter
horatio nay good my lord
hamlet it is but foolery but it is such a kind of
 gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman
horatio if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will
 forestall their repair hither and say you are not
 fit
hamlet not a whit we defy augury there's a special
 providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now
 tis not to come if it be not to come it will be
 now if it be not now yet it will come the
 readiness is all since no man has aught of what he
 leaves what is't to leave betimes
 enter king claudius queen gertrude laertes
 lords osric and attendants with foils &c
king claudius come hamlet come and take this hand from me
 king claudius puts laertes hand into hamlet's
hamlet give me your pardon sir i've done you wrong
 but pardon't as you are a gentleman
 this presence knows
 and you must needs have heard how i am punish'd
 with sore distraction what i have done
 that might your nature honour and exception
 roughly awake i here proclaim was madness
 was't hamlet wrong'd laertes never hamlet
 if hamlet from himself be ta'en away
 and when he's not himself does wrong laertes
 then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it
 who does it then his madness if't be so
 hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd
 his madness is poor hamlet's enemy
 sir in this audience
 let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
 free me so far in your most generous thoughts
 that i have shot mine arrow o'er the house
 and hurt my brother
laertes i am satisfied in nature
 whose motive in this case should stir me most
 to my revenge but in my terms of honour
 i stand aloof and will no reconcilement
 till by some elder masters of known honour
 i have a voice and precedent of peace
 to keep my name ungored but till that time
 i do receive your offer'd love like love
 and will not wrong it
hamlet i embrace it freely
 and will this brother's wager frankly play
 give us the foils come on
laertes come one for me
hamlet i'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance
 your skill shall like a star i the darkest night
 stick fiery off indeed
laertes you mock me sir
hamlet no by this hand
king claudius give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet
 you know the wager
hamlet very well my lord
 your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side
king claudius i do not fear it i have seen you both
 but since he is better'd we have therefore odds
laertes this is too heavy let me see another
hamlet this likes me well these foils have all a length
 they prepare to play
osric ay my good lord
king claudius set me the stoops of wine upon that table
 if hamlet give the first or second hit
 or quit in answer of the third exchange
 let all the battlements their ordnance fire
 the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath
 and in the cup an union shall he throw
 richer than that which four successive kings
 in denmark's crown have worn give me the cups
 and let the kettle to the trumpet speak
 the trumpet to the cannoneer without
 the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth
 now the king dunks to hamlet come begin
 and you the judges bear a wary eye
hamlet come on sir
laertes come my lord

 here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
 the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet
hamlet good madam

king claudius aside it is the poison'd cup it is too late
hamlet i dare not drink yet madam by and by
queen gertrude come let me wipe thy face
laertes my lord i'll hit him now
king claudius i do not think't
laertes aside and yet tis almost gainst my conscience
hamlet come for the third laertes you but dally
 i pray you pass with your best violence
 i am afeard you make a wanton of me
laertes say you so come on
 they play
osric nothing neither way
laertes have at you now
 laertes wounds hamlet then in scuffling they
 change rapiers and hamlet wounds laertes
king claudius part them they are incensed
hamlet nay come again
 queen gertrude falls
osric look to the queen there ho
horatio they bleed on both sides how is it my lord
osric how is't laertes
laertes why as a woodcock to mine own springe osric
 i am justly kill'd with mine own treachery
hamlet how does the queen
king claudius she swounds to see them bleed
queen gertrude no no the drink the drinko my dear hamlet
 the drink the drink i am poison'd
 dies
hamlet o villany ho let the door be lock'd
 treachery seek it out
laertes it is here hamlet hamlet thou art slain
 no medicine in the world can do thee good
 in thee there is not half an hour of life
 the treacherous instrument is in thy hand
 unbated and envenom'd the foul practise
 hath turn'd itself on me lo here i lie
 never to rise again thy mother's poison'd
 i can no more the king the king's to blame
hamlet the pointenvenom'd too
 then venom to thy work
 stabs king claudius
all treason treason
king claudius o yet defend me friends i am but hurt
hamlet here thou incestuous murderous damned dane
 drink off this potion is thy union here
 follow my mother
 king claudius dies
laertes he is justly served
 it is a poison temper'd by himself
 exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet
 mine and my father's death come not upon thee
 nor thine on me
 dies
hamlet heaven make thee free of it i follow thee
 i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu
 you that look pale and tremble at this chance
 that are but mutes or audience to this act
 had i but timeas this fell sergeant death
 is strict in his arresto i could tell you
 but let it be horatio i am dead
 thou livest report me and my cause aright
 to the unsatisfied
horatio never believe it
 i am more an antique roman than a dane
 here's yet some liquor left
hamlet as thou'rt a man
 give me the cup let go by heaven i'll have't
 o good horatio what a wounded name
 things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
 if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
 absent thee from felicity awhile
 and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
 to tell my story
 march afar off and shot within
 what warlike noise is this
osric young fortinbras with conquest come from poland
 to the ambassadors of england gives
 this warlike volley
hamlet o i die horatio
 the potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit
 i cannot live to hear the news from england
 but i do prophesy the election lights
 on fortinbras he has my dying voice
 so tell him with the occurrents more and less
 which have solicited the rest is silence
 dies
horatio now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince
 and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
 why does the drum come hither
 march within
 enter fortinbras the english ambassadors
 and others
prince fortinbras where is this sight
horatio what is it ye would see
 if aught of woe or wonder cease your search
prince fortinbras this quarry cries on havoc o proud death
 what feast is toward in thine eternal cell
 that thou so many princes at a shot
 so bloodily hast struck
first ambassador the sight is dismal
 and our affairs from england come too late
 the ears are senseless that should give us hearing
 to tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
 that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
 where should we have our thanks
horatio not from his mouth
 had it the ability of life to thank you
 he never gave commandment for their death
 but since so jump upon this bloody question
 you from the polack wars and you from england
 are here arrived give order that these bodies
 high on a stage be placed to the view
 and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
 how these things came about so shall you hear
 of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
 of accidental judgments casual slaughters
 of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause
 and in this upshot purposes mistook
 fall'n on the inventors reads all this can i
 truly deliver
prince fortinbras let us haste to hear it
 and call the noblest to the audience
 for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune
 i have some rights of memory in this kingdom
 which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
horatio of that i shall have also cause to speak
 and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
 but let this same be presently perform'd
 even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance
 on plots and errors happen
prince fortinbras let four captains
 bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage
 for he was likely had he been put on
 to have proved most royally and for his passage
 the soldiers music and the rites of war
 speak loudly for him
 take up the bodies such a sight as this
 becomes the field but here shows much amiss
 go bid the soldiers shoot
 a dead march exeunt bearing off the dead
 bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off

flavius hence home you idle creatures get you home
 is this a holiday what know you not
 being mechanical you ought not walk
 upon a labouring day without the sign
 of your profession speak what trade art thou
first commoner why sir a carpenter
marullus where is thy leather apron and thy rule
 what dost thou with thy best apparel on
 you sir what trade are you
second commoner truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but
 as you would say a cobbler
marullus but what trade art thou answer me directly
second commoner a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe
 conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
marullus what trade thou knave thou naughty knave what trade
second commoner nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet
 if you be out sir i can mend you
marullus what meanest thou by that mend me thou saucy fellow
second commoner why sir cobble you
flavius thou art a cobbler art thou
second commoner truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i
 meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's
 matters but with awl i am indeed sir a surgeon
 to old shoes when they are in great danger i
 recover them as proper men as ever trod upon
 neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork
flavius but wherefore art not in thy shop today
 why dost thou lead these men about the streets
second commoner truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself
 into more work but indeed sir we make holiday
 to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
marullus wherefore rejoice what conquest brings he home
 what tributaries follow him to rome
 to grace in captive bonds his chariotwheels
 you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
 o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome
 knew you not pompey many a time and oft
 have you climb'd up to walls and battlements
 to towers and windows yea to chimneytops
 your infants in your arms and there have sat
 the livelong day with patient expectation
 to see great pompey pass the streets of rome
 and when you saw his chariot but appear
 have you not made an universal shout
 that tiber trembled underneath her banks
 to hear the replication of your sounds
 made in her concave shores
 and do you now put on your best attire
 and do you now cull out a holiday
 and do you now strew flowers in his way
 that comes in triumph over pompey's blood be gone
 run to your houses fall upon your knees
 pray to the gods to intermit the plague
 that needs must light on this ingratitude
flavius go go good countrymen and for this fault
 assemble all the poor men of your sort
 draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears
 into the channel till the lowest stream
 do kiss the most exalted shores of all
 exeunt all the commoners
 see whether their basest metal be not moved
 they vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
 go you down that way towards the capitol
 this way will i disrobe the images
 if you do find them deck'd with ceremonies
marullus may we do so
 you know it is the feast of lupercal
flavius it is no matter let no images
 be hung with caesar's trophies i'll about
 and drive away the vulgar from the streets
 so do you too where you perceive them thick
 these growing feathers pluck'd from caesar's wing
 will make him fly an ordinary pitch
 who else would soar above the view of men
 and keep us all in servile fearfulness

 sennet exeunt all except brutus and cassius
cassius will you go see the order of the course
brutus not i
cassius i pray you do
brutus i am not gamesome i do lack some part
 of that quick spirit that is in antony
 let me not hinder cassius your desires
 i'll leave you
cassius brutus i do observe you now of late
 i have not from your eyes that gentleness
 and show of love as i was wont to have
 you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
 over your friend that loves you
brutus cassius
 be not deceived if i have veil'd my look
 i turn the trouble of my countenance
 merely upon myself vexed i am
 of late with passions of some difference
 conceptions only proper to myself
 which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
 but let not therefore my good friends be grieved
 among which number cassius be you one
 nor construe any further my neglect
 than that poor brutus with himself at war
 forgets the shows of love to other men
cassius then brutus i have much mistook your passion
 by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
 thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
 tell me good brutus can you see your face
brutus no cassius for the eye sees not itself
 but by reflection by some other things
cassius tis just
 and it is very much lamented brutus
 that you have no such mirrors as will turn
 your hidden worthiness into your eye
 that you might see your shadow i have heard
 where many of the best respect in rome
 except immortal caesar speaking of brutus
 and groaning underneath this age's yoke
 have wish'd that noble brutus had his eyes
brutus into what dangers would you lead me cassius
 that you would have me seek into myself
 for that which is not in me
cassius therefore good brutus be prepared to hear
 and since you know you cannot see yourself
 so well as by reflection i your glass
 will modestly discover to yourself
 that of yourself which you yet know not of
 and be not jealous on me gentle brutus
 were i a common laugher or did use
 to stale with ordinary oaths my love
 to every new protester if you know
 that i do fawn on men and hug them hard
 and after scandal them or if you know
 that i profess myself in banqueting
 to all the rout then hold me dangerous
 flourish and shout
brutus what means this shouting i do fear the people
 choose caesar for their king
cassius ay do you fear it
 then must i think you would not have it so
brutus i would not cassius yet i love him well
 but wherefore do you hold me here so long
 what is it that you would impart to me
 if it be aught toward the general good
 set honour in one eye and death i the other
 and i will look on both indifferently
 for let the gods so speed me as i love
 the name of honour more than i fear death
cassius i know that virtue to be in you brutus
 as well as i do know your outward favour
 well honour is the subject of my story
 i cannot tell what you and other men
 think of this life but for my single self
 i had as lief not be as live to be
 in awe of such a thing as i myself
 i was born free as caesar so were you
 we both have fed as well and we can both
 endure the winter's cold as well as he
 for once upon a raw and gusty day
 the troubled tiber chafing with her shores
 caesar said to me darest thou cassius now
 leap in with me into this angry flood
 and swim to yonder point upon the word
 accoutred as i was i plunged in
 and bade him follow so indeed he did
 the torrent roar'd and we did buffet it
 with lusty sinews throwing it aside
 and stemming it with hearts of controversy
 but ere we could arrive the point proposed
 caesar cried help me cassius or i sink'
 i as aeneas our great ancestor
 did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder
 the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber
 did i the tired caesar and this man
 is now become a god and cassius is
 a wretched creature and must bend his body
 if caesar carelessly but nod on him
 he had a fever when he was in spain
 and when the fit was on him i did mark
 how he did shake tis true this god did shake
 his coward lips did from their colour fly
 and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
 did lose his lustre i did hear him groan
 ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans
 mark him and write his speeches in their books
 alas it cried give me some drink titinius'
 as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me
 a man of such a feeble temper should
 so get the start of the majestic world
 and bear the palm alone
 shout flourish
brutus another general shout
 i do believe that these applauses are
 for some new honours that are heap'd on caesar
cassius why man he doth bestride the narrow world
 like a colossus and we petty men
 walk under his huge legs and peep about
 to find ourselves dishonourable graves
 men at some time are masters of their fates
 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
 but in ourselves that we are underlings
 brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar'
 why should that name be sounded more than yours
 write them together yours is as fair a name
 sound them it doth become the mouth as well
 weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em
 brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar
 now in the names of all the gods at once
 upon what meat doth this our caesar feed
 that he is grown so great age thou art shamed
 rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
 when went there by an age since the great flood
 but it was famed with more than with one man
 when could they say till now that talk'd of rome
 that her wide walls encompass'd but one man
 now is it rome indeed and room enough
 when there is in it but one only man
 o you and i have heard our fathers say
 there was a brutus once that would have brook'd
 the eternal devil to keep his state in rome
 as easily as a king
brutus that you do love me i am nothing jealous
 what you would work me to i have some aim
 how i have thought of this and of these times
 i shall recount hereafter for this present
 i would not so with love i might entreat you
 be any further moved what you have said
 i will consider what you have to say
 i will with patience hear and find a time
 both meet to hear and answer such high things
 till then my noble friend chew upon this
 brutus had rather be a villager
 than to repute himself a son of rome
 under these hard conditions as this time
 is like to lay upon us
cassius i am glad that my weak words
 have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus
brutus the games are done and caesar is returning
cassius as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve
 and he will after his sour fashion tell you
 what hath proceeded worthy note today
 reenter caesar and his train
brutus i will do so but look you cassius
 the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow
 and all the rest look like a chidden train
 calpurnia's cheek is pale and cicero
 looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
 as we have seen him in the capitol
 being cross'd in conference by some senators
cassius casca will tell us what the matter is
caesar antonius
antony caesar
caesar let me have men about me that are fat
 sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights
 yond cassius has a lean and hungry look
 he thinks too much such men are dangerous
antony fear him not caesar he's not dangerous
 he is a noble roman and well given
caesar would he were fatter but i fear him not
 yet if my name were liable to fear
 i do not know the man i should avoid
 so soon as that spare cassius he reads much
 he is a great observer and he looks
 quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays
 as thou dost antony he hears no music
 seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
 as if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
 that could be moved to smile at any thing
 such men as he be never at heart's ease
 whiles they behold a greater than themselves
 and therefore are they very dangerous
 i rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
 than what i fear for always i am caesar
 come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
 and tell me truly what thou think'st of him
 sennet exeunt caesar and all his train but casca
casca you pull'd me by the cloak would you speak with me
brutus ay casca tell us what hath chanced today
 that caesar looks so sad
casca why you were with him were you not
brutus i should not then ask casca what had chanced
casca why there was a crown offered him and being
 offered him he put it by with the back of his hand
 thus and then the people fell ashouting
brutus what was the second noise for
casca why for that too
cassius they shouted thrice what was the last cry for
casca why for that too
brutus was the crown offered him thrice
casca ay marry was't and he put it by thrice every
 time gentler than other and at every puttingby
 mine honest neighbours shouted
cassius who offered him the crown
casca why antony
brutus tell us the manner of it gentle casca
casca i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it
 it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark
 antony offer him a crownyet twas not a crown
 neither twas one of these coronetsand as i told
 you he put it by once but for all that to my
 thinking he would fain have had it then he
 offered it to him again then he put it by again
 but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his
 fingers off it and then he offered it the third
 time he put it the third time by and still as he
 refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their
 chapped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps
 and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
 caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
 caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and
 for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of
 opening my lips and receiving the bad air
cassius but soft i pray you what did caesar swound
casca he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at
 mouth and was speechless
brutus tis very like he hath the failing sickness
cassius no caesar hath it not but you and i
 and honest casca we have the falling sickness
casca i know not what you mean by that but i am sure
 caesar fell down if the tagrag people did not
 clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and
 displeased them as they use to do the players in
 the theatre i am no true man
brutus what said he when he came unto himself
casca marry before he fell down when he perceived the
 common herd was glad he refused the crown he
 plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
 throat to cut an i had been a man of any
 occupation if i would not have taken him at a word
 i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so
 he fell when he came to himself again he said
 if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired
 their worships to think it was his infirmity three
 or four wenches where i stood cried alas good
 soul and forgave him with all their hearts but
 there's no heed to be taken of them if caesar had
 stabbed their mothers they would have done no less
brutus and after that he came thus sad away
casca ay
cassius did cicero say any thing
casca ay he spoke greek
cassius to what effect
casca nay an i tell you that ill ne'er look you i the
 face again but those that understood him smiled at
 one another and shook their heads but for mine own
 part it was greek to me i could tell you more
 news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs
 off caesar's images are put to silence fare you
 well there was more foolery yet if i could
 remember it
cassius will you sup with me tonight casca
casca no i am promised forth
cassius will you dine with me tomorrow
casca ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
 worth the eating
cassius good i will expect you
casca do so farewell both
 exit
brutus what a blunt fellow is this grown to be
 he was quick mettle when he went to school
cassius so is he now in execution
 of any bold or noble enterprise
 however he puts on this tardy form
 this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
 which gives men stomach to digest his words
 with better appetite
brutus and so it is for this time i will leave you
 tomorrow if you please to speak with me
 i will come home to you or if you will
 come home to me and i will wait for you
cassius i will do so till then think of the world
 exit brutus
 well brutus thou art noble yet i see
 thy honourable metal may be wrought
 from that it is disposed therefore it is meet
 that noble minds keep ever with their likes
 for who so firm that cannot be seduced
 caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus
 if i were brutus now and he were cassius
 he should not humour me i will this night
 in several hands in at his windows throw
 as if they came from several citizens
 writings all tending to the great opinion
 that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
 caesar's ambition shall be glanced at
 and after this let caesar seat him sure
 for we will shake him or worse days endure
 exit
 julius caesar
act i
scene iii the same a street
 thunder and lightning enter from opposite sides
 casca with his sword drawn and cicero
cicero good even casca brought you caesar home
 why are you breathless and why stare you so
casca are not you moved when all the sway of earth
 shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero
 i have seen tempests when the scolding winds
 have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen
 the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
 to be exalted with the threatening clouds
 but never till tonight never till now
 did i go through a tempest dropping fire
 either there is a civil strife in heaven
 or else the world too saucy with the gods
 incenses them to send destruction
cicero why saw you any thing more wonderful
casca a common slaveyou know him well by sight
 held up his left hand which did flame and burn
 like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand
 not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd
 besidesi ha not since put up my sword
 against the capitol i met a lion
 who glared upon me and went surly by
 without annoying me and there were drawn
 upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
 transformed with their fear who swore they saw
 men all in fire walk up and down the streets
 and yesterday the bird of night did sit
 even at noonday upon the marketplace
 hooting and shrieking when these prodigies
 do so conjointly meet let not men say
 these are their reasons they are natural'
 for i believe they are portentous things
 unto the climate that they point upon
cicero indeed it is a strangedisposed time
 but men may construe things after their fashion
 clean from the purpose of the things themselves
 come caesar to the capitol tomorrow
casca he doth for he did bid antonius
 send word to you he would be there tomorrow
cicero good night then casca this disturbed sky
 is not to walk in
casca farewell cicero
 exit cicero
 enter cassius
cassius who's there
casca a roman
cassius casca by your voice
casca your ear is good cassius what night is this
cassius a very pleasing night to honest men
casca who ever knew the heavens menace so
cassius those that have known the earth so full of faults
 for my part i have walk'd about the streets
 submitting me unto the perilous night
 and thus unbraced casca as you see
 have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
 and when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
 the breast of heaven i did present myself
 even in the aim and very flash of it
casca but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
 it is the part of men to fear and tremble
 when the most mighty gods by tokens send
 such dreadful heralds to astonish us
cassius you are dull casca and those sparks of life
 that should be in a roman you do want
 or else you use not you look pale and gaze
 and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
 to see the strange impatience of the heavens
 but if you would consider the true cause
 why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
 why birds and beasts from quality and kind
 why old men fool and children calculate
 why all these things change from their ordinance
 their natures and preformed faculties
 to monstrous qualitywhy you shall find
 that heaven hath infused them with these spirits
 to make them instruments of fear and warning
 unto some monstrous state
 now could i casca name to thee a man
 most like this dreadful night
 that thunders lightens opens graves and roars
 as doth the lion in the capitol
 a man no mightier than thyself or me
 in personal action yet prodigious grown
 and fearful as these strange eruptions are
casca tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius
cassius let it be who it is for romans now
 have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
 but woe the while our fathers minds are dead
 and we are govern'd with our mothers spirits
 our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
casca indeed they say the senators tomorrow
 mean to establish caesar as a king
 and he shall wear his crown by sea and land
 in every place save here in italy
cassius i know where i will wear this dagger then
 cassius from bondage will deliver cassius
 therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
 therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
 nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
 nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
 can be retentive to the strength of spirit
 but life being weary of these worldly bars
 never lacks power to dismiss itself
 if i know this know all the world besides
 that part of tyranny that i do bear
 i can shake off at pleasure
 thunder still
casca so can i
 so every bondman in his own hand bears
 the power to cancel his captivity
cassius and why should caesar be a tyrant then
 poor man i know he would not be a wolf
 but that he sees the romans are but sheep
 he were no lion were not romans hinds
 those that with haste will make a mighty fire
 begin it with weak straws what trash is rome
 what rubbish and what offal when it serves
 for the base matter to illuminate
 so vile a thing as caesar but o grief
 where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this
 before a willing bondman then i know
 my answer must be made but i am arm'd
 and dangers are to me indifferent
casca you speak to casca and to such a man
 that is no fleering telltale hold my hand
 be factious for redress of all these griefs
 and i will set this foot of mine as far
 as who goes farthest
cassius there's a bargain made
 now know you casca i have moved already
 some certain of the noblestminded romans
 to undergo with me an enterprise
 of honourabledangerous consequence
 and i do know by this they stay for me
 in pompey's porch for now this fearful night
 there is no stir or walking in the streets
 and the complexion of the element
 in favour's like the work we have in hand
 most bloody fiery and most terrible
casca stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
cassius tis cinna i do know him by his gait
 he is a friend
 enter cinna
 cinna where haste you so
cinna to find out you who's that metellus cimber
cassius no it is casca one incorporate
 to our attempts am i not stay'd for cinna
cinna i am glad on t what a fearful night is this
 there's two or three of us have seen strange sights
cassius am i not stay'd for tell me
cinna yes you are
 o cassius if you could
 but win the noble brutus to our party
cassius be you content good cinna take this paper
 and look you lay it in the praetor's chair
 where brutus may but find it and throw this
 in at his window set this up with wax
 upon old brutus statue all this done
 repair to pompey's porch where you shall find us
 is decius brutus and trebonius there
cinna all but metellus cimber and he's gone
 to seek you at your house well i will hie
 and so bestow these papers as you bade me
cassius that done repair to pompey's theatre
 exit cinna
 come casca you and i will yet ere day
 see brutus at his house three parts of him
 is ours already and the man entire
 upon the next encounter yields him ours
casca o he sits high in all the people's hearts
 and that which would appear offence in us
 his countenance like richest alchemy
 will change to virtue and to worthiness
cassius him and his worth and our great need of him
 you have right well conceited let us go
 for it is after midnight and ere day
 we will awake him and be sure of him
 exeunt
 julius caesar
act ii
scene i rome brutus's orchard
 enter brutus
brutus what lucius ho
 i cannot by the progress of the stars
 give guess how near to day lucius i say
 i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
 when lucius when awake i say what lucius
 enter lucius
lucius call'd you my lord
brutus get me a taper in my study lucius
 when it is lighted come and call me here
lucius i will my lord
 exit
brutus it must be by his death and for my part
 i know no personal cause to spurn at him
 but for the general he would be crown'd
 how that might change his nature there's the question
 it is the bright day that brings forth the adder
 and that craves wary walking crown himthat
 and then i grant we put a sting in him
 that at his will he may do danger with
 the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
 remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar
 i have not known when his affections sway'd
 more than his reason but tis a common proof
 that lowliness is young ambition's ladder
 whereto the climberupward turns his face
 but when he once attains the upmost round
 he then unto the ladder turns his back
 looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
 by which he did ascend so caesar may
 then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel
 will bear no colour for the thing he is
 fashion it thus that what he is augmented
 would run to these and these extremities
 and therefore think him as a serpent's egg
 which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous
 and kill him in the shell
 reenter lucius
lucius the taper burneth in your closet sir
 searching the window for a flint i found
 this paper thus seal'd up and i am sure
 it did not lie there when i went to bed
 gives him the letter
brutus get you to bed again it is not day
 is not tomorrow boy the ides of march
lucius i know not sir
brutus look in the calendar and bring me word
lucius i will sir
 exit
brutus the exhalations whizzing in the air
 give so much light that i may read by them
 opens the letter and reads
 brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself
 shall rome &c speak strike redress
 brutus thou sleep'st awake'
 such instigations have been often dropp'd
 where i have took them up
 shall rome &c thus must i piece it out
 shall rome stand under one man's awe what rome
 my ancestors did from the streets of rome
 the tarquin drive when he was call'd a king
 speak strike redress am i entreated
 to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise
 if the redress will follow thou receivest
 thy full petition at the hand of brutus
 reenter lucius
lucius sir march is wasted fourteen days
 knocking within
brutus tis good go to the gate somebody knocks
 exit lucius
 since cassius first did whet me against caesar
 i have not slept
 between the acting of a dreadful thing
 and the first motion all the interim is
 like a phantasma or a hideous dream
 the genius and the mortal instruments
 are then in council and the state of man
 like to a little kingdom suffers then
 the nature of an insurrection
 reenter lucius
lucius sir tis your brother cassius at the door
 who doth desire to see you
brutus is he alone
lucius no sir there are moe with him
brutus do you know them
lucius no sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears
 and half their faces buried in their cloaks
 that by no means i may discover them
 by any mark of favour
brutus let em enter
 exit lucius
 they are the faction o conspiracy
 shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
 when evils are most free o then by day
 where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
 to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy
 hide it in smiles and affability
 for if thou path thy native semblance on
 not erebus itself were dim enough
 to hide thee from prevention
 enter the conspirators cassius casca decius
 brutus cinna metellus cimber and trebonius
cassius i think we are too bold upon your rest
 good morrow brutus do we trouble you
brutus i have been up this hour awake all night
 know i these men that come along with you
cassius yes every man of them and no man here
 but honours you and every one doth wish
 you had but that opinion of yourself
 which every noble roman bears of you
 this is trebonius
brutus he is welcome hither
cassius this decius brutus
brutus he is welcome too
cassius this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber
brutus they are all welcome
 what watchful cares do interpose themselves
 betwixt your eyes and night
cassius shall i entreat a word
 brutus and cassius whisper
decius brutus here lies the east doth not the day break here
casca no
cinna o pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines
 that fret the clouds are messengers of day
casca you shall confess that you are both deceived
 here as i point my sword the sun arises
 which is a great way growing on the south
 weighing the youthful season of the year
 some two months hence up higher toward the north
 he first presents his fire and the high east
 stands as the capitol directly here
brutus give me your hands all over one by one
cassius and let us swear our resolution
brutus no not an oath if not the face of men
 the sufferance of our souls the time's abuse
 if these be motives weak break off betimes
 and every man hence to his idle bed
 so let highsighted tyranny range on
 till each man drop by lottery but if these
 as i am sure they do bear fire enough
 to kindle cowards and to steel with valour
 the melting spirits of women then countrymen
 what need we any spur but our own cause
 to prick us to redress what other bond
 than secret romans that have spoke the word
 and will not palter and what other oath
 than honesty to honesty engaged
 that this shall be or we will fall for it
 swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
 old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
 that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
 such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
 the even virtue of our enterprise
 nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
 to think that or our cause or our performance
 did need an oath when every drop of blood
 that every roman bears and nobly bears
 is guilty of a several bastardy
 if he do break the smallest particle
 of any promise that hath pass'd from him
cassius but what of cicero shall we sound him
 i think he will stand very strong with us
casca let us not leave him out
cinna no by no means
metellus cimber o let us have him for his silver hairs
 will purchase us a good opinion
 and buy men's voices to commend our deeds
 it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands
 our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
 but all be buried in his gravity
brutus o name him not let us not break with him
 for he will never follow any thing
 that other men begin
cassius then leave him out
casca indeed he is not fit
decius brutus shall no man else be touch'd but only caesar
cassius decius well urged i think it is not meet
 mark antony so well beloved of caesar
 should outlive caesar we shall find of him
 a shrewd contriver and you know his means
 if he improve them may well stretch so far
 as to annoy us all which to prevent
 let antony and caesar fall together
brutus our course will seem too bloody caius cassius
 to cut the head off and then hack the limbs
 like wrath in death and envy afterwards
 for antony is but a limb of caesar
 let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius
 we all stand up against the spirit of caesar
 and in the spirit of men there is no blood
 o that we then could come by caesar's spirit
 and not dismember caesar but alas
 caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends
 let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully
 let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods
 not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
 and let our hearts as subtle masters do
 stir up their servants to an act of rage
 and after seem to chide em this shall make
 our purpose necessary and not envious
 which so appearing to the common eyes
 we shall be call'd purgers not murderers
 and for mark antony think not of him
 for he can do no more than caesar's arm
 when caesar's head is off
cassius yet i fear him
 for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar
brutus alas good cassius do not think of him
 if he love caesar all that he can do
 is to himself take thought and die for caesar
 and that were much he should for he is given
 to sports to wildness and much company
trebonius there is no fear in him let him not die
 for he will live and laugh at this hereafter
 clock strikes
brutus peace count the clock
cassius the clock hath stricken three
trebonius tis time to part
cassius but it is doubtful yet
 whether caesar will come forth today or no
 for he is superstitious grown of late
 quite from the main opinion he held once
 of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
 it may be these apparent prodigies
 the unaccustom'd terror of this night
 and the persuasion of his augurers
 may hold him from the capitol today
decius brutus never fear that if he be so resolved
 i can o'ersway him for he loves to hear
 that unicorns may be betray'd with trees
 and bears with glasses elephants with holes
 lions with toils and men with flatterers
 but when i tell him he hates flatterers
 he says he does being then most flattered
 let me work
 for i can give his humour the true bent
 and i will bring him to the capitol
cassius nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
brutus by the eighth hour is that the uttermost
cinna be that the uttermost and fail not then
metellus cimber caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard
 who rated him for speaking well of pompey
 i wonder none of you have thought of him
brutus now good metellus go along by him
 he loves me well and i have given him reasons
 send him but hither and i'll fashion him
cassius the morning comes upon s we'll leave you brutus
 and friends disperse yourselves but all remember
 what you have said and show yourselves true romans
brutus good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
 let not our looks put on our purposes
 but bear it as our roman actors do
 with untired spirits and formal constancy
 and so good morrow to you every one
 exeunt all but brutus
 boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter
 enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber
 thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
 which busy care draws in the brains of men
 therefore thou sleep'st so sound
 enter portia
portia brutus my lord
brutus portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
 it is not for your health thus to commit
 your weak condition to the raw cold morning
portia nor for yours neither you've ungently brutus
 stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
 you suddenly arose and walk'd about
 musing and sighing with your arms across
 and when i ask'd you what the matter was
 you stared upon me with ungentle looks
 i urged you further then you scratch'd your head
 and too impatiently stamp'd with your foot
 yet i insisted yet you answer'd not
 but with an angry wafture of your hand
 gave sign for me to leave you so i did
 fearing to strengthen that impatience
 which seem'd too much enkindled and withal
 hoping it was but an effect of humour
 which sometime hath his hour with every man
 it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
 and could it work so much upon your shape
 as it hath much prevail'd on your condition
 i should not know you brutus dear my lord
 make me acquainted with your cause of grief
brutus i am not well in health and that is all
portia brutus is wise and were he not in health
 he would embrace the means to come by it
brutus why so i do good portia go to bed
portia is brutus sick and is it physical
 to walk unbraced and suck up the humours
 of the dank morning what is brutus sick
 and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
 to dare the vile contagion of the night
 and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
 to add unto his sickness no my brutus
 you have some sick offence within your mind
 which by the right and virtue of my place
 i ought to know of and upon my knees
 i charm you by my oncecommended beauty
 by all your vows of love and that great vow
 which did incorporate and make us one
 that you unfold to me yourself your half
 why you are heavy and what men tonight
 have had to resort to you for here have been
 some six or seven who did hide their faces
 even from darkness
brutus kneel not gentle portia
portia i should not need if you were gentle brutus
 within the bond of marriage tell me brutus
 is it excepted i should know no secrets
 that appertain to you am i yourself
 but as it were in sort or limitation
 to keep with you at meals comfort your bed
 and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs
 of your good pleasure if it be no more
 portia is brutus harlot not his wife
brutus you are my true and honourable wife
 as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
 that visit my sad heart
portia if this were true then should i know this secret
 i grant i am a woman but withal
 a woman that lord brutus took to wife
 i grant i am a woman but withal
 a woman wellreputed cato's daughter
 think you i am no stronger than my sex
 being so father'd and so husbanded
 tell me your counsels i will not disclose em
 i have made strong proof of my constancy
 giving myself a voluntary wound
 here in the thigh can i bear that with patience
 and not my husband's secrets
brutus o ye gods
 render me worthy of this noble wife
 knocking within
 hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile
 and by and by thy bosom shall partake
 the secrets of my heart
 all my engagements i will construe to thee
 all the charactery of my sad brows
 leave me with haste
 exit portia
 lucius who's that knocks
 reenter lucius with ligarius
lucius he is a sick man that would speak with you
brutus caius ligarius that metellus spake of
 boy stand aside caius ligarius how
ligarius vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
brutus o what a time have you chose out brave caius
 to wear a kerchief would you were not sick
ligarius i am not sick if brutus have in hand
 any exploit worthy the name of honour
brutus such an exploit have i in hand ligarius
 had you a healthful ear to hear of it
ligarius by all the gods that romans bow before
 i here discard my sickness soul of rome
 brave son derived from honourable loins
 thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
 my mortified spirit now bid me run
 and i will strive with things impossible
 yea get the better of them what's to do
brutus a piece of work that will make sick men whole
ligarius but are not some whole that we must make sick
brutus that must we also what it is my caius
 i shall unfold to thee as we are going
 to whom it must be done
ligarius set on your foot
 and with a heart newfired i follow you
 to do i know not what but it sufficeth
 that brutus leads me on
brutus follow me then

 thunder and lightning enter caesar in his
 nightgown
caesar nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
 thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out
 help ho they murder caesar who's within
 enter a servant
servant my lord
caesar go bid the priests do present sacrifice
 and bring me their opinions of success
servant i will my lord
 exit
 enter calpurnia
calpurnia what mean you caesar think you to walk forth
 you shall not stir out of your house today
caesar caesar shall forth the things that threaten'd me
 ne'er look'd but on my back when they shall see
 the face of caesar they are vanished
calpurnia caesar i never stood on ceremonies
 yet now they fright me there is one within
 besides the things that we have heard and seen
 recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
 a lioness hath whelped in the streets
 and graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead
 fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
 in ranks and squadrons and right form of war
 which drizzled blood upon the capitol
 the noise of battle hurtled in the air
 horses did neigh and dying men did groan
 and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
 o caesar these things are beyond all use
 and i do fear them
caesar what can be avoided
 whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
 yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions
 are to the world in general as to caesar
calpurnia when beggars die there are no comets seen
 the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
caesar cowards die many times before their deaths
 the valiant never taste of death but once
 of all the wonders that i yet have heard
 it seems to me most strange that men should fear
 seeing that death a necessary end
 will come when it will come
 reenter servant
 what say the augurers
servant they would not have you to stir forth today
 plucking the entrails of an offering forth
 they could not find a heart within the beast
caesar the gods do this in shame of cowardice
 caesar should be a beast without a heart
 if he should stay at home today for fear
 no caesar shall not danger knows full well
 that caesar is more dangerous than he
 we are two lions litter'd in one day
 and i the elder and more terrible
 and caesar shall go forth
calpurnia alas my lord
 your wisdom is consumed in confidence
 do not go forth today call it my fear
 that keeps you in the house and not your own
 we'll send mark antony to the senatehouse
 and he shall say you are not well today
 let me upon my knee prevail in this
caesar mark antony shall say i am not well
 and for thy humour i will stay at home
 enter decius brutus
 here's decius brutus he shall tell them so
decius brutus caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar
 i come to fetch you to the senatehouse
caesar and you are come in very happy time
 to bear my greeting to the senators
 and tell them that i will not come today
 cannot is false and that i dare not falser
 i will not come today tell them so decius
calpurnia say he is sick
caesar shall caesar send a lie
 have i in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
 to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth
 decius go tell them caesar will not come
decius brutus most mighty caesar let me know some cause
 lest i be laugh'd at when i tell them so
caesar the cause is in my will i will not come
 that is enough to satisfy the senate
 but for your private satisfaction
 because i love you i will let you know
 calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
 she dreamt tonight she saw my statua
 which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
 did run pure blood and many lusty romans
 came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
 and these does she apply for warnings and portents
 and evils imminent and on her knee
 hath begg'd that i will stay at home today
decius brutus this dream is all amiss interpreted
 it was a vision fair and fortunate
 your statue spouting blood in many pipes
 in which so many smiling romans bathed
 signifies that from you great rome shall suck
 reviving blood and that great men shall press
 for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
 this by calpurnia's dream is signified
caesar and this way have you well expounded it
decius brutus i have when you have heard what i can say
 and know it now the senate have concluded
 to give this day a crown to mighty caesar
 if you shall send them word you will not come
 their minds may change besides it were a mock
 apt to be render'd for some one to say
 break up the senate till another time
 when caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams'
 if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
 lo caesar is afraid'
 pardon me caesar for my dear dear love
 to our proceeding bids me tell you this
 and reason to my love is liable
caesar how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia
 i am ashamed i did yield to them
 give me my robe for i will go
 enter publius brutus ligarius metellus casca

scene i rome before the capitol the senate sitting above
 a crowd of people among them artemidorus and the
 soothsayer flourish enter caesar brutus
 cassius casca decius brutus metellus cimber
 trebonius cinna antony lepidus popilius
 publius and others
caesar to the soothsayer the ides of march are come
soothsayer ay caesar but not gone
artemidorus hail caesar read this schedule
decius brutus trebonius doth desire you to o'erread

artemidorus delay not caesar read it instantly
caesar what is the fellow mad
publius sirrah give place
cassius what urge you your petitions in the street

 caesar goes up to the senatehouse the rest
 following
popilius i wish your enterprise today may thrive
cassius what enterprise popilius
popilius fare you well
 advances to caesar
brutus what said popilius lena
cassius he wish'd today our enterprise might thrive
 i fear our purpose is discovered
brutus look how he makes to caesar mark him
cassius casca be sudden for we fear prevention
 brutus what shall be done if this be known
 cassius or caesar never shall turn back
 for i will slay myself
brutus cassius be constant
 popilius lena speaks not of our purposes
 for look he smiles and caesar doth not change
cassius trebonius knows his time for look you brutus
 he draws mark antony out of the way
 exeunt antony and trebonius
decius brutus where is metellus cimber let him go
 and presently prefer his suit to caesar
brutus he is address'd press near and second him
cinna casca you are the first that rears your hand
caesar are we all ready what is now amiss
 that caesar and his senate must redress
metellus cimber most high most mighty and most puissant caesar
 metellus cimber throws before thy seat
 an humble heart
 kneeling
caesar i must prevent thee cimber
 these couchings and these lowly courtesies
 might fire the blood of ordinary men
 and turn preordinance and first decree
 into the law of children be not fond
 to think that caesar bears such rebel blood
 that will be thaw'd from the true quality
 with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words
 lowcrooked court'sies and base spanielfawning
 thy brother by decree is banished
 if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
 i spurn thee like a cur out of my way
 know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
 will he be satisfied
metellus cimber is there no voice more worthy than my own
 to sound more sweetly in great caesar's ear
 for the repealing of my banish'd brother
brutus i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar
 desiring thee that publius cimber may
 have an immediate freedom of repeal
caesar what brutus
cassius pardon caesar caesar pardon
 as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall
 to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber
cassius i could be well moved if i were as you
 if i could pray to move prayers would move me
 but i am constant as the northern star
 of whose truefix'd and resting quality
 there is no fellow in the firmament
 the skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks
 they are all fire and every one doth shine
 but there's but one in all doth hold his place
 so in the world tis furnish'd well with men
 and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
 yet in the number i do know but one
 that unassailable holds on his rank
 unshaked of motion and that i am he
 let me a little show it even in this
 that i was constant cimber should be banish'd
 and constant do remain to keep him so
cinna o caesar
caesar hence wilt thou lift up olympus
decius brutus great caesar
caesar doth not brutus bootless kneel
casca speak hands for me
 casca first then the other conspirators and
 brutus stab caesar
caesar et tu brute then fall caesar

brutus people and senators be not affrighted
 fly not stand stiff ambition's debt is paid
casca go to the pulpit brutus
decius brutus and cassius too
brutus where's publius
cinna here quite confounded with this mutiny
metellus cimber stand fast together lest some friend of caesar's
 should chance
brutus talk not of standing publius good cheer
 there is no harm intended to your person
 nor to no roman else so tell them publius
cassius and leave us publius lest that the people
 rushing on us should do your age some mischief
brutus do so and let no man abide this deed
 but we the doers
 reenter trebonius
cassius where is antony
trebonius fled to his house amazed
 men wives and children stare cry out and run
 as it were doomsday
brutus fates we will know your pleasures
 that we shall die we know tis but the time
 and drawing days out that men stand upon
cassius why he that cuts off twenty years of life
 cuts off so many years of fearing death
brutus grant that and then is death a benefit
 so are we caesar's friends that have abridged
 his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop
 and let us bathe our hands in caesar's blood
 up to the elbows and besmear our swords
 then walk we forth even to the marketplace
 and waving our red weapons o'er our heads
 let's all cry peace freedom and liberty'
cassius stoop then and wash how many ages hence
 shall this our lofty scene be acted over
 in states unborn and accents yet unknown
brutus how many times shall caesar bleed in sport
 that now on pompey's basis lies along
 no worthier than the dust
cassius so oft as that shall be
 so often shall the knot of us be call'd
 the men that gave their country liberty
decius brutus what shall we forth
cassius ay every man away
 brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
 with the most boldest and best hearts of rome
 enter a servant
brutus soft who comes here a friend of antony's
servant thus brutus did my master bid me kneel
 thus did mark antony bid me fall down
 and being prostrate thus he bade me say
 brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
 caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
 say i love brutus and i honour him
 say i fear'd caesar honour'd him and loved him
 if brutus will vouchsafe that antony
 may safely come to him and be resolved
 how caesar hath deserved to lie in death
 mark antony shall not love caesar dead
 so well as brutus living but will follow
 the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus
 thorough the hazards of this untrod state
 with all true faith so says my master antony
brutus thy master is a wise and valiant roman
 i never thought him worse
 tell him so please him come unto this place
 he shall be satisfied and by my honour
 depart untouch'd
servant i'll fetch him presently
 exit
brutus i know that we shall have him well to friend
cassius i wish we may but yet have i a mind
 that fears him much and my misgiving still
 falls shrewdly to the purpose
brutus but here comes antony
 reenter antony
 welcome mark antony
antony o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low
 are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
 shrunk to this little measure fare thee well
 i know not gentlemen what you intend
 who else must be let blood who else is rank
 if i myself there is no hour so fit
 as caesar's death hour nor no instrument
 of half that worth as those your swords made rich
 with the most noble blood of all this world
 i do beseech ye if you bear me hard
 now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
 fulfil your pleasure live a thousand years
 i shall not find myself so apt to die
 no place will please me so no mean of death
 as here by caesar and by you cut off
 the choice and master spirits of this age
brutus o antony beg not your death of us
 though now we must appear bloody and cruel
 as by our hands and this our present act
 you see we do yet see you but our hands
 and this the bleeding business they have done
 our hearts you see not they are pitiful
 and pity to the general wrong of rome
 as fire drives out fire so pity pity
 hath done this deed on caesar for your part
 to you our swords have leaden points mark antony
 our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
 of brothers temper do receive you in
 with all kind love good thoughts and reverence
cassius your voice shall be as strong as any man's
 in the disposing of new dignities
brutus only be patient till we have appeased
 the multitude beside themselves with fear
 and then we will deliver you the cause
 why i that did love caesar when i struck him
 have thus proceeded
antony i doubt not of your wisdom
 let each man render me his bloody hand
 first marcus brutus will i shake with you
 next caius cassius do i take your hand
 now decius brutus yours now yours metellus
 yours cinna and my valiant casca yours
 though last not last in love yours good trebonius
 gentlemen allalas what shall i say
 my credit now stands on such slippery ground
 that one of two bad ways you must conceit me
 either a coward or a flatterer
 that i did love thee caesar o tis true
 if then thy spirit look upon us now
 shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
 to see thy thy anthony making his peace
 shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
 most noble in the presence of thy corse
 had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds
 weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
 it would become me better than to close
 in terms of friendship with thine enemies
 pardon me julius here wast thou bay'd brave hart
 here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
 sign'd in thy spoil and crimson'd in thy lethe
 o world thou wast the forest to this hart
 and this indeed o world the heart of thee
 how like a deer strucken by many princes
 dost thou here lie
cassius mark antony
antony pardon me caius cassius
 the enemies of caesar shall say this
 then in a friend it is cold modesty
cassius i blame you not for praising caesar so
 but what compact mean you to have with us
 will you be prick'd in number of our friends
 or shall we on and not depend on you
antony therefore i took your hands but was indeed
 sway'd from the point by looking down on caesar
 friends am i with you all and love you all
 upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
 why and wherein caesar was dangerous
brutus or else were this a savage spectacle
 our reasons are so full of good regard
 that were you antony the son of caesar
 you should be satisfied
antony that's all i seek
 and am moreover suitor that i may
 produce his body to the marketplace
 and in the pulpit as becomes a friend
 speak in the order of his funeral
brutus you shall mark antony
cassius brutus a word with you
 aside to brutus
 you know not what you do do not consent
 that antony speak in his funeral
 know you how much the people may be moved
 by that which he will utter
brutus by your pardon
 i will myself into the pulpit first
 and show the reason of our caesar's death
 what antony shall speak i will protest
 he speaks by leave and by permission
 and that we are contented caesar shall
 have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
 it shall advantage more than do us wrong
cassius i know not what may fall i like it not
brutus mark antony here take you caesar's body
 you shall not in your funeral speech blame us
 but speak all good you can devise of caesar
 and say you do't by our permission
 else shall you not have any hand at all
 about his funeral and you shall speak
 in the same pulpit whereto i am going
 after my speech is ended
antony be it so
 i do desire no more
brutus prepare the body then and follow us
 exeunt all but antony
antony o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
 that i am meek and gentle with these butchers
 thou art the ruins of the noblest man
 that ever lived in the tide of times
 woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
 over thy wounds now do i prophesy
 which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
 to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
 a curse shall light upon the limbs of men
 domestic fury and fierce civil strife
 shall cumber all the parts of italy
 blood and destruction shall be so in use
 and dreadful objects so familiar
 that mothers shall but smile when they behold
 their infants quarter'd with the hands of war
 all pity choked with custom of fell deeds
 and caesar's spirit ranging for revenge
 with ate by his side come hot from hell
 shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
 that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
 with carrion men groaning for burial
 enter a servant
 you serve octavius caesar do you not
servant i do mark antony
antony caesar did write for him to come to rome
servant he did receive his letters and is coming
 and bid me say to you by word of mouth
 o caesar
 seeing the body
antony thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
 passion i see is catching for mine eyes
 seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
 began to water is thy master coming
servant he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome
antony post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
 here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome
 no rome of safety for octavius yet
 hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile
 thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse
 into the marketplace there shall i try
 in my oration how the people take
 the cruel issue of these bloody men
 according to the which thou shalt discourse
 to young octavius of the state of things
 lend me your hand
 exeunt with caesar's body
 julius caesar
act iii
scene ii the forum
 enter brutus and cassius and a throng of citizens
citizens we will be satisfied let us be satisfied
brutus then follow me and give me audience friends
 cassius go you into the other street
 and part the numbers
 those that will hear me speak let em stay here
 those that will follow cassius go with him
 and public reasons shall be rendered
 of caesar's death
first citizen i will hear brutus speak
second citizen i will hear cassius and compare their reasons
 when severally we hear them rendered
 exit cassius with some of the citizens brutus
 goes into the pulpit
third citizen the noble brutus is ascended silence
brutus be patient till the last
 romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my
 cause and be silent that you may hear believe me
 for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that
 you may believe censure me in your wisdom and
 awake your senses that you may the better judge
 if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of
 caesar's to him i say that brutus love to caesar
 was no less than his if then that friend demand
 why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer
 not that i loved caesar less but that i loved
 rome more had you rather caesar were living and
 die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live
 all free men as caesar loved me i weep for him
 as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was
 valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i
 slew him there is tears for his love joy for his
 fortune honour for his valour and death for his
 ambition who is here so base that would be a
 bondman if any speak for him have i offended
 who is here so rude that would not be a roman if
 any speak for him have i offended who is here so
 vile that will not love his country if any speak
 for him have i offended i pause for a reply
all none brutus none
brutus then none have i offended i have done no more to
 caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of
 his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not
 extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences
 enforced for which he suffered death
 enter antony and others with caesar's body
 here comes his body mourned by mark antony who
 though he had no hand in his death shall receive
 the benefit of his dying a place in the
 commonwealth as which of you shall not with this
 i departthat as i slew my best lover for the
 good of rome i have the same dagger for myself
 when it shall please my country to need my death
all live brutus live live
first citizen bring him with triumph home unto his house
second citizen give him a statue with his ancestors
third citizen let him be caesar
fourth citizen caesar's better parts
 shall be crown'd in brutus
first citizen we'll bring him to his house
 with shouts and clamours
brutus my countrymen
second citizen peace silence brutus speaks
first citizen peace ho
brutus good countrymen let me depart alone
 and for my sake stay here with antony
 do grace to caesar's corpse and grace his speech
 tending to caesar's glories which mark antony
 by our permission is allow'd to make
 i do entreat you not a man depart
 save i alone till antony have spoke
 exit
first citizen stay ho and let us hear mark antony
third citizen let him go up into the public chair
 we'll hear him noble antony go up
antony for brutus sake i am beholding to you
 goes into the pulpit
fourth citizen what does he say of brutus
third citizen he says for brutus sake
 he finds himself beholding to us all
fourth citizen twere best he speak no harm of brutus here
first citizen this caesar was a tyrant
third citizen nay that's certain
 we are blest that rome is rid of him
second citizen peace let us hear what antony can say
antony you gentle romans
citizens peace ho let us hear him
antony friends romans countrymen lend me your ears
 i come to bury caesar not to praise him
 the evil that men do lives after them
 the good is oft interred with their bones
 so let it be with caesar the noble brutus
 hath told you caesar was ambitious
 if it were so it was a grievous fault
 and grievously hath caesar answer'd it
 here under leave of brutus and the rest
 for brutus is an honourable man
 so are they all all honourable men
 come i to speak in caesar's funeral
 he was my friend faithful and just to me
 but brutus says he was ambitious
 and brutus is an honourable man
 he hath brought many captives home to rome
 whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
 did this in caesar seem ambitious
 when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept
 ambition should be made of sterner stuff
 yet brutus says he was ambitious
 and brutus is an honourable man
 you all did see that on the lupercal
 i thrice presented him a kingly crown
 which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
 yet brutus says he was ambitious
 and sure he is an honourable man
 i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke
 but here i am to speak what i do know
 you all did love him once not without cause
 what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
 o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
 and men have lost their reason bear with me
 my heart is in the coffin there with caesar
 and i must pause till it come back to me
first citizen methinks there is much reason in his sayings
second citizen if thou consider rightly of the matter
 caesar has had great wrong
third citizen has he masters
 i fear there will a worse come in his place
fourth citizen mark'd ye his words he would not take the crown
 therefore tis certain he was not ambitious
first citizen if it be found so some will dear abide it
second citizen poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
third citizen there's not a nobler man in rome than antony
fourth citizen now mark him he begins again to speak
antony but yesterday the word of caesar might
 have stood against the world now lies he there
 and none so poor to do him reverence
 o masters if i were disposed to stir
 your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
 i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong
 who you all know are honourable men
 i will not do them wrong i rather choose
 to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
 than i will wrong such honourable men
 but here's a parchment with the seal of caesar
 i found it in his closet tis his will
 let but the commons hear this testament
 which pardon me i do not mean to read
 and they would go and kiss dead caesar's wounds
 and dip their napkins in his sacred blood
 yea beg a hair of him for memory
 and dying mention it within their wills
 bequeathing it as a rich legacy
 unto their issue
fourth citizen we'll hear the will read it mark antony
all the will the will we will hear caesar's will
antony have patience gentle friends i must not read it
 it is not meet you know how caesar loved you
 you are not wood you are not stones but men
 and being men bearing the will of caesar
 it will inflame you it will make you mad
 tis good you know not that you are his heirs
 for if you should o what would come of it
fourth citizen read the will we'll hear it antony
 you shall read us the will caesar's will
antony will you be patient will you stay awhile
 i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
 i fear i wrong the honourable men
 whose daggers have stabb'd caesar i do fear it
fourth citizen they were traitors honourable men
all the will the testament
second citizen they were villains murderers the will read the will
antony you will compel me then to read the will
 then make a ring about the corpse of caesar
 and let me show you him that made the will
 shall i descend and will you give me leave
several citizens come down
second citizen descend
third citizen you shall have leave
 antony comes down
fourth citizen a ring stand round
first citizen stand from the hearse stand from the body
second citizen room for antony most noble antony
antony nay press not so upon me stand far off
several citizens stand back room bear back
antony if you have tears prepare to shed them now
 you all do know this mantle i remember
 the first time ever caesar put it on
 twas on a summer's evening in his tent
 that day he overcame the nervii
 look in this place ran cassius dagger through
 see what a rent the envious casca made
 through this the wellbeloved brutus stabb'd
 and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away
 mark how the blood of caesar follow'd it
 as rushing out of doors to be resolved
 if brutus so unkindly knock'd or no
 for brutus as you know was caesar's angel
 judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him
 this was the most unkindest cut of all
 for when the noble caesar saw him stab
 ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
 quite vanquish'd him then burst his mighty heart
 and in his mantle muffling up his face
 even at the base of pompey's statua
 which all the while ran blood great caesar fell
 o what a fall was there my countrymen
 then i and you and all of us fell down
 whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us
 o now you weep and i perceive you feel
 the dint of pity these are gracious drops
 kind souls what weep you when you but behold
 our caesar's vesture wounded look you here
 here is himself marr'd as you see with traitors
first citizen o piteous spectacle
second citizen o noble caesar
third citizen o woful day
fourth citizen o traitors villains
first citizen o most bloody sight
second citizen we will be revenged
all revenge about seek burn fire kill slay
 let not a traitor live
antony stay countrymen
first citizen peace there hear the noble antony
second citizen we'll hear him we'll follow him we'll die with him
antony good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
 to such a sudden flood of mutiny
 they that have done this deed are honourable
 what private griefs they have alas i know not
 that made them do it they are wise and honourable
 and will no doubt with reasons answer you
 i come not friends to steal away your hearts
 i am no orator as brutus is
 but as you know me all a plain blunt man
 that love my friend and that they know full well
 that gave me public leave to speak of him
 for i have neither wit nor words nor worth
 action nor utterance nor the power of speech
 to stir men's blood i only speak right on
 i tell you that which you yourselves do know
 show you sweet caesar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths
 and bid them speak for me but were i brutus
 and brutus antony there were an antony
 would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
 in every wound of caesar that should move
 the stones of rome to rise and mutiny
all we'll mutiny
first citizen we'll burn the house of brutus
third citizen away then come seek the conspirators
antony yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
all peace ho hear antony most noble antony
antony why friends you go to do you know not what
 wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves
 alas you know not i must tell you then
 you have forgot the will i told you of
all most true the will let's stay and hear the will
antony here is the will and under caesar's seal
 to every roman citizen he gives
 to every several man seventyfive drachmas
second citizen most noble caesar we'll revenge his death
third citizen o royal caesar
antony hear me with patience
all peace ho
antony moreover he hath left you all his walks
 his private arbours and newplanted orchards
 on this side tiber he hath left them you
 and to your heirs for ever common pleasures
 to walk abroad and recreate yourselves
 here was a caesar when comes such another

octavius your brother too must die consent you lepidus
lepidus i do consent
octavius prick him down antony
lepidus upon condition publius shall not live
 who is your sister's son mark antony
antony he shall not live look with a spot i damn him
 but lepidus go you to caesar's house
 fetch the will hither and we shall determine
 how to cut off some charge in legacies
lepidus what shall i find you here
octavius or here or at the capitol
 exit lepidus
antony this is a slight unmeritable man
 meet to be sent on errands is it fit
 the threefold world divided he should stand
 one of the three to share it
octavius so you thought him
 and took his voice who should be prick'd to die
 in our black sentence and proscription
antony octavius i have seen more days than you
 and though we lay these honours on this man
 to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
 he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
 to groan and sweat under the business
 either led or driven as we point the way
 and having brought our treasure where we will
 then take we down his load and turn him off
 like to the empty ass to shake his ears
 and graze in commons
octavius you may do your will
 but he's a tried and valiant soldier
antony so is my horse octavius and for that
 i do appoint him store of provender
 it is a creature that i teach to fight
 to wind to stop to run directly on
 his corporal motion govern'd by my spirit
 and in some taste is lepidus but so
 he must be taught and train'd and bid go forth
 a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds
 on abjects orts and imitations
 which out of use and staled by other men
 begin his fashion do not talk of him
 but as a property and now octavius
 listen great thingsbrutus and cassius
 are levying powers we must straight make head
 therefore let our alliance be combined
 our best friends made our means stretch'd
 and let us presently go sit in council
 how covert matters may be best disclosed
 and open perils surest answered
octavius let us do so for we are at the stake
 and bay'd about with many enemies
 and some that smile have in their hearts i fear
 millions of mischiefs

lucilius give the word ho and stand
brutus what now lucilius is cassius near
lucilius he is at hand and pindarus is come
 to do you salutation from his master
brutus he greets me well your master pindarus
 in his own change or by ill officers
 hath given me some worthy cause to wish
 things done undone but if he be at hand
 i shall be satisfied
pindarus i do not doubt
 but that my noble master will appear
 such as he is full of regard and honour
brutus he is not doubted a word lucilius
 how he received you let me be resolved
lucilius with courtesy and with respect enough
 but not with such familiar instances
 nor with such free and friendly conference
 as he hath used of old
brutus thou hast described
 a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius
 when love begins to sicken and decay
 it useth an enforced ceremony
 there are no tricks in plain and simple faith
 but hollow men like horses hot at hand
 make gallant show and promise of their mettle
 but when they should endure the bloody spur
 they fall their crests and like deceitful jades
 sink in the trial comes his army on
lucilius they mean this night in sardis to be quarter'd

cassius brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
 and when you do them
brutus cassius be content
 speak your griefs softly i do know you well
 before the eyes of both our armies here
 which should perceive nothing but love from us
 let us not wrangle bid them move away
 then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs
 and i will give you audience
cassius pindarus
 bid our commanders lead their charges off
 a little from this ground

scene iii brutus's tent
 enter brutus and cassius
cassius that you have wrong'd me doth appear in this
 you have condemn'd and noted lucius pella
 for taking bribes here of the sardians
 wherein my letters praying on his side
 because i knew the man were slighted off
brutus you wronged yourself to write in such a case
cassius in such a time as this it is not meet
 that every nice offence should bear his comment
brutus let me tell you cassius you yourself
 are much condemn'd to have an itching palm
 to sell and mart your offices for gold
 to undeservers
cassius i an itching palm
 you know that you are brutus that speak this
 or by the gods this speech were else your last
brutus the name of cassius honours this corruption
 and chastisement doth therefore hide his head
cassius chastisement
brutus remember march the ides of march remember
 did not great julius bleed for justice sake
 what villain touch'd his body that did stab
 and not for justice what shall one of us
 that struck the foremost man of all this world
 but for supporting robbers shall we now
 contaminate our fingers with base bribes
 and sell the mighty space of our large honours
 for so much trash as may be grasped thus
 i had rather be a dog and bay the moon
 than such a roman
cassius brutus bay not me
 i'll not endure it you forget yourself
 to hedge me in i am a soldier i
 older in practise abler than yourself
 to make conditions
brutus go to you are not cassius
cassius i am
brutus i say you are not
cassius urge me no more i shall forget myself
 have mind upon your health tempt me no further
brutus away slight man
cassius is't possible
brutus hear me for i will speak
 must i give way and room to your rash choler
 shall i be frighted when a madman stares
cassius o ye gods ye gods must i endure all this
brutus all this ay more fret till your proud heart break
 go show your slaves how choleric you are
 and make your bondmen tremble must i budge
 must i observe you must i stand and crouch
 under your testy humour by the gods
 you shall digest the venom of your spleen
 though it do split you for from this day forth
 i'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
 when you are waspish
cassius is it come to this
brutus you say you are a better soldier
 let it appear so make your vaunting true
 and it shall please me well for mine own part
 i shall be glad to learn of noble men
cassius you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus
 i said an elder soldier not a better
 did i say better'
brutus if you did i care not
cassius when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
brutus peace peace you durst not so have tempted him
cassius i durst not
brutus no
cassius what durst not tempt him
brutus for your life you durst not
cassius do not presume too much upon my love
 i may do that i shall be sorry for
brutus you have done that you should be sorry for
 there is no terror cassius in your threats
 for i am arm'd so strong in honesty
 that they pass by me as the idle wind
 which i respect not i did send to you
 for certain sums of gold which you denied me
 for i can raise no money by vile means
 by heaven i had rather coin my heart
 and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
 from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
 by any indirection i did send
 to you for gold to pay my legions
 which you denied me was that done like cassius
 should i have answer'd caius cassius so
 when marcus brutus grows so covetous
 to lock such rascal counters from his friends
 be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
 dash him to pieces
cassius i denied you not
brutus you did
cassius i did not he was but a fool that brought
 my answer back brutus hath rived my heart
 a friend should bear his friend's infirmities
 but brutus makes mine greater than they are
brutus i do not till you practise them on me
cassius you love me not
brutus i do not like your faults
cassius a friendly eye could never see such faults
brutus a flatterer's would not though they do appear
 as huge as high olympus
cassius come antony and young octavius come
 revenge yourselves alone on cassius
 for cassius is aweary of the world
 hated by one he loves braved by his brother
 cheque'd like a bondman all his faults observed
 set in a notebook learn'd and conn'd by rote
 to cast into my teeth o i could weep
 my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger
 and here my naked breast within a heart
 dearer than plutus mine richer than gold
 if that thou be'st a roman take it forth
 i that denied thee gold will give my heart
 strike as thou didst at caesar for i know
 when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
 than ever thou lovedst cassius
brutus sheathe your dagger
 be angry when you will it shall have scope
 do what you will dishonour shall be humour
 o cassius you are yoked with a lamb
 that carries anger as the flint bears fire
 who much enforced shows a hasty spark
 and straight is cold again
cassius hath cassius lived
 to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus
 when grief and blood illtemper'd vexeth him
brutus when i spoke that i was illtemper'd too
cassius do you confess so much give me your hand
brutus and my heart too
cassius o brutus
brutus what's the matter
cassius have not you love enough to bear with me
 when that rash humour which my mother gave me
 makes me forgetful
brutus yes cassius and from henceforth
 when you are overearnest with your brutus
 he'll think your mother chides and leave you so
poet within let me go in to see the generals
 there is some grudge between em tis not meet
 they be alone
lucilius within you shall not come to them
poet within nothing but death shall stay me
 enter poet followed by lucilius titinius and lucius
cassius how now what's the matter
poet for shame you generals what do you mean
 love and be friends as two such men should be
 for i have seen more years i'm sure than ye
cassius ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
brutus get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence

cassius i did not think you could have been so angry
brutus o cassius i am sick of many griefs
cassius of your philosophy you make no use

brutus no man bears sorrow better portia is dead
cassius ha portia
brutus she is dead
cassius how scaped i killing when i cross'd you so
 o insupportable and touching loss
 upon what sickness
brutus impatient of my absence
 and grief that young octavius with mark antony
 have made themselves so strongfor with her death
 that tidings camewith this she fell distract
 and her attendants absent swallow'd fire
cassius and died so
brutus even so
cassius o ye immortal gods
 reenter lucius with wine and taper
brutus speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine
 in this i bury all unkindness cassius
cassius my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
 fill lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup
 i cannot drink too much of brutus love
brutus come in titinius
 exit lucius
 reenter titinius with messala
 welcome good messala
 now sit we close about this taper here
 and call in question our necessities
cassius portia art thou gone
brutus no more i pray you
 messala i have here received letters
 that young octavius and mark antony
 come down upon us with a mighty power
 bending their expedition toward philippi
messala myself have letters of the selfsame tenor
brutus with what addition
messala that by proscription and bills of outlawry
 octavius antony and lepidus
 have put to death an hundred senators
brutus therein our letters do not well agree
 mine speak of seventy senators that died
 by their proscriptions cicero being one
cassius cicero one
messala cicero is dead
 and by that order of proscription
 had you your letters from your wife my lord
brutus no messala
messala nor nothing in your letters writ of her
brutus nothing messala
messala that methinks is strange
brutus why ask you hear you aught of her in yours
messala no my lord
brutus now as you are a roman tell me true
messala then like a roman bear the truth i tell
 for certain she is dead and by strange manner
brutus why farewell portia we must die messala
 with meditating that she must die once
 i have the patience to endure it now
messala even so great men great losses should endure
cassius i have as much of this in art as you
 but yet my nature could not bear it so
brutus well to our work alive what do you think
 of marching to philippi presently
cassius i do not think it good
brutus your reason
cassius this it is
 tis better that the enemy seek us
 so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
 doing himself offence whilst we lying still
 are full of rest defense and nimbleness
brutus good reasons must of force give place to better
 the people twixt philippi and this ground
 do stand but in a forced affection
 for they have grudged us contribution
 the enemy marching along by them
 by them shall make a fuller number up
 come on refresh'd newadded and encouraged
 from which advantage shall we cut him off
 if at philippi we do face him there
 these people at our back
cassius hear me good brother
brutus under your pardon you must note beside
 that we have tried the utmost of our friends
 our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe
 the enemy increaseth every day
 we at the height are ready to decline
 there is a tide in the affairs of men
 which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
 omitted all the voyage of their life
 is bound in shallows and in miseries
 on such a full sea are we now afloat
 and we must take the current when it serves
 or lose our ventures
cassius then with your will go on
 we'll along ourselves and meet them at philippi
brutus the deep of night is crept upon our talk
 and nature must obey necessity
 which we will niggard with a little rest
 there is no more to say
cassius no more good night
 early tomorrow will we rise and hence

 enter octavius antony and their army
octavius now antony our hopes are answered
 you said the enemy would not come down
 but keep the hills and upper regions
 it proves not so their battles are at hand
 they mean to warn us at philippi here
 answering before we do demand of them
antony tut i am in their bosoms and i know
 wherefore they do it they could be content
 to visit other places and come down
 with fearful bravery thinking by this face
 to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
 but tis not so
 enter a messenger
messenger prepare you generals
 the enemy comes on in gallant show
 their bloody sign of battle is hung out
 and something to be done immediately
antony octavius lead your battle softly on
 upon the left hand of the even field
octavius upon the right hand i keep thou the left
antony why do you cross me in this exigent
octavius i do not cross you but i will do so

 lucilius titinius messala and others
brutus they stand and would have parley
cassius stand fast titinius we must out and talk
octavius mark antony shall we give sign of battle
antony no caesar we will answer on their charge
 make forth the generals would have some words
octavius stir not until the signal
brutus words before blows is it so countrymen
octavius not that we love words better as you do
brutus good words are better than bad strokes octavius
antony in your bad strokes brutus you give good words
 witness the hole you made in caesar's heart
 crying long live hail caesar'
cassius antony
 the posture of your blows are yet unknown
 but for your words they rob the hybla bees
 and leave them honeyless
antony not stingless too
brutus o yes and soundless too
 for you have stol'n their buzzing antony
 and very wisely threat before you sting
antony villains you did not so when your vile daggers
 hack'd one another in the sides of caesar
 you show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds
 and bow'd like bondmen kissing caesar's feet
 whilst damned casca like a cur behind
 struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers
cassius flatterers now brutus thank yourself
 this tongue had not offended so today
 if cassius might have ruled
octavius come come the cause if arguing make us sweat
 the proof of it will turn to redder drops look
 i draw a sword against conspirators
 when think you that the sword goes up again
 never till caesar's three and thirty wounds
 be well avenged or till another caesar
 have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
brutus caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
 unless thou bring'st them with thee
octavius so i hope
 i was not born to die on brutus sword
brutus o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
 young man thou couldst not die more honourable
cassius a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour
 join'd with a masker and a reveller
antony old cassius still
octavius come antony away
 defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
 if you dare fight today come to the field
 if not when you have stomachs
 exeunt octavius antony and their army
cassius why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
 the storm is up and all is on the hazard
brutus ho lucilius hark a word with you
lucilius standing forth my lord
 brutus and lucilius converse apart
cassius messala
messala standing forth what says my general
cassius messala
 this is my birthday as this very day
 was cassius born give me thy hand messala
 be thou my witness that against my will
 as pompey was am i compell'd to set
 upon one battle all our liberties
 you know that i held epicurus strong
 and his opinion now i change my mind
 and partly credit things that do presage
 coming from sardis on our former ensign
 two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd
 gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
 who to philippi here consorted us
 this morning are they fled away and gone
 and in their steads do ravens crows and kites
 fly o'er our heads and downward look on us
 as we were sickly prey their shadows seem
 a canopy most fatal under which
 our army lies ready to give up the ghost
messala believe not so
cassius i but believe it partly
 for i am fresh of spirit and resolved
 to meet all perils very constantly
brutus even so lucilius
cassius now most noble brutus
 the gods today stand friendly that we may
 lovers in peace lead on our days to age
 but since the affairs of men rest still incertain
 let's reason with the worst that may befall
 if we do lose this battle then is this
 the very last time we shall speak together
 what are you then determined to do
brutus even by the rule of that philosophy
 by which i did blame cato for the death
 which he did give himself i know not how
 but i do find it cowardly and vile
 for fear of what might fall so to prevent
 the time of life arming myself with patience
 to stay the providence of some high powers
 that govern us below
cassius then if we lose this battle
 you are contented to be led in triumph
 thorough the streets of rome
brutus no cassius no think not thou noble roman
 that ever brutus will go bound to rome
 he bears too great a mind but this same day
 must end that work the ides of march begun
 and whether we shall meet again i know not
 therefore our everlasting farewell take
 for ever and for ever farewell cassius
 if we do meet again why we shall smile
 if not why then this parting was well made
cassius for ever and for ever farewell brutus
 if we do meet again we'll smile indeed
 if not tis true this parting was well made
brutus why then lead on o that a man might know
 the end of this day's business ere it come
 but it sufficeth that the day will end
 and then the end is known come ho away

 this ensign here of mine was turning back
 i slew the coward and did take it from him
titinius o cassius brutus gave the word too early
 who having some advantage on octavius
 took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
 whilst we by antony are all enclosed
 enter pindarus
pindarus fly further off my lord fly further off
 mark antony is in your tents my lord
 fly therefore noble cassius fly far off
cassius this hill is far enough look look titinius
 are those my tents where i perceive the fire
titinius they are my lord
cassius titinius if thou lovest me
 mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
 till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
 and here again that i may rest assured
 whether yond troops are friend or enemy
titinius i will be here again even with a thought
 exit
cassius go pindarus get higher on that hill
 my sight was ever thick regard titinius
 and tell me what thou notest about the field
 pindarus ascends the hill
 this day i breathed first time is come round
 and where i did begin there shall i end
 my life is run his compass sirrah what news
pindarus above o my lord
cassius what news
pindarus above titinius is enclosed round about
 with horsemen that make to him on the spur
 yet he spurs on now they are almost on him
 now titinius now some light o he lights too
 he's ta'en
 shout
 and hark they shout for joy
cassius come down behold no more
 o coward that i am to live so long
 to see my best friend ta'en before my face
 pindarus descends
 come hither sirrah
 in parthia did i take thee prisoner
 and then i swore thee saving of thy life
 that whatsoever i did bid thee do
 thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath
 now be a freeman and with this good sword
 that ran through caesar's bowels search this bosom
 stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
 and when my face is cover'd as tis now
 guide thou the sword
 pindarus stabs him
 caesar thou art revenged
 even with the sword that kill'd thee
 dies
pindarus so i am free yet would not so have been
 durst i have done my will o cassius
 far from this country pindarus shall run
 where never roman shall take note of him
 exit
 reenter titinius with messala
messala it is but change titinius for octavius
 is overthrown by noble brutus power
 as cassius legions are by antony
titinius these tidings will well comfort cassius
messala where did you leave him
titinius all disconsolate
 with pindarus his bondman on this hill
messala is not that he that lies upon the ground
titinius he lies not like the living o my heart
messala is not that he
titinius no this was he messala
 but cassius is no more o setting sun
 as in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight
 so in his red blood cassius day is set
 the sun of rome is set our day is gone
 clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
 mistrust of my success hath done this deed
messala mistrust of good success hath done this deed
 o hateful error melancholy's child
 why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men

gloucester it did always seem so to us but now in the
 division of the kingdom it appears not which of
 the dukes he values most for equalities are so
 weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice
 of either's moiety
kent is not this your son my lord
gloucester his breeding sir hath been at my charge i have
 so often blushed to acknowledge him that now i am
 brazed to it
kent i cannot conceive you
gloucester sir this young fellow's mother could whereupon
 she grew roundwombed and had indeed sir a son
 for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed
 do you smell a fault
kent i cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it
 being so proper
gloucester but i have sir a son by order of law some year
 elder than this who yet is no dearer in my account
 though this knave came something saucily into the
 world before he was sent for yet was his mother
 fair there was good sport at his making and the
 whoreson must be acknowledged do you know this

 to shake all cares and business from our age
 conferring them on younger strengths while we
 unburthen'd crawl toward death our son of cornwall
 and you our no less loving son of albany
 we have this hour a constant will to publish
 our daughters several dowers that future strife
 may be prevented now the princes france and burgundy
 great rivals in our youngest daughter's love
 long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
 and here are to be answer'd tell me my daughters
 since now we will divest us both of rule
 interest of territory cares of state
 which of you shall we say doth love us most
 that we our largest bounty may extend
 where nature doth with merit challenge goneril
 our eldestborn speak first
goneril sir i love you more than words can wield the matter
 dearer than eyesight space and liberty
 beyond what can be valued rich or rare
 no less than life with grace health beauty honour
 as much as child e'er loved or father found
 a love that makes breath poor and speech unable
 beyond all manner of so much i love you
cordelia aside what shall cordelia do
 love and be silent
lear of all these bounds even from this line to this
 with shadowy forests and with champains rich'd
 with plenteous rivers and wideskirted meads
 we make thee lady to thine and albany's issue
 be this perpetual what says our second daughter
 our dearest regan wife to cornwall speak
regan sir i am made
 of the selfsame metal that my sister is
 and prize me at her worth in my true heart
 i find she names my very deed of love
 only she comes too short that i profess
 myself an enemy to all other joys
 which the most precious square of sense possesses
 and find i am alone felicitate
 in your dear highness love
cordelia aside then poor cordelia
 and yet not so since i am sure my love's
 more richer than my tongue
king lear to thee and thine hereditary ever
 remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
 no less in space validity and pleasure
 than that conferr'd on goneril now our joy
 although the last not least to whose young love
 the vines of france and milk of burgundy
 strive to be interess'd what can you say to draw
 a third more opulent than your sisters speak
cordelia nothing my lord
king lear nothing
cordelia nothing
king lear nothing will come of nothing speak again
cordelia unhappy that i am i cannot heave
 my heart into my mouth i love your majesty
 according to my bond nor more nor less
king lear how how cordelia mend your speech a little
 lest it may mar your fortunes
cordelia good my lord
 you have begot me bred me loved me i
 return those duties back as are right fit
 obey you love you and most honour you
 why have my sisters husbands if they say
 they love you all haply when i shall wed
 that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
 half my love with him half my care and duty
 sure i shall never marry like my sisters
 to love my father all

king lear so young and so untender
cordelia so young my lord and true
king lear let it be so thy truth then be thy dower
 for by the sacred radiance of the sun
 the mysteries of hecate and the night
 by all the operation of the orbs
 from whom we do exist and cease to be
 here i disclaim all my paternal care
 propinquity and property of blood
 and as a stranger to my heart and me
 hold thee from this for ever the barbarous scythian
 or he that makes his generation messes
 to gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
 be as well neighbour'd pitied and relieved
 as thou my sometime daughter
kent good my liege

 i loved her most and thought to set my rest
 on her kind nursery hence and avoid my sight
 so be my grave my peace as here i give

 let pride which she calls plainness marry her
 i do invest you jointly with my power

king lear the bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft
kent let it fall rather though the fork invade

 when lear is mad what wilt thou do old man
 think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
 when power to flattery bows to plainness honour's bound
 when majesty stoops to folly reverse thy doom

 thy youngest daughter does not love thee least

 reverbs no hollowness

 which we durst never yet and with strain'd pride

 to shield thee from diseases of the world

 burgundy and attendants
gloucester here's france and burgundy my noble lord
king lear my lord of burgundy
 we first address towards you who with this king
 hath rivall'd for our daughter what in the least
 will you require in present dower with her
 or cease your quest of love
burgundy most royal majesty
 i crave no more than what your highness offer'd
 nor will you tender less
king lear right noble burgundy
 when she was dear to us we did hold her so
 but now her price is fall'n sir there she stands
 if aught within that little seeming substance
 or all of it with our displeasure pieced
 and nothing more may fitly like your grace
 she's there and she is yours
burgundy i know no answer
king lear will you with those infirmities she owes
 unfriended newadopted to our hate
 dower'd with our curse and stranger'd with our oath
 take her or leave her
burgundy pardon me royal sir
 election makes not up on such conditions
king lear then leave her sir for by the power that made me
 i tell you all her wealth
 to king of france
 for you great king
 i would not from your love make such a stray
 to match you where i hate therefore beseech you
 to avert your liking a more worthier way
 than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
 almost to acknowledge hers
king of france this is most strange
 that she that even but now was your best object
 the argument of your praise balm of your age
 most best most dearest should in this trice of time
 commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
 so many folds of favour sure her offence
 must be of such unnatural degree
 that monsters it or your forevouch'd affection
 fall'n into taint which to believe of her
 must be a faith that reason without miracle
 could never plant in me
cordelia i yet beseech your majesty
 if for i want that glib and oily art
 to speak and purpose not since what i well intend
 i'll do't before i speakthat you make known
 it is no vicious blot murder or foulness
 no unchaste action or dishonour'd step
 that hath deprived me of your grace and favour
 but even for want of that for which i am richer
 a stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue
 as i am glad i have not though not to have it
 hath lost me in your liking
king lear better thou
 hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better
king of france is it but thisa tardiness in nature
 which often leaves the history unspoke
 that it intends to do my lord of burgundy
 what say you to the lady love's not love
 when it is mingled with regards that stand
 aloof from the entire point will you have her
 she is herself a dowry
burgundy royal lear
 give but that portion which yourself proposed
 and here i take cordelia by the hand
 duchess of burgundy
king lear nothing i have sworn i am firm
burgundy i am sorry then you have so lost a father
 that you must lose a husband
cordelia peace be with burgundy
 since that respects of fortune are his love
 i shall not be his wife
king of france fairest cordelia that art most rich being poor
 most choice forsaken and most loved despised
 thee and thy virtues here i seize upon
 be it lawful i take up what's cast away
 gods gods tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
 my love should kindle to inflamed respect
 thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance
 is queen of us of ours and our fair france
 not all the dukes of waterish burgundy
 can buy this unprized precious maid of me
 bid them farewell cordelia though unkind
 thou losest here a better where to find
king lear thou hast her france let her be thine for we
 have no such daughter nor shall ever see
 that face of hers again therefore be gone
 without our grace our love our benison
 come noble burgundy
 flourish exeunt all but king of france goneril
 regan and cordelia
king of france bid farewell to your sisters
cordelia the jewels of our father with wash'd eyes
 cordelia leaves you i know you what you are
 and like a sister am most loath to call
 your faults as they are named use well our father
 to your professed bosoms i commit him
 but yet alas stood i within his grace
 i would prefer him to a better place
 so farewell to you both
regan prescribe not us our duties
goneril let your study
 be to content your lord who hath received you
 at fortune's alms you have obedience scanted
 and well are worth the want that you have wanted
cordelia time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides
 who cover faults at last shame them derides
 well may you prosper
king of france come my fair cordelia
 exeunt king of france and cordelia
goneril sister it is not a little i have to say of what
 most nearly appertains to us both i think our
 father will hence tonight
regan that's most certain and with you next month with us
goneril you see how full of changes his age is the
 observation we have made of it hath not been
 little he always loved our sister most and
 with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
 appears too grossly
regan tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever
 but slenderly known himself
goneril the best and soundest of his time hath been but
 rash then must we look to receive from his age
 not alone the imperfections of longengraffed
 condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness
 that infirm and choleric years bring with them
regan such unconstant starts are we like to have from
 him as this of kent's banishment
goneril there is further compliment of leavetaking
 between france and him pray you let's hit
 together if our father carry authority with
 such dispositions as he bears this last
 surrender of his will but offend us
regan we shall further think on't
goneril we must do something and i the heat

edmund i know no news my lord
gloucester what paper were you reading
edmund nothing my lord
gloucester no what needed then that terrible dispatch of
 it into your pocket the quality of nothing hath
 not such need to hide itself let's see come
 if it be nothing i shall not need spectacles
edmund i beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter
 from my brother that i have not all o'erread
 and for so much as i have perused i find it not
 fit for your o'erlooking
gloucester give me the letter sir
edmund i shall offend either to detain or give it the
 contents as in part i understand them are to blame
gloucester let's see let's see
edmund i hope for my brother's justification he wrote
 this but as an essay or taste of my virtue
gloucester reads this policy and reverence of age makes
 the world bitter to the best of our times keeps
 our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
 them i begin to find an idle and fond bondage
 in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not
 as it hath power but as it is suffered come to
 me that of this i may speak more if our father
 would sleep till i waked him you should half his
 revenue for ever and live the beloved of your
 brother edgar'

 should enjoy half his revenue'my son edgar
 had he a hand to write this a heart and brain

 brought it
edmund it was not brought me my lord there's the
 cunning of it i found it thrown in at the
 casement of my closet
gloucester you know the character to be your brother's
edmund if the matter were good my lord i durst swear
 it were his but in respect of that i would
 fain think it were not
gloucester it is his
edmund it is his hand my lord but i hope his heart is
 not in the contents
gloucester hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business
edmund never my lord but i have heard him oft
 maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age
 and fathers declining the father should be as
 ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
gloucester o villain villain his very opinion in the
 letter abhorred villain unnatural detested
 brutish villain worse than brutish go sirrah
 seek him i'll apprehend him abominable villain
 where is he
edmund i do not well know my lord if it shall please
 you to suspend your indignation against my
 brother till you can derive from him better
 testimony of his intent you shall run a certain
 course where if you violently proceed against
 him mistaking his purpose it would make a great
 gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the
 heart of his obedience i dare pawn down my life
 for him that he hath wrote this to feel my
 affection to your honour and to no further
 pretence of danger
gloucester think you so
edmund if your honour judge it meet i will place you
 where you shall hear us confer of this and by an
 auricular assurance have your satisfaction and
 that without any further delay than this very evening
gloucester he cannot be such a monster

 business after your own wisdom i would unstate
 myself to be in a due resolution
edmund i will seek him sir presently convey the
 business as i shall find means and acquaint you withal
gloucester these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend

 reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself
 scourged by the sequent effects love cools

 forbearance till the spied of his rage goes

 renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks
 with every gale and vary of their masters
 knowing nought like dogs but following

kent his countenance likes me not
cornwall no more perchance does mine nor his nor hers
kent sir tis my occupation to be plain
 i have seen better faces in my time
 than stands on any shoulder that i see
 before me at this instant
cornwall this is some fellow
 who having been praised for bluntness doth affect
 a saucy roughness and constrains the garb
 quite from his nature he cannot flatter he
 an honest mind and plain he must speak truth
 an they will take it so if not he's plain
 these kind of knaves i know which in this plainness
 harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
 than twenty silly ducking observants
 that stretch their duties nicely
kent sir in good sooth in sincere verity
 under the allowance of your great aspect
 whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire
 on flickering phoebus front
cornwall what mean'st by this
kent to go out of my dialect which you
 discommend so much i know sir i am no
 flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain
 accent was a plain knave which for my part
 i will not be though i should win your displeasure
 to entreat me to t
cornwall what was the offence you gave him
oswald i never gave him any
 it pleased the king his master very late
 to strike at me upon his misconstruction
 when he conjunct and flattering his displeasure
 tripp'd me behind being down insulted rail'd
 and put upon him such a deal of man
 that worthied him got praises of the king
 for him attempting who was selfsubdued
 and in the fleshment of this dread exploit
 drew on me here again
kent none of these rogues and cowards
 but ajax is their fool
cornwall fetch forth the stocks
 you stubborn ancient knave you reverend braggart
 we'll teach you
kent sir i am too old to learn
 call not your stocks for me i serve the king
 on whose employment i was sent to you
 you shall do small respect show too bold malice
 against the grace and person of my master
 stocking his messenger
cornwall fetch forth the stocks as i have life and honour
 there shall he sit till noon
regan till noon till night my lord and all night too
kent why madam if i were your father's dog
 you should not use me so
regan sir being his knave i will
cornwall this is a fellow of the selfsame colour
 our sister speaks of come bring away the stocks
 stocks brought out
gloucester let me beseech your grace not to do so
 his fault is much and the good king his master
 will cheque him for t your purposed low correction
 is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
 for pilferings and most common trespasses
 are punish'd with the king must take it ill
 that he's so slightly valued in his messenger
 should have him thus restrain'd
cornwall i'll answer that
regan my sister may receive it much more worse
 to have her gentleman abused assaulted
 for following her affairs put in his legs
 kent is put in the stocks
 come my good lord away
 exeunt all but gloucester and kent
gloucester i am sorry for thee friend tis the duke's pleasure

scene iii a wood
 enter edgar
edgar i heard myself proclaim'd
 and by the happy hollow of a tree
 escaped the hunt no port is free no place
 that guard and most unusual vigilance
 does not attend my taking whiles i may scape
 i will preserve myself and am bethought
 to take the basest and most poorest shape
 that ever penury in contempt of man
 brought near to beast my face i'll grime with filth
 blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots
 and with presented nakedness outface
 the winds and persecutions of the sky
 the country gives me proof and precedent
 of bedlam beggars who with roaring voices
 strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
 pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary
 and with this horrible object from low farms
 poor pelting villages sheepcotes and mills
 sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers
 enforce their charity poor turlygod poor tom
 that's something yet edgar i nothing am

scene iv before gloucester's castle kent in the stocks
 enter king lear fool and gentleman
king lear tis strange that they should so depart from home
 and not send back my messenger
gentleman as i learn'd
 the night before there was no purpose in them
 of this remove
kent hail to thee noble master
king lear ha
 makest thou this shame thy pastime
kent no my lord
fool ha ha he wears cruel garters horses are tied
 by the heads dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by
 the loins and men by the legs when a man's
 overlusty at legs then he wears wooden
 netherstocks
king lear what's he that hath so much thy place mistook
 to set thee here
kent it is both he and she
 your son and daughter
king lear no
kent yes
king lear no i say
kent i say yea
king lear no no they would not
kent yes they have
king lear by jupiter i swear no
kent by juno i swear ay
king lear they durst not do t
 they could not would not do t tis worse than murder
 to do upon respect such violent outrage
 resolve me with all modest haste which way
 thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage
 coming from us
kent my lord when at their home
 i did commend your highness letters to them
 ere i was risen from the place that show'd
 my duty kneeling came there a reeking post
 stew'd in his haste half breathless panting forth
 from goneril his mistress salutations
 deliver'd letters spite of intermission
 which presently they read on whose contents
 they summon'd up their meiny straight took horse
 commanded me to follow and attend
 the leisure of their answer gave me cold looks
 and meeting here the other messenger
 whose welcome i perceived had poison'd mine
 being the very fellow that of late
 display'd so saucily against your highness
 having more man than wit about me drew
 he raised the house with loud and coward cries
 your son and daughter found this trespass worth
 the shame which here it suffers
fool winter's not gone yet if the wildgeese fly that way
 fathers that wear rags
 do make their children blind
 but fathers that bear bags
 shall see their children kind
 fortune that arrant whore
 ne'er turns the key to the poor
 but for all this thou shalt have as many dolours
 for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year
king lear o how this mother swells up toward my heart
 hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow

fool and thou hadst been set i the stocks for that
 question thou hadst well deserved it
kent why fool
fool we'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee
 there's no labouring i the winter all that follow
 their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and
 there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
 that's stinking let go thy hold when a great wheel
 runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with
 following it but the great one that goes up the
 hill let him draw thee after when a wise man
 gives thee better counsel give me mine again i
 would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
 that sir which serves and seeks for gain
 and follows but for form
 will pack when it begins to rain
 and leave thee in the storm
 but i will tarry the fool will stay
 and let the wise man fly
 the knave turns fool that runs away
 the fool no knave perdy
kent where learned you this fool
fool not i the stocks fool

 on her ingrateful top strike her young bones
 you taking airs with lameness
cornwall fie sir fie
king lear you nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames
 into her scornful eyes infect her beauty
 you fensuck'd fogs drawn by the powerful sun
 to fall and blast her pride
regan o the blest gods so will you wish on me
 when the rash mood is on
king lear no regan thou shalt never have my curse
 thy tenderhefted nature shall not give
 thee o'er to harshness her eyes are fierce but thine
 do comfort and not burn tis not in thee
 to grudge my pleasures to cut off my train
 to bandy hasty words to scant my sizes
 and in conclusion to oppose the bolt
 against my coming in thou better know'st
 the offices of nature bond of childhood
 effects of courtesy dues of gratitude
 thy half o the kingdom hast thou not forgot
 wherein i thee endow'd
regan good sir to the purpose
king lear who put my man i the stocks

goneril why not by the hand sir how have i offended
 all's not offence that indiscretion finds
 and dotage terms so
king lear o sides you are too tough

cornwall i set him there sir but his own disorders

 you will return and sojourn with my sister
 dismissing half your train come then to me
 i am now from home and out of that provision
 which shall be needful for your entertainment
king lear return to her and fifty men dismiss'd
 no rather i abjure all roofs and choose
 to wage against the enmity o the air
 to be a comrade with the wolf and owl
 necessity's sharp pinch return with her
 why the hotblooded france that dowerless took
 our youngest born i could as well be brought
 to knee his throne and squirelike pension beg
 to keep base life afoot return with her
 persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
 to this detested groom
 pointing at oswald
goneril at your choice sir
king lear i prithee daughter do not make me mad
 i will not trouble thee my child farewell
 we'll no more meet no more see one another
 but yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter
 or rather a disease that's in my flesh
 which i must needs call mine thou art a boil
 a plaguesore an embossed carbuncle
 in my corrupted blood but i'll not chide thee
 let shame come when it will i do not call it
 i do not bid the thunderbearer shoot
 nor tell tales of thee to highjudging jove
 mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
 i can be patient i can stay with regan
 i and my hundred knights
regan not altogether so
 i look'd not for you yet nor am provided
 for your fit welcome give ear sir to my sister
 for those that mingle reason with your passion
 must be content to think you old and so
 but she knows what she does
king lear is this well spoken
regan i dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
 is it not well what should you need of more
 yea or so many sith that both charge and danger
 speak gainst so great a number how in one house
 should many people under two commands
 hold amity tis hard almost impossible
goneril why might not you my lord receive attendance
 from those that she calls servants or from mine
regan why not my lord if then they chanced to slack you
 we could control them if you will come to me
 for now i spy a dangeri entreat you
 to bring but five and twenty to no more

 what need you five and twenty ten or five
 to follow in a house where twice so many
 have a command to tend you
regan what need one
king lear o reason not the need our basest beggars
 are in the poorest thing superfluous
 allow not nature more than nature needs
 man's life's as cheap as beast's thou art a lady
 if only to go warm were gorgeous
 why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st
 which scarcely keeps thee warm but for true need
 you heavens give me that patience patience i need

 against their father fool me not so much
 to bear it tamely touch me with noble anger
 and let not women's weapons waterdrops

 i will have such revenges on you both
 that all the world shalli will do such things
 what they are yet i know not but they shall be
 the terrors of the earth you think i'll weep

 when every case in law is right
 no squire in debt nor no poor knight
 when slanders do not live in tongues
 nor cutpurses come not to throngs
 when usurers tell their gold i the field

 then shall the realm of albion
 come to great confusion
 then comes the time who lives to see't

edgar come on sir here's the place stand still how fearful

 the crows and choughs that wing the midway air
 show scarce so gross as beetles half way down
 hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade
 methinks he seems no bigger than his head
 the fishermen that walk upon the beach
 appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
 diminish'd to her cock her cock a buoy
 almost too small for sight the murmuring surge
 that on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes
 cannot be heard so high i'll look no more
 lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
 topple down headlong

 burn itself out if edgar live o bless him
 now fellow fare thee well
 he falls forward
edgar gone sir farewell
 and yet i know not how conceit may rob
 the treasury of life when life itself
 yields to the theft had he been where he thought
 by this had thought been past alive or dead

albany sir you have shown today your valiant strain
 and fortune led you well you have the captives
 that were the opposites of this day's strife
 we do require them of you so to use them
 as we shall find their merits and our safety
 may equally determine
edmund sir i thought it fit
 to send the old and miserable king
 to some retention and appointed guard
 whose age has charms in it whose title more
 to pluck the common bosom on his side
 an turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
 which do command them with him i sent the queen
 my reason all the same and they are ready
 tomorrow or at further space to appear
 where you shall hold your session at this time
 we sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend
 and the best quarrels in the heat are cursed
 by those that feel their sharpness
 the question of cordelia and her father
 requires a fitter place
albany sir by your patience
 i hold you but a subject of this war
 not as a brother

 more than in your addition

 i do forgive thee
edgar let's exchange charity
 i am no less in blood than thou art edmund
 if more the more thou hast wrong'd me
 my name is edgar and thy father's son
 the gods are just and of our pleasant vices
 make instruments to plague us
 the dark and vicious place where thee he got
 cost him his eyes
edmund thou hast spoken right tis true
 the wheel is come full circle i am here
albany methought thy very gait did prophesy
 a royal nobleness i must embrace thee
 let sorrow split my heart if ever i
 did hate thee or thy father
edgar worthy prince i know't
albany where have you hid yourself
 how have you known the miseries of your father
edgar by nursing them my lord list a brief tale
 and when tis told o that my heart would burst
 the bloody proclamation to escape
 that follow'd me so nearo our lives sweetness
 that we the pain of death would hourly die
 rather than die at oncetaught me to shift
 into a madman's rags to assume a semblance
 that very dogs disdain'd and in this habit
 met i my father with his bleeding rings
 their precious stones new lost became his guide
 led him begg'd for him saved him from despair
 nevero faultreveal'd myself unto him
 until some halfhour past when i was arm'd
 not sure though hoping of this good success
 i ask'd his blessing and from first to last
 told him my pilgrimage but his flaw'd heart
 alack too weak the conflict to support
 twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief
 burst smilingly
edmund this speech of yours hath moved me
 and shall perchance do good but speak you on
 you look as you had something more to say
albany if there be more more woeful hold it in
 for i am almost ready to dissolve
 hearing of this
edgar this would have seem'd a period
 to such as love not sorrow but another
 to amplify too much would make much more
 and top extremity
 whilst i was big in clamour came there in a man
 who having seen me in my worst estate
 shunn'd my abhorr'd society but then finding
 who twas that so endured with his strong arms
 he fastened on my neck and bellow'd out
 as he'ld burst heaven threw him on my father
 told the most piteous tale of lear and him
 that ever ear received which in recounting
 his grief grew puissant and the strings of life
 began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded
 and there i left him tranced

 follow'd his enemy king and did him service
 improper for a slave

 and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
 show'd like a rebel's whore but all's too weak
 for brave macbethwell he deserves that name
 disdaining fortune with his brandish'd steel
 which smoked with bloody execution
 like valour's minion carved out his passage
 till he faced the slave
 which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him
 till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps
 and fix'd his head upon our battlements
duncan o valiant cousin worthy gentleman
sergeant as whence the sun gins his reflection
 shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
 so from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
 discomfort swells mark king of scotland mark
 no sooner justice had with valour arm'd

 with furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
 began a fresh assault

 that man may question you seem to understand me

macbeth speak if you can what are you
first witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of glamis
second witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor
third witch all hail macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter
banquo good sir why do you start and seem to fear
 things that do sound so fair i the name of truth
 are ye fantastical or that indeed
 which outwardly ye show my noble partner
 you greet with present grace and great prediction
 of noble having and of royal hope
 that he seems rapt withal to me you speak not
 if you can look into the seeds of time
 and say which grain will grow and which will not
 speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
 your favours nor your hate
first witch hail
second witch hail

first witch lesser than macbeth and greater
second witch not so happy yet much happier
third witch thou shalt get kings though thou be none
 so all hail macbeth and banquo
first witch banquo and macbeth all hail
macbeth stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
 by sinel's death i know i am thane of glamis
 but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives
 a prosperous gentleman and to be king
 stands not within the prospect of belief
 no more than to be cawdor say from whence
 you owe this strange intelligence or why
 upon this blasted heath you stop our way
 with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you
 witches vanish
banquo the earth hath bubbles as the water has
 and these are of them whither are they vanish'd
macbeth into the air and what seem'd corporal melted
 as breath into the wind would they had stay'd
banquo were such things here as we do speak about
 or have we eaten on the insane root
 that takes the reason prisoner
macbeth your children shall be kings
banquo you shall be king
macbeth and thane of cawdor too went it not so
banquo to the selfsame tune and words who's here
 enter ross and angus
ross the king hath happily received macbeth
 the news of thy success and when he reads
 thy personal venture in the rebels fight
 his wonders and his praises do contend
 which should be thine or his silenced with that
 in viewing o'er the rest o the selfsame day
 he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks
 nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
 strange images of death as thick as hail
 came post with post and every one did bear
 thy praises in his kingdom's great defence
 and pour'd them down before him
angus we are sent
 to give thee from our royal master thanks
 only to herald thee into his sight
 not pay thee
ross and for an earnest of a greater honour
 he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor
 in which addition hail most worthy thane
 for it is thine
banquo what can the devil speak true
macbeth the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me
 in borrow'd robes
angus who was the thane lives yet
 but under heavy judgment bears that life
 which he deserves to lose whether he was combined
 with those of norway or did line the rebel
 with hidden help and vantage or that with both
 he labour'd in his country's wreck i know not
 but treasons capital confess'd and proved
 have overthrown him
macbeth aside glamis and thane of cawdor
 the greatest is behind
 to ross and angus
 thanks for your pains
 to banquo
 do you not hope your children shall be kings
 when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me
 promised no less to them
banquo that trusted home
 might yet enkindle you unto the crown
 besides the thane of cawdor but tis strange
 and oftentimes to win us to our harm
 the instruments of darkness tell us truths
 win us with honest trifles to betray's
 in deepest consequence
 cousins a word i pray you
macbeth aside two truths are told
 as happy prologues to the swelling act
 of the imperial themei thank you gentlemen
 aside this supernatural soliciting
 cannot be ill cannot be good if ill
 why hath it given me earnest of success
 commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor
 if good why do i yield to that suggestion
 whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
 and make my seated heart knock at my ribs
 against the use of nature present fears
 are less than horrible imaginings
 my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
 shakes so my single state of man that function
 is smother'd in surmise and nothing is
 but what is not
banquo look how our partner's rapt
macbeth aside if chance will have me king why chance may crown me
 without my stir
banquo new horrors come upon him
 like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
 but with the aid of use
macbeth aside come what come may
 time and the hour runs through the roughest day
banquo worthy macbeth we stay upon your leisure
macbeth give me your favour my dull brain was wrought
 with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains
 are register'd where every day i turn
 the leaf to read them let us toward the king
 think upon what hath chanced and at more time
 the interim having weigh'd it let us speak

 golden opinions from all sorts of people
 which would be worn now in their newest gloss

 wherein you dress'd yourself hath it slept since

 be so much more the man nor time nor place
 did then adhere and yet you would make both
 they have made themselves and that their fitness now
 does unmake you i have given suck and know
 how tender tis to love the babe that milks me
 i would while it was smiling in my face
 have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums

 have done to this
macbeth if we should fail

 shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
 a limbeck only when in swinish sleep
 their drenched natures lie as in a death

 we would spend it in some words upon that business

 proceeding from the heatoppressed brain
 i see thee yet in form as palpable
 as this which now i draw
 thou marshall'st me the way that i was going
 and such an instrument i was to use
 mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses
 or else worth all the rest i see thee still
 and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
 which was not so before there's no such thing
 it is the bloody business which informs
 thus to mine eyes now o'er the one halfworld
 nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
 the curtain'd sleep witchcraft celebrates
 pale hecate's offerings and wither'd murder
 alarum'd by his sentinel the wolf
 whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace
 with tarquin's ravishing strides towards his design
 moves like a ghost thou sure and firmset earth
 hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
 thy very stones prate of my whereabout
 and take the present horror from the time
 which now suits with it whiles i threat he lives
 words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
 a bell rings
 i go and it is done the bell invites me
 hear it not duncan for it is a knell

 murder'
 that they did wake each other i stood and heard them
 but they did say their prayers and address'd them
 again to sleep
lady macbeth there are two lodged together
macbeth one cried god bless us and amen the other
 as they had seen me with these hangman's hands
 listening their fear i could not say amen'
 when they did say god bless us'
lady macbeth consider it not so deeply
macbeth but wherefore could not i pronounce amen'
 i had most need of blessing and amen'
 stuck in my throat
lady macbeth these deeds must not be thought
 after these ways so it will make us mad
macbeth methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more
 macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep
 sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care
 the death of each day's life sore labour's bath
 balm of hurt minds great nature's second course
 chief nourisher in life's feast
lady macbeth what do you mean
macbeth still it cried sleep no more to all the house
 glamis hath murder'd sleep and therefore cawdor
 shall sleep no more macbeth shall sleep no more'
lady macbeth who was it that thus cried why worthy thane
 you do unbend your noble strength to think
 so brainsickly of things go get some water

 i'll gild the faces of the grooms withal
 for it must seem their guilt

 enter macduff and lennox
macduff was it so late friend ere you went to bed
 that you do lie so late
porter faith sir we were carousing till the
 second cock and drink sir is a great
 provoker of three things
macduff what three things does drink especially provoke
porter marry sir nosepainting sleep and
 urine lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes
 it provokes the desire but it takes
 away the performance therefore much drink
 may be said to be an equivocator with lechery
 it makes him and it mars him it sets
 him on and it takes him off it persuades him
 and disheartens him makes him stand to and
 not stand to in conclusion equivocates him
 in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him
macduff i believe drink gave thee the lie last night
porter that it did sir i the very throat on
 me but i requited him for his lie and i
 think being too strong for him though he took
 up my legs sometime yet i made a shift to cast
 him
macduff is thy master stirring
 enter macbeth
 our knocking has awaked him here he comes
lennox good morrow noble sir

macduff i'll make so bold to call
 for tis my limited service
 exit
lennox goes the king hence today
macbeth he does he did appoint so
lennox the night has been unruly where we lay
 our chimneys were blown down and as they say
 lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death
 and prophesying with accents terrible
 of dire combustion and confused events
 new hatch'd to the woeful time the obscure bird
 clamour'd the livelong night some say the earth
 was feverous and did shake
macbeth twas a rough night
lennox my young remembrance cannot parallel
 a fellow to it
 reenter macduff
macduff o horror horror horror tongue nor heart
 cannot conceive nor name thee
macbeth 
 what's the matter

macduff confusion now hath made his masterpiece
 most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
 the lord's anointed temple and stole thence
 the life o the building

 with a new gorgon do not bid me speak

 exeunt macbeth and lennox

 to countenance this horror ring the bell
 bell rings

lady macbeth what's the business
 that such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
 the sleepers of the house speak speak

 dear duff i prithee contradict thyself
 and say it is not so
 reenter macbeth and lennox with ross
macbeth had i but died an hour before this chance
 i had lived a blessed time for from this instant
 there s nothing serious in mortality
 all is but toys renown and grace is dead
 the wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
 is left this vault to brag of
 enter malcolm and donalbain
donalbain what is amiss
macbeth you are and do not know't
 the spring the head the fountain of your blood
 is stopp'd the very source of it is stopp'd
macduff your royal father s murder'd
malcolm o by whom
lennox those of his chamber as it seem'd had done t
 their hands and faces were an badged with blood
 so were their daggers which unwiped we found
 upon their pillows
 they stared and were distracted no man's life
 was to be trusted with them
macbeth o yet i do repent me of my fury
 that i did kill them
macduff wherefore did you so
macbeth who can be wise amazed temperate and furious
 loyal and neutral in a moment no man
 the expedition my violent love
 outrun the pauser reason here lay duncan
 his silver skin laced with his golden blood
 and his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
 for ruin's wasteful entrance there the murderers
 steep'd in the colours of their trade their daggers
 unmannerly breech'd with gore who could refrain
 that had a heart to love and in that heart
 courage to make s love known
lady macbeth help me hence ho
macduff look to the lady
malcolm aside to donalbain why do we hold our tongues
 that most may claim this argument for ours
donalbain aside to malcolm what should be spoken here
 where our fate
 hid in an augerhole may rush and seize us
 let s away
 our tears are not yet brew'd
malcolm aside to donalbain nor our strong sorrow
 upon the foot of motion
banquo look to the lady
 lady macbeth is carried out
 and when we have our naked frailties hid
 that suffer in exposure let us meet
 and question this most bloody piece of work
 to know it further fears and scruples shake us
 in the great hand of god i stand and thence
 against the undivulged pretence i fight
 of treasonous malice
macduff and so do i
all so all
macbeth let's briefly put on manly readiness
 and meet i the hall together
all well contented
 exeunt all but malcolm and donalbain
malcolm what will you do let's not consort with them
 to show an unfelt sorrow is an office
 which the false man does easy i'll to england
donalbain to ireland i our separated fortune
 shall keep us both the safer where we are
 there's daggers in men's smiles the near in blood
 the nearer bloody
malcolm this murderous shaft that's shot
 hath not yet lighted and our safest way
 is to avoid the aim therefore to horse
 and let us not be dainty of leavetaking
 but shift away there's warrant in that theft
 which steals itself when there's no mercy left

act ii
scene iv outside macbeth's castle
 enter ross and an old man
old man threescore and ten i can remember well
 within the volume of which time i have seen
 hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
 hath trifled former knowings
ross ah good father
 thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act
 threaten his bloody stage by the clock tis day
 and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
 is't night's predominance or the day's shame
 that darkness does the face of earth entomb
 when living light should kiss it
old man tis unnatural
 even like the deed that's done on tuesday last
 a falcon towering in her pride of place
 was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd
ross and duncan's horsesa thing most strange and certain
 beauteous and swift the minions of their race
 turn'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
 contending gainst obedience as they would make
 war with mankind
old man tis said they eat each other
ross they did so to the amazement of mine eyes
 that look'd upon't here comes the good macduff
 enter macduff
 how goes the world sir now
macduff why see you not
ross is't known who did this more than bloody deed
macduff those that macbeth hath slain
ross alas the day
 what good could they pretend
macduff they were suborn'd
 malcolm and donalbain the king's two sons
 are stol'n away and fled which puts upon them
 suspicion of the deed
ross gainst nature still
 thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
 thine own life's means then tis most like
 the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth
macduff he is already named and gone to scone
 to be invested
ross where is duncan's body
macduff carried to colmekill
 the sacred storehouse of his predecessors
 and guardian of their bones
ross will you to scone
macduff no cousin i'll to fife
ross well i will thither
macduff well may you see things well done there adieu
 lest our old robes sit easier than our new
ross farewell father

 that would make good of bad and friends of foes

 enter banquo
banquo thou hast it now king cawdor glamis all
 as the weird women promised and i fear
 thou play'dst most foully for't yet it was said
 it should not stand in thy posterity
 but that myself should be the root and father
 of many kings if there come truth from them
 as upon thee macbeth their speeches shine
 why by the verities on thee made good
 may they not be my oracles as well
 and set me up in hope but hush no more
 sennet sounded enter macbeth as king lady
 macbeth as queen lennox ross lords ladies and
 attendants
macbeth here's our chief guest

 it had been as a gap in our great feast
 and allthing unbecoming
macbeth tonight we hold a solemn supper sir
 and i'll request your presence
banquo let your highness
 command upon me to the which my duties
 are with a most indissoluble tie
 for ever knit
macbeth ride you this afternoon
banquo ay my good lord
macbeth we should have else desired your good advice
 which still hath been both grave and prosperous
 in this day's council but we'll take tomorrow
 is't far you ride
banquo as far my lord as will fill up the time
 twixt this and supper go not my horse the better
 i must become a borrower of the night
 for a dark hour or twain
macbeth fail not our feast
banquo my lord i will not
macbeth we hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd
 in england and in ireland not confessing
 their cruel parricide filling their hearers
 with strange invention but of that tomorrow
 when therewithal we shall have cause of state

 exit attendant
 to be thus is nothing
 but to be safely thusour fears in banquo
 stick deep and in his royalty of nature
 reigns that which would be fear'd tis much he dares
 and to that dauntless temper of his mind
 he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
 to act in safety there is none but he
 whose being i do fear and under him
 my genius is rebuked as it is said
 mark antony's was by caesar he chid the sisters
 when first they put the name of king upon me
 and bade them speak to him then prophetlike
 they hail'd him father to a line of kings
 upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
 and put a barren sceptre in my gripe
 thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand
 no son of mine succeeding if t be so
 for banquo's issue have i filed my mind
 for them the gracious duncan have i murder'd
 put rancours in the vessel of my peace
 only for them and mine eternal jewel
 given to the common enemy of man
 to make them kings the seed of banquo kings
 rather than so come fate into the list
 and champion me to the utterance who's there
 reenter attendant with two murderers
 now go to the door and stay there till we call
 exit attendant
 was it not yesterday we spoke together
first murderer it was so please your highness
macbeth well then now
 have you consider'd of my speeches know
 that it was he in the times past which held you
 so under fortune which you thought had been
 our innocent self this i made good to you
 in our last conference pass'd in probation with you
 how you were borne in hand how cross'd
 the instruments
 who wrought with them and all things else that might
 to half a soul and to a notion crazed
 say thus did banquo'
first murderer you made it known to us
macbeth i did so and went further which is now
 our point of second meeting do you find
 your patience so predominant in your nature
 that you can let this go are you so gospell'd
 to pray for this good man and for his issue
 whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
 and beggar'd yours for ever
first murderer we are men my liege
macbeth ay in the catalogue ye go for men
 as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
 shoughs waterrugs and demiwolves are clept
 all by the name of dogs the valued file
 distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
 the housekeeper the hunter every one
 according to the gift which bounteous nature
 hath in him closed whereby he does receive
 particular addition from the bill
 that writes them all alike and so of men
 now if you have a station in the file
 not i the worst rank of manhood say t
 and i will put that business in your bosoms
 whose execution takes your enemy off
 grapples you to the heart and love of us
 who wear our health but sickly in his life
 which in his death were perfect
second murderer i am one my liege
 whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
 have so incensed that i am reckless what
 i do to spite the world
first murderer and i another
 so weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune
 that i would set my lie on any chance
 to mend it or be rid on't
macbeth both of you
 know banquo was your enemy
both murderers true my lord
macbeth so is he mine and in such bloody distance
 that every minute of his being thrusts
 against my near'st of life and though i could
 with barefaced power sweep him from my sight
 and bid my will avouch it yet i must not
 for certain friends that are both his and mine
 whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall
 who i myself struck down and thence it is
 that i to your assistance do make love
 masking the business from the common eye
 for sundry weighty reasons
second murderer we shall my lord
 perform what you command us
first murderer though our lives
macbeth your spirits shine through you within this hour at most
 i will advise you where to plant yourselves
 acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time
 the moment on't for't must be done tonight
 and something from the palace always thought
 that i require a clearness and with him
 to leave no rubs nor botches in the work
 fleance his son that keeps him company
 whose absence is no less material to me
 than is his father's must embrace the fate
 of that dark hour resolve yourselves apart
 i'll come to you anon
both murderers we are resolved my lord
macbeth i'll call upon you straight abide within
 exeunt murderers
 it is concluded banquo thy soul's flight
 if it find heaven must find it out tonight

 for a few words
servant madam i will
 exit
lady macbeth nought's had all's spent
 where our desire is got without content
 tis safer to be that which we destroy
 than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
 enter macbeth
 how now my lord why do you keep alone
 of sorriest fancies your companions making
 using those thoughts which should indeed have died
 with them they think on things without all remedy
 should be without regard what's done is done
macbeth we have scotch'd the snake not kill'd it
 she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
 remains in danger of her former tooth
 but let the frame of things disjoint both the
 worlds suffer
 ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
 in the affliction of these terrible dreams
 that shake us nightly better be with the dead
 whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
 than on the torture of the mind to lie
 in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave
 after life's fitful fever he sleeps well
 treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
 malice domestic foreign levy nothing
 can touch him further
lady macbeth come on
 gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks
 be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
macbeth so shall i love and so i pray be you
 let your remembrance apply to banquo
 present him eminence both with eye and tongue
 unsafe the while that we
 must lave our honours in these flattering streams
 and make our faces vizards to our hearts
 disguising what they are
lady macbeth you must leave this
macbeth o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
 thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives
lady macbeth but in them nature's copy's not eterne
macbeth there's comfort yet they are assailable
 then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown
 his cloister'd flight ere to black hecate's summons
 the shardborne beetle with his drowsy hums
 hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done
 a deed of dreadful note
lady macbeth what's to be done
macbeth be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
 till thou applaud the deed come seeling night
 scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
 and with thy bloody and invisible hand
 cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
 which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow
 makes wing to the rooky wood
 good things of day begin to droop and drowse
 while night's black agents to their preys do rouse
 thou marvell'st at my words but hold thee still
 things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
 so prithee go with me

macbeth ay and a bold one that dare look on that
 which might appal the devil
lady macbeth o proper stuff
 this is the very painting of your fear
 this is the airdrawn dagger which you said
 led you to duncan o these flaws and starts
 impostors to true fear would well become
 a woman's story at a winter's fire
 authorized by her grandam shame itself
 why do you make such faces when all's done
 you look but on a stool
macbeth prithee see there behold look lo
 how say you
 why what care i if thou canst nod speak too
 if charnelhouses and our graves must send

macbeth if i stand here i saw him
lady macbeth fie for shame
macbeth blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time
 ere human statute purged the gentle weal
 ay and since too murders have been perform'd
 too terrible for the ear the times have been
 that when the brains were out the man would die
 and there an end but now they rise again
 with twenty mortal murders on their crowns
 and push us from our stools this is more strange
 than such a murder is
lady macbeth my worthy lord
 your noble friends do lack you
macbeth i do forget
 do not muse at me my most worthy friends
 i have a strange infirmity which is nothing
 to those that know me come love and health to all

 would he were here to all and him we thirst

 thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold
 thou hast no speculation in those eyes
 which thou dost glare with
lady macbeth think of this good peers
 but as a thing of custom tis no other
 only it spoils the pleasure of the time
macbeth what man dare i dare
 approach thou like the rugged russian bear
 the arm'd rhinoceros or the hyrcan tiger
 take any shape but that and my firm nerves
 shall never tremble or be alive again
 and dare me to the desert with thy sword
 if trembling i inhabit then protest me
 the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow
 unreal mockery hence
 ghost of banquo vanishes
 why so being gone
 i am a man again pray you sit still
lady macbeth you have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting
 with most admired disorder
macbeth can such things be
 and overcome us like a summer's cloud
 without our special wonder you make me strange
 even to the disposition that i owe
 when now i think you can behold such sights
 and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
 when mine is blanched with fear
ross what sights my lord

first witch why how now hecate you look angerly
hecate have i not reason beldams as you are
 saucy and overbold how did you dare
 to trade and traffic with macbeth
 in riddles and affairs of death
 and i the mistress of your charms
 the close contriver of all harms
 was never call'd to bear my part
 or show the glory of our art
 and which is worse all you have done
 hath been but for a wayward son
 spiteful and wrathful who as others do
 loves for his own ends not for you
 but make amends now get you gone
 and at the pit of acheron
 meet me i the morning thither he
 will come to know his destiny
 your vessels and your spells provide
 your charms and every thing beside
 i am for the air this night i'll spend
 unto a dismal and a fatal end
 great business must be wrought ere noon
 upon the corner of the moon
 there hangs a vaporous drop profound
 i'll catch it ere it come to ground
 and that distill'd by magic sleights
 shall raise such artificial sprites
 as by the strength of their illusion
 shall draw him on to his confusion
 he shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
 he hopes bove wisdom grace and fear
 and you all know security
 is mortals chiefest enemy
 music and a song within come away come
 away &c
 hark i am call'd my little spirit see
 sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me

act iii
scene vi forres the palace
 enter lennox and another lord
lennox my former speeches have but hit your thoughts
 which can interpret further only i say
 things have been strangely borne the
 gracious duncan
 was pitied of macbeth marry he was dead
 and the rightvaliant banquo walk'd too late
 whom you may say if't please you fleance kill'd
 for fleance fled men must not walk too late
 who cannot want the thought how monstrous
 it was for malcolm and for donalbain
 to kill their gracious father damned fact
 how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight
 in pious rage the two delinquents tear
 that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
 was not that nobly done ay and wisely too
 for twould have anger'd any heart alive
 to hear the men deny't so that i say
 he has borne all things well and i do think
 that had he duncan's sons under his key
 as an't please heaven he shall notthey
 should find
 what twere to kill a father so should fleance
 but peace for from broad words and cause he fail'd
 his presence at the tyrant's feast i hear
 macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell
 where he bestows himself
lord the son of duncan
 from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
 lives in the english court and is received
 of the most pious edward with such grace
 that the malevolence of fortune nothing
 takes from his high respect thither macduff
 is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
 to wake northumberland and warlike siward
 that by the help of thesewith him above
 to ratify the workwe may again
 give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
 free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
 do faithful homage and receive free honours
 all which we pine for now and this report
 hath so exasperate the king that he
 prepares for some attempt of war
lennox sent he to macduff
lord he did and with an absolute sir not i'
 the cloudy messenger turns me his back
 and hums as who should say you'll rue the time
 that clogs me with this answer'
lennox and that well might
 advise him to a caution to hold what distance
 his wisdom can provide some holy angel
 fly to the court of england and unfold
 his message ere he come that a swift blessing
 may soon return to this our suffering country
 under a hand accursed
lord i'll send my prayers with him

scene ii fife macduff's castle
 enter lady macduff her son and ross
lady macduff what had he done to make him fly the land
ross you must have patience madam
lady macduff he had none
 his flight was madness when our actions do not
 our fears do make us traitors
ross you know not
 whether it was his wisdom or his fear
lady macduff wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes
 his mansion and his titles in a place
 from whence himself does fly he loves us not
 he wants the natural touch for the poor wren
 the most diminutive of birds will fight
 her young ones in her nest against the owl
 all is the fear and nothing is the love
 as little is the wisdom where the flight
 so runs against all reason
ross my dearest coz
 i pray you school yourself but for your husband
 he is noble wise judicious and best knows
 the fits o the season i dare not speak
 much further
 but cruel are the times when we are traitors
 and do not know ourselves when we hold rumour
 from what we fear yet know not what we fear
 but float upon a wild and violent sea
 each way and move i take my leave of you
 shall not be long but i'll be here again
 things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
 to what they were before my pretty cousin
 blessing upon you
lady macduff father'd he is and yet he's fatherless
ross i am so much a fool should i stay longer
 it would be my disgrace and your discomfort
 i take my leave at once
 exit
lady macduff sirrah your father's dead
 and what will you do now how will you live
son as birds do mother
lady macduff what with worms and flies
son with what i get i mean and so do they
lady macduff poor bird thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime
 the pitfall nor the gin
son why should i mother poor birds they are not set for
 my father is not dead for all your saying
lady macduff yes he is dead how wilt thou do for a father
son nay how will you do for a husband
lady macduff why i can buy me twenty at any market
son then you'll buy em to sell again
lady macduff thou speak'st with all thy wit and yet i faith
 with wit enough for thee
son was my father a traitor mother
lady macduff ay that he was
son what is a traitor
lady macduff why one that swears and lies
son and be all traitors that do so
lady macduff every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
son and must they all be hanged that swear and lie
lady macduff every one
son who must hang them
lady macduff why the honest men
son then the liars and swearers are fools
 for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
 the honest men and hang up them
lady macduff now god help thee poor monkey
 but how wilt thou do for a father
son if he were dead you'ld weep for
 him if you would not it were a good sign
 that i should quickly have a new father
lady macduff poor prattler how thou talk'st
 enter a messenger
messenger bless you fair dame i am not to you known
 though in your state of honour i am perfect
 i doubt some danger does approach you nearly
 if you will take a homely man's advice
 be not found here hence with your little ones
 to fright you thus methinks i am too savage
 to do worse to you were fell cruelty
 which is too nigh your person heaven preserve you
 i dare abide no longer
 exit
lady macduff whither should i fly
 i have done no harm but i remember now
 i am in this earthly world where to do harm
 is often laudable to do good sometime
 accounted dangerous folly why then alas
 do i put up that womanly defence
 to say i have done no harm
 enter murderers
 what are these faces
first murderer where is your husband
lady macduff i hope in no place so unsanctified

act iv
scene iii england before the king's palace
 enter malcolm and macduff
malcolm let us seek out some desolate shade and there
 weep our sad bosoms empty
macduff let us rather
 hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
 bestride our downfall'n birthdom each new morn
 new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
 strike heaven on the face that it resounds
 as if it felt with scotland and yell'd out
 like syllable of dolour
malcolm what i believe i'll wail
 what know believe and what i can redress
 as i shall find the time to friend i will
 what you have spoke it may be so perchance
 this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
 was once thought honest you have loved him well
 he hath not touch'd you yet i am young
 but something
 you may deserve of him through me and wisdom
 to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
 to appease an angry god
macduff i am not treacherous
malcolm but macbeth is
 a good and virtuous nature may recoil
 in an imperial charge but i shall crave
 your pardon
 that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
 angels are bright still though the brightest fell
 though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
 yet grace must still look so
macduff i have lost my hopes
malcolm perchance even there where i did find my doubts
 why in that rawness left you wife and child
 those precious motives those strong knots of love
 without leavetaking i pray you
 let not my jealousies be your dishonours
 but mine own safeties you may be rightly just
 whatever i shall think
macduff bleed bleed poor country
 great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
 for goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou
 thy wrongs
 the title is affeer'd fare thee well lord
 i would not be the villain that thou think'st
 for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp
 and the rich east to boot
malcolm be not offended
 i speak not as in absolute fear of you
 i think our country sinks beneath the yoke
 it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
 is added to her wounds i think withal
 there would be hands uplifted in my right
 and here from gracious england have i offer
 of goodly thousands but for all this
 when i shall tread upon the tyrant's head
 or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
 shall have more vices than it had before
 more suffer and more sundry ways than ever
 by him that shall succeed
macduff what should he be
malcolm it is myself i mean in whom i know
 all the particulars of vice so grafted
 that when they shall be open'd black macbeth
 will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
 esteem him as a lamb being compared
 with my confineless harms
macduff not in the legions
 of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
 in evils to top macbeth
malcolm i grant him bloody
 luxurious avaricious false deceitful
 sudden malicious smacking of every sin
 that has a name but there's no bottom none
 in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
 your matrons and your maids could not fill up
 the cistern of my lust and my desire
 all continent impediments would o'erbear
 that did oppose my will better macbeth
 than such an one to reign
macduff boundless intemperance
 in nature is a tyranny it hath been
 the untimely emptying of the happy throne
 and fall of many kings but fear not yet
 to take upon you what is yours you may
 convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
 and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
 we have willing dames enough there cannot be
 that vulture in you to devour so many
 as will to greatness dedicate themselves
 finding it so inclined
malcolm with this there grows
 in my most illcomposed affection such
 a stanchless avarice that were i king
 i should cut off the nobles for their lands
 desire his jewels and this other's house
 and my morehaving would be as a sauce
 to make me hunger more that i should forge
 quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
 destroying them for wealth
macduff this avarice
 sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
 than summerseeming lust and it hath been
 the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear
 scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
 of your mere own all these are portable
 with other graces weigh'd
malcolm but i have none the kingbecoming graces
 as justice verity temperance stableness
 bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
 devotion patience courage fortitude
 i have no relish of them but abound
 in the division of each several crime
 acting it many ways nay had i power i should
 pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
 uproar the universal peace confound
 all unity on earth
macduff o scotland scotland
malcolm if such a one be fit to govern speak
 i am as i have spoken
macduff fit to govern
 no not to live o nation miserable
 with an untitled tyrant bloodyscepter'd
 when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
 since that the truest issue of thy throne
 by his own interdiction stands accursed
 and does blaspheme his breed thy royal father
 was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
 oftener upon her knees than on her feet
 died every day she lived fare thee well
 these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
 have banish'd me from scotland o my breast
 thy hope ends here
malcolm macduff this noble passion
 child of integrity hath from my soul
 wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts
 to thy good truth and honour devilish macbeth
 by many of these trains hath sought to win me
 into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
 from overcredulous haste but god above
 deal between thee and me for even now
 i put myself to thy direction and
 unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
 the taints and blames i laid upon myself
 for strangers to my nature i am yet
 unknown to woman never was forsworn
 scarcely have coveted what was mine own
 at no time broke my faith would not betray
 the devil to his fellow and delight
 no less in truth than life my first false speaking
 was this upon myself what i am truly
 is thine and my poor country's to command
 whither indeed before thy hereapproach
 old siward with ten thousand warlike men
 already at a point was setting forth
 now we'll together and the chance of goodness
 be like our warranted quarrel why are you silent
macduff such welcome and unwelcome things at once
 tis hard to reconcile
 enter a doctor
malcolm well more anoncomes the king forth i pray you
doctor ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
 that stay his cure their malady convinces
 the great assay of art but at his touch
 such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
 they presently amend
malcolm i thank you doctor
 exit doctor
macduff what's the disease he means
malcolm tis call'd the evil
 a most miraculous work in this good king
 which often since my hereremain in england
 i have seen him do how he solicits heaven
 himself best knows but strangelyvisited people
 all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye
 the mere despair of surgery he cures
 hanging a golden stamp about their necks
 put on with holy prayers and tis spoken
 to the succeeding royalty he leaves
 the healing benediction with this strange virtue
 he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy
 and sundry blessings hang about his throne
 that speak him full of grace
 enter ross
macduff see who comes here
malcolm my countryman but yet i know him not
macduff my evergentle cousin welcome hither
malcolm i know him now good god betimes remove
 the means that makes us strangers
ross sir amen
macduff stands scotland where it did
ross alas poor country
 almost afraid to know itself it cannot
 be call'd our mother but our grave where nothing
 but who knows nothing is once seen to smile
 where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
 are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems
 a modern ecstasy the dead man's knell
 is there scarce ask'd for who and good men's lives
 expire before the flowers in their caps
 dying or ere they sicken
macduff o relation
 too nice and yet too true
malcolm what's the newest grief
ross that of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker
 each minute teems a new one
macduff how does my wife
ross why well
macduff and all my children
ross well too
macduff the tyrant has not batter'd at their peace
ross no they were well at peace when i did leave em
macduff but not a niggard of your speech how goes't
ross when i came hither to transport the tidings
 which i have heavily borne there ran a rumour
 of many worthy fellows that were out
 which was to my belief witness'd the rather
 for that i saw the tyrant's power afoot
 now is the time of help your eye in scotland
 would create soldiers make our women fight
 to doff their dire distresses
malcolm be't their comfort
 we are coming thither gracious england hath
 lent us good siward and ten thousand men
 an older and a better soldier none
 that christendom gives out
ross would i could answer
 this comfort with the like but i have words
 that would be howl'd out in the desert air
 where hearing should not latch them
macduff what concern they
 the general cause or is it a feegrief
 due to some single breast
ross no mind that's honest
 but in it shares some woe though the main part
 pertains to you alone
macduff if it be mine
 keep it not from me quickly let me have it
ross let not your ears despise my tongue for ever
 which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
 that ever yet they heard
macduff hum i guess at it
ross your castle is surprised your wife and babes
 savagely slaughter'd to relate the manner
 were on the quarry of these murder'd deer
 to add the death of you
malcolm merciful heaven
 what man ne'er pull your hat upon your brows
 give sorrow words the grief that does not speak
 whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break
macduff my children too
ross wife children servants all
 that could be found
macduff and i must be from thence
 my wife kill'd too
ross i have said
malcolm be comforted
 let's make us medicines of our great revenge
 to cure this deadly grief
macduff he has no children all my pretty ones
 did you say all o hellkite all
 what all my pretty chickens and their dam
 at one fell swoop
malcolm dispute it like a man
macduff i shall do so
 but i must also feel it as a man
 i cannot but remember such things were
 that were most precious to me did heaven look on
 and would not take their part sinful macduff
 they were all struck for thee naught that i am
 not for their own demerits but for mine
 fell slaughter on their souls heaven rest them now
malcolm be this the whetstone of your sword let grief
 convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
macduff o i could play the woman with mine eyes
 and braggart with my tongue but gentle heavens
 cut short all intermission front to front
 bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself
 within my sword's length set him if he scape
 heaven forgive him too
malcolm this tune goes manly
 come go we to the king our power is ready
 our lack is nothing but our leave macbeth
 is ripe for shaking and the powers above
 put on their instruments receive what cheer you may
 the night is long that never finds the day

messenger let me endure your wrath if't be not so

 i say a moving grove
macbeth if thou speak'st false
 upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
 till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
 i care not if thou dost for me as much
 i pull in resolution and begin
 to doubt the equivocation of the fiend
 that lies like truth fear not till birnam wood
 do come to dunsinane and now a wood
 comes toward dunsinane arm arm and out

roderigo tush never tell me i take it much unkindly
 that thou iago who hast had my purse
 as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
iago sblood but you will not hear me
 if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me
roderigo thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate
iago despise me if i do not three great ones of the city
 in personal suit to make me his lieutenant
 offcapp'd to him and by the faith of man
 i know my price i am worth no worse a place
 but he as loving his own pride and purposes
 evades them with a bombast circumstance
 horribly stuff'd with epithets of war
 and in conclusion
 nonsuits my mediators for certes says he
 i have already chose my officer'
 and what was he
 forsooth a great arithmetician
 one michael cassio a florentine
 a fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife
 that never set a squadron in the field
 nor the division of a battle knows
 more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
 wherein the toged consuls can propose
 as masterly as he mere prattle without practise
 is all his soldiership but he sir had the election
 and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof
 at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds
 christian and heathen must be belee'd and calm'd
 by debitor and creditor this countercaster
 he in good time must his lieutenant be
 and igod bless the markhis moorship's ancient
roderigo by heaven i rather would have been his hangman
iago why there's no remedy tis the curse of service
 preferment goes by letter and affection
 and not by old gradation where each second
 stood heir to the first now sir be judge yourself
 whether i in any just term am affined
 to love the moor
roderigo i would not follow him then
iago o sir content you
 i follow him to serve my turn upon him
 we cannot all be masters nor all masters
 cannot be truly follow'd you shall mark
 many a duteous and kneecrooking knave
 that doting on his own obsequious bondage
 wears out his time much like his master's ass
 for nought but provender and when he's old cashier'd
 whip me such honest knaves others there are
 who trimm'd in forms and visages of duty
 keep yet their hearts attending on themselves
 and throwing but shows of service on their lords
 do well thrive by them and when they have lined
 their coats
 do themselves homage these fellows have some soul
 and such a one do i profess myself for sir
 it is as sure as you are roderigo
 were i the moor i would not be iago
 in following him i follow but myself
 heaven is my judge not i for love and duty
 but seeming so for my peculiar end
 for when my outward action doth demonstrate
 the native act and figure of my heart
 in compliment extern tis not long after
 but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve
 for daws to peck at i am not what i am
roderigo what a full fortune does the thicklips owe
 if he can carry't thus
iago call up her father
 rouse him make after him poison his delight
 proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen
 and though he in a fertile climate dwell
 plague him with flies though that his joy be joy
 yet throw such changes of vexation on't
 as it may lose some colour
roderigo here is her father's house i'll call aloud
iago do with like timorous accent and dire yell
 as when by night and negligence the fire
 is spied in populous cities
roderigo what ho brabantio signior brabantio ho
iago awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves thieves
 look to your house your daughter and your bags
 thieves thieves
 brabantio appears above at a window
brabantio what is the reason of this terrible summons
 what is the matter there
roderigo signior is all your family within
iago are your doors lock'd
brabantio why wherefore ask you this
iago zounds sir you're robb'd for shame put on
 your gown
 your heart is burst you have lost half your soul
 even now now very now an old black ram
 is topping your white ewe arise arise
 awake the snorting citizens with the bell
 or else the devil will make a grandsire of you
 arise i say
brabantio what have you lost your wits
roderigo most reverend signior do you know my voice
brabantio not i what are you
roderigo my name is roderigo
brabantio the worser welcome
 i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors
 in honest plainness thou hast heard me say
 my daughter is not for thee and now in madness
 being full of supper and distempering draughts
 upon malicious bravery dost thou come
 to start my quiet
roderigo sir sir sir
brabantio but thou must needs be sure
 my spirit and my place have in them power
 to make this bitter to thee
roderigo patience good sir
brabantio what tell'st thou me of robbing this is venice
 my house is not a grange
roderigo most grave brabantio
 in simple and pure soul i come to you
iago zounds sir you are one of those that will not
 serve god if the devil bid you because we come to
 do you service and you think we are ruffians you'll
 have your daughter covered with a barbary horse
 you'll have your nephews neigh to you you'll have
 coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
brabantio what profane wretch art thou
iago i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter
 and the moor are now making the beast with two backs
brabantio thou art a villain
iago you area senator
brabantio this thou shalt answer i know thee roderigo
roderigo sir i will answer any thing but i beseech you
 if't be your pleasure and most wise consent
 as partly i find it is that your fair daughter
 at this oddeven and dull watch o the night
 transported with no worse nor better guard
 but with a knave of common hire a gondolier
 to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor
 if this be known to you and your allowance
 we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
 but if you know not this my manners tell me
 we have your wrong rebuke do not believe
 that from the sense of all civility
 i thus would play and trifle with your reverence
 your daughter if you have not given her leave
 i say again hath made a gross revolt
 tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
 in an extravagant and wheeling stranger
 of here and every where straight satisfy yourself
 if she be in her chamber or your house
 let loose on me the justice of the state
 for thus deluding you
brabantio strike on the tinder ho
 give me a taper call up all my people
 this accident is not unlike my dream
 belief of it oppresses me already
 light i say light
 exit above
iago farewell for i must leave you
 it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
 to be producedas if i stay i shall
 against the moor for i do know the state
 however this may gall him with some cheque
 cannot with safety cast him for he's embark'd
 with such loud reason to the cyprus wars
 which even now stand in act that for their souls
 another of his fathom they have none
 to lead their business in which regard
 though i do hate him as i do hellpains
 yet for necessity of present life
 i must show out a flag and sign of love
 which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him
 lead to the sagittary the raised search
 and there will i be with him so farewell
 exit
 enter below brabantio and servants with torches
brabantio it is too true an evil gone she is
 and what's to come of my despised time
 is nought but bitterness now roderigo
 where didst thou see her o unhappy girl
 with the moor say'st thou who would be a father
 how didst thou know twas she o she deceives me
 past thought what said she to you get more tapers
 raise all my kindred are they married think you
roderigo truly i think they are
brabantio o heaven how got she out o treason of the blood
 fathers from hence trust not your daughters minds
 by what you see them act is there not charms
 by which the property of youth and maidhood
 may be abused have you not read roderigo
 of some such thing
roderigo yes sir i have indeed
brabantio call up my brother o would you had had her
 some one way some another do you know
 where we may apprehend her and the moor
roderigo i think i can discover him if you please
 to get good guard and go along with me
brabantio pray you lead on at every house i'll call
 i may command at most get weapons ho
 and raise some special officers of night
 on good roderigo i'll deserve your pains

iago though in the trade of war i have slain men
 yet do i hold it very stuff o the conscience
 to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity
 sometimes to do me service nine or ten times
 i had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs
othello tis better as it is
iago nay but he prated
 and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
 against your honour
 that with the little godliness i have
 i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir
 are you fast married be assured of this
 that the magnifico is much beloved
 and hath in his effect a voice potential
 as double as the duke's he will divorce you
 or put upon you what restraint and grievance
 the law with all his might to enforce it on
 will give him cable
othello let him do his spite
 my services which i have done the signiory
 shall outtongue his complaints tis yet to know
 which when i know that boasting is an honour
 i shall promulgatei fetch my life and being
 from men of royal siege and my demerits
 may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
 as this that i have reach'd for know iago
 but that i love the gentle desdemona
 i would not my unhoused free condition
 put into circumscription and confine
 for the sea's worth but look what lights come yond

 you were best go in

 and he requires your hasteposthaste appearance
 even on the instant
othello what is the matter think you
cassio something from cyprus as i may divine
 it is a business of some heat the galleys
 have sent a dozen sequent messengers
 this very night at one another's heels
 and many of the consuls raised and met
 are at the duke's already you have been
 hotly call'd for
 when being not at your lodging to be found
 the senate hath sent about three several guests
 to search you out
othello tis well i am found by you
 i will but spend a word here in the house
 and go with you

brabantio down with him thief
 they draw on both sides
iago you roderigo come sir i am for you
othello keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
 good signior you shall more command with years
 than with your weapons
brabantio o thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter
 damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her
 for i'll refer me to all things of sense
 if she in chains of magic were not bound
 whether a maid so tender fair and happy
 so opposite to marriage that she shunned
 the wealthy curled darlings of our nation
 would ever have to incur a general mock
 run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
 of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
 judge me the world if tis not gross in sense
 that thou hast practised on her with foul charms
 abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
 that weaken motion i'll have't disputed on
 tis probable and palpable to thinking
 i therefore apprehend and do attach thee
 for an abuser of the world a practiser
 of arts inhibited and out of warrant
 lay hold upon him if he do resist
 subdue him at his peril
othello hold your hands
 both you of my inclining and the rest
 were it my cue to fight i should have known it
 without a prompter where will you that i go
 to answer this your charge
brabantio to prison till fit time
 of law and course of direct session
 call thee to answer
othello what if i do obey
 how may the duke be therewith satisfied
 whose messengers are here about my side
 upon some present business of the state
 to bring me to him
first officer tis true most worthy signior
 the duke's in council and your noble self
 i am sure is sent for
brabantio how the duke in council
 in this time of the night bring him away
 mine's not an idle cause the duke himself
 or any of my brothers of the state
 cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own

duke of venice there is no composition in these news
 that gives them credit
first senator indeed they are disproportion'd
 my letters say a hundred and seven galleys
duke of venice and mine a hundred and forty
second senator and mine two hundred
 but though they jump not on a just account
 as in these cases where the aim reports
 tis oft with differenceyet do they all confirm
 a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus
duke of venice nay it is possible enough to judgment
 i do not so secure me in the error
 but the main article i do approve
 in fearful sense
sailor within what ho what ho what ho
first officer a messenger from the galleys
 enter a sailor
duke of venice now what's the business
sailor the turkish preparation makes for rhodes
 so was i bid report here to the state
 by signior angelo
duke of venice how say you by this change
first senator this cannot be
 by no assay of reason tis a pageant
 to keep us in false gaze when we consider
 the importancy of cyprus to the turk
 and let ourselves again but understand
 that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes
 so may he with more facile question bear it
 for that it stands not in such warlike brace
 but altogether lacks the abilities
 that rhodes is dress'd in if we make thought of this
 we must not think the turk is so unskilful
 to leave that latest which concerns him first
 neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
 to wake and wage a danger profitless
duke of venice nay in all confidence he's not for rhodes
first officer here is more news
 enter a messenger
messenger the ottomites reverend and gracious
 steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes

first senator ay so i thought how many as you guess
messenger of thirty sail and now they do restem
 their backward course bearing with frank appearance
 their purposes toward cyprus signior montano
 your trusty and most valiant servitor
 with his free duty recommends you thus
 and prays you to believe him
duke of venice tis certain then for cyprus
 marcus luccicos is not he in town

duke of venice valiant othello we must straight employ you

 to brabantio
 i did not see you welcome gentle signior
 we lack'd your counsel and your help tonight
brabantio so did i yours good your grace pardon me
 neither my place nor aught i heard of business
 hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
 take hold on me for my particular grief
 is of so floodgate and o'erbearing nature
 that it engluts and swallows other sorrows
 and it is still itself
duke of venice why what's the matter
brabantio my daughter o my daughter
duke of venice dead
senator 
brabantio ay to me
 she is abused stol'n from me and corrupted
 by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
 for nature so preposterously to err
 being not deficient blind or lame of sense
 sans witchcraft could not
duke of venice whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
 hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
 and you of her the bloody book of law
 you shall yourself read in the bitter letter
 after your own sense yea though our proper son
 stood in your action
brabantio humbly i thank your grace
 here is the man this moor whom now it seems
 your special mandate for the stateaffairs
 hath hither brought
duke of venice 
 we are very sorry for't
senator 
duke of venice to othello what in your own part can you say to this
brabantio nothing but this is so
othello most potent grave and reverend signiors
 my very noble and approved good masters
 that i have ta'en away this old man's daughter
 it is most true true i have married her
 the very head and front of my offending
 hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech
 and little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace
 for since these arms of mine had seven years pith
 till now some nine moons wasted they have used
 their dearest action in the tented field
 and little of this great world can i speak
 more than pertains to feats of broil and battle
 and therefore little shall i grace my cause
 in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience
 i will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
 of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
 what conjuration and what mighty magic
 for such proceeding i am charged withal
 i won his daughter
brabantio a maiden never bold
 of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
 blush'd at herself and she in spite of nature
 of years of country credit every thing
 to fall in love with what she fear'd to look on
 it is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
 that will confess perfection so could err
 against all rules of nature and must be driven
 to find out practises of cunning hell
 why this should be i therefore vouch again
 that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood
 or with some dram conjured to this effect
 he wrought upon her
duke of venice to vouch this is no proof
 without more wider and more overt test
 than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
 of modern seeming do prefer against him
first senator but othello speak
 did you by indirect and forced courses
 subdue and poison this young maid's affections
 or came it by request and such fair question
 as soul to soul affordeth
othello i do beseech you
 send for the lady to the sagittary
 and let her speak of me before her father
 if you do find me foul in her report
 the trust the office i do hold of you
 not only take away but let your sentence
 even fall upon my life
duke of venice fetch desdemona hither
othello ancient conduct them you best know the place
 exeunt iago and attendants
 and till she come as truly as to heaven
 i do confess the vices of my blood
 so justly to your grave ears i'll present
 how i did thrive in this fair lady's love
 and she in mine
duke of venice say it othello
othello her father loved me oft invited me
 still question'd me the story of my life
 from year to year the battles sieges fortunes
 that i have passed
 i ran it through even from my boyish days
 to the very moment that he bade me tell it
 wherein i spake of most disastrous chances
 of moving accidents by flood and field
 of hairbreadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach
 of being taken by the insolent foe
 and sold to slavery of my redemption thence
 and portance in my travels history
 wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
 rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
 it was my hint to speaksuch was the process
 and of the cannibals that each other eat
 the anthropophagi and men whose heads
 do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear
 would desdemona seriously incline
 but still the houseaffairs would draw her thence
 which ever as she could with haste dispatch
 she'ld come again and with a greedy ear
 devour up my discourse which i observing
 took once a pliant hour and found good means
 to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
 that i would all my pilgrimage dilate
 whereof by parcels she had something heard
 but not intentively i did consent
 and often did beguile her of her tears
 when i did speak of some distressful stroke
 that my youth suffer'd my story being done
 she gave me for my pains a world of sighs
 she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
 twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful
 she wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd
 that heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me
 and bade me if i had a friend that loved her
 i should but teach him how to tell my story
 and that would woo her upon this hint i spake
 she loved me for the dangers i had pass'd
 and i loved her that she did pity them
 this only is the witchcraft i have used
 here comes the lady let her witness it
 enter desdemona iago and attendants
duke of venice i think this tale would win my daughter too
 good brabantio
 take up this mangled matter at the best
 men do their broken weapons rather use
 than their bare hands
brabantio i pray you hear her speak
 if she confess that she was half the wooer
 destruction on my head if my bad blame
 light on the man come hither gentle mistress
 do you perceive in all this noble company
 where most you owe obedience
desdemona my noble father
 i do perceive here a divided duty
 to you i am bound for life and education
 my life and education both do learn me
 how to respect you you are the lord of duty
 i am hitherto your daughter but here's my husband
 and so much duty as my mother show'd
 to you preferring you before her father
 so much i challenge that i may profess
 due to the moor my lord
brabantio god be wi you i have done
 please it your grace on to the stateaffairs
 i had rather to adopt a child than get it
 come hither moor
 i here do give thee that with all my heart
 which but thou hast already with all my heart
 i would keep from thee for your sake jewel
 i am glad at soul i have no other child
 for thy escape would teach me tyranny
 to hang clogs on them i have done my lord
duke of venice let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
 which as a grise or step may help these lovers
 into your favour
 when remedies are past the griefs are ended
 by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
 to mourn a mischief that is past and gone
 is the next way to draw new mischief on
 what cannot be preserved when fortune takes
 patience her injury a mockery makes
 the robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief
 he robs himself that spends a bootless grief
brabantio so let the turk of cyprus us beguile
 we lose it not so long as we can smile
 he bears the sentence well that nothing bears
 but the free comfort which from thence he hears
 but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
 that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
 these sentences to sugar or to gall
 being strong on both sides are equivocal
 but words are words i never yet did hear
 that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear
 i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
duke of venice the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
 cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best
 known to you and though we have there a substitute
 of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a
 sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer
 voice on you you must therefore be content to
 slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
 more stubborn and boisterous expedition
othello the tyrant custom most grave senators
 hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
 my thricedriven bed of down i do agnise
 a natural and prompt alacrity
 i find in hardness and do undertake
 these present wars against the ottomites
 most humbly therefore bending to your state
 i crave fit disposition for my wife
 due reference of place and exhibition
 with such accommodation and besort
 as levels with her breeding
duke of venice if you please
 be't at her father's
brabantio i'll not have it so
othello nor i
desdemona nor i i would not there reside
 to put my father in impatient thoughts
 by being in his eye most gracious duke
 to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
 and let me find a charter in your voice
 to assist my simpleness
duke of venice what would you desdemona
desdemona that i did love the moor to live with him
 my downright violence and storm of fortunes
 may trumpet to the world my heart's subdued
 even to the very quality of my lord
 i saw othello's visage in his mind
 and to his honour and his valiant parts
 did i my soul and fortunes consecrate
 so that dear lords if i be left behind
 a moth of peace and he go to the war
 the rites for which i love him are bereft me
 and i a heavy interim shall support
 by his dear absence let me go with him
othello let her have your voices
 vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not
 to please the palate of my appetite
 nor to comply with heatthe young affects
 in me defunctand proper satisfaction
 but to be free and bounteous to her mind
 and heaven defend your good souls that you think
 i will your serious and great business scant
 for she is with me no when lightwing'd toys
 of feather'd cupid seal with wanton dullness
 my speculative and officed instruments
 that my disports corrupt and taint my business
 let housewives make a skillet of my helm
 and all indign and base adversities
 make head against my estimation
duke of venice be it as you shall privately determine
 either for her stay or going the affair cries haste
 and speed must answer it
first senator you must away tonight
othello with all my heart
duke of venice at nine i the morning here we'll meet again
 othello leave some officer behind
 and he shall our commission bring to you
 with such things else of quality and respect
 as doth import you
othello so please your grace my ancient
 a man he is of honest and trust
 to his conveyance i assign my wife
 with what else needful your good grace shall think
 to be sent after me
duke of venice let it be so
 good night to every one
 to brabantio
 and noble signior
 if virtue no delighted beauty lack
 your soninlaw is far more fair than black
first senator adieu brave moor use desdemona well
brabantio look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see
 she has deceived her father and may thee
 exeunt duke of venice senators officers &c
othello my life upon her faith honest iago
 my desdemona must i leave to thee
 i prithee let thy wife attend on her
 and bring them after in the best advantage
 come desdemona i have but an hour
 of love of worldly matters and direction
 to spend with thee we must obey the time
 exeunt othello and desdemona
roderigo iago
iago what say'st thou noble heart
roderigo what will i do thinkest thou
iago why go to bed and sleep
roderigo i will incontinently drown myself
iago if thou dost i shall never love thee after why
 thou silly gentleman
roderigo it is silliness to live when to live is torment and
 then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
iago o villainous i have looked upon the world for four
 times seven years and since i could distinguish
 betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man
 that knew how to love himself ere i would say i
 would drown myself for the love of a guineahen i
 would change my humanity with a baboon
roderigo what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so
 fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it
iago virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus
 or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which
 our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant
 nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up
 thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or
 distract it with many either to have it sterile
 with idleness or manured with industry why the
 power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
 wills if the balance of our lives had not one
 scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the
 blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
 to most preposterous conclusions but we have
 reason to cool our raging motions our carnal
 stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that
 you call love to be a sect or scion
roderigo it cannot be
iago it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
 the will come be a man drown thyself drown
 cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy
 friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with
 cables of perdurable toughness i could never
 better stead thee than now put money in thy
 purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with
 an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it
 cannot be that desdemona should long continue her
 love to the moor put money in thy pursenor he
 his to her it was a violent commencement and thou
 shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but
 money in thy purse these moors are changeable in
 their wills fill thy purse with moneythe food
 that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be
 to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must
 change for youth when she is sated with his body
 she will find the error of her choice she must
 have change she must therefore put money in thy
 purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a
 more delicate way than drowning make all the money
 thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
 an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not
 too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou
 shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of
 drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek
 thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
 to be drowned and go without her
roderigo wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on
 the issue
iago thou art sure of mego make moneyi have told
 thee often and i retell thee again and again i
 hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no
 less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge
 against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost
 thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many
 events in the womb of time which will be delivered
 traverse go provide thy money we will have more
 of this tomorrow adieu
roderigo where shall we meet i the morning
iago at my lodging
roderigo i'll be with thee betimes
iago go to farewell do you hear roderigo
roderigo what say you
iago no more of drowning do you hear
roderigo i am changed i'll go sell all my land
 exit
iago thus do i ever make my fool my purse
 for i mine own gain'd knowledge should profane
 if i would time expend with such a snipe
 but for my sport and profit i hate the moor
 and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
 he has done my office i know not if't be true
 but i for mere suspicion in that kind
 will do as if for surety he holds me well
 the better shall my purpose work on him
 cassio's a proper man let me see now
 to get his place and to plume up my will
 in double knaveryhow how let's see
 after some time to abuse othello's ear
 that he is too familiar with his wife
 he hath a person and a smooth dispose
 to be suspected framed to make women false
 the moor is of a free and open nature
 that thinks men honest that but seem to be so
 and will as tenderly be led by the nose
 as asses are
 i have't it is engender'd hell and night
 must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light
 exit
 othello
act ii
scene i a seaport in cyprus an open place near the quay
 enter montano and two gentlemen
montano what from the cape can you discern at sea
first gentleman nothing at all it is a highwrought flood
 i cannot twixt the heaven and the main
 descry a sail
montano methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
 a fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements
 if it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea
 what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
 can hold the mortise what shall we hear of this
second gentleman a segregation of the turkish fleet
 for do but stand upon the foaming shore
 the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
 the windshaked surge with high and monstrous mane
 seems to cast water on the burning bear
 and quench the guards of the everfixed pole
 i never did like molestation view
 on the enchafed flood
montano if that the turkish fleet
 be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drown'd
 it is impossible they bear it out
 enter a third gentleman
third gentleman news lads our wars are done
 the desperate tempest hath so bang'd the turks
 that their designment halts a noble ship of venice
 hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
 on most part of their fleet
montano how is this true
third gentleman the ship is here put in
 a veronesa michael cassio
 lieutenant to the warlike moor othello
 is come on shore the moor himself at sea
 and is in full commission here for cyprus
montano i am glad on't tis a worthy governor
third gentleman but this same cassio though he speak of comfort
 touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly
 and prays the moor be safe for they were parted
 with foul and violent tempest
montano pray heavens he be
 for i have served him and the man commands
 like a full soldier let's to the seaside ho
 as well to see the vessel that's come in
 as to throw out our eyes for brave othello
 even till we make the main and the aerial blue
 an indistinct regard
third gentleman come let's do so
 for every minute is expectancy
 of more arrivance
 enter cassio
cassio thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle
 that so approve the moor o let the heavens
 give him defence against the elements
 for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea
montano is he well shipp'd
cassio his bark is stoutly timber'd his pilot
 of very expert and approved allowance
 therefore my hopes not surfeited to death
 stand in bold cure
 a cry within a sail a sail a sail'
 enter a fourth gentleman
cassio what noise
fourth gentleman the town is empty on the brow o the sea
 stand ranks of people and they cry a sail'
cassio my hopes do shape him for the governor
 guns heard
second gentlemen they do discharge their shot of courtesy
 our friends at least
cassio i pray you sir go forth
 and give us truth who tis that is arrived
second gentleman i shall
 exit
montano but good lieutenant is your general wived
cassio most fortunately he hath achieved a maid
 that paragons description and wild fame
 one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
 and in the essential vesture of creation
 does tire the ingener
 reenter second gentleman
 how now who has put in
second gentleman tis one iago ancient to the general
cassio has had most favourable and happy speed
 tempests themselves high seas and howling winds
 the gutter'd rocks and congregated sands
 traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel
 as having sense of beauty do omit
 their mortal natures letting go safely by
 the divine desdemona
montano what is she
cassio she that i spake of our great captain's captain
 left in the conduct of the bold iago
 whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
 a se'nnight's speed great jove othello guard
 and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath
 that he may bless this bay with his tall ship
 make love's quick pants in desdemona's arms
 give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
 and bring all cyprus comfort
 enter desdemona emilia iago roderigo and
 attendants
 o behold
 the riches of the ship is come on shore
 ye men of cyprus let her have your knees
 hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven
 before behind thee and on every hand
 enwheel thee round
desdemona i thank you valiant cassio
 what tidings can you tell me of my lord
cassio he is not yet arrived nor know i aught
 but that he's well and will be shortly here
desdemona o but i fearhow lost you company
cassio the great contention of the sea and skies
 parted our fellowshipbut hark a sail
 within a sail a sail guns heard
second gentleman they give their greeting to the citadel
 this likewise is a friend
cassio see for the news
 exit gentleman
 good ancient you are welcome
 to emilia
 welcome mistress
 let it not gall your patience good iago
 that i extend my manners tis my breeding
 that gives me this bold show of courtesy
 kissing her
iago sir would she give you so much of her lips
 as of her tongue she oft bestows on me
 you'll have enough
desdemona alas she has no speech
iago in faith too much
 i find it still when i have list to sleep
 marry before your ladyship i grant
 she puts her tongue a little in her heart
 and chides with thinking
emilia you have little cause to say so
iago come on come on you are pictures out of doors
 bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens
 saints m your injuries devils being offended
 players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
desdemona o fie upon thee slanderer
iago nay it is true or else i am a turk
 you rise to play and go to bed to work
emilia you shall not write my praise
iago no let me not
desdemona what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst
 praise me
iago o gentle lady do not put me to't
 for i am nothing if not critical
desdemona come on assay there's one gone to the harbour
iago ay madam
desdemona i am not merry but i do beguile
 the thing i am by seeming otherwise
 come how wouldst thou praise me
iago i am about it but indeed my invention
 comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize
 it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours
 and thus she is deliver'd
 if she be fair and wise fairness and wit
 the one's for use the other useth it
desdemona well praised how if she be black and witty
iago if she be black and thereto have a wit
 she'll find a white that shall her blackness fit
desdemona worse and worse
emilia how if fair and foolish
iago she never yet was foolish that was fair
 for even her folly help'd her to an heir
desdemona these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
 the alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for
 her that's foul and foolish
iago there's none so foul and foolish thereunto
 but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
desdemona o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best
 but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
 woman indeed one that in the authority of her
 merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
iago she that was ever fair and never proud
 had tongue at will and yet was never loud
 never lack'd gold and yet went never gay
 fled from her wish and yet said now i may'
 she that being anger'd her revenge being nigh
 bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly
 she that in wisdom never was so frail
 to change the cod's head for the salmon's tail
 she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind
 see suitors following and not look behind
 she was a wight if ever such wight were
desdemona to do what
iago to suckle fools and chronicle small beer
desdemona o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn
 of him emilia though he be thy husband how say
 you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal
 counsellor
cassio he speaks home madam you may relish him more in
 the soldier than in the scholar
iago aside he takes her by the palm ay well said
 whisper with as little a web as this will i
 ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon
 her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship
 you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as
 these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had
 been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
 oft which now again you are most apt to play the
 sir in very good well kissed an excellent
 courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers
 to your lips would they were clysterpipes for your sake
 trumpet within
 the moor i know his trumpet
cassio tis truly so
desdemona let's meet him and receive him
cassio lo where he comes
 enter othello and attendants
othello o my fair warrior
desdemona my dear othello
othello it gives me wonder great as my content
 to see you here before me o my soul's joy
 if after every tempest come such calms
 may the winds blow till they have waken'd death
 and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
 olympushigh and duck again as low
 as hell's from heaven if it were now to die
 twere now to be most happy for i fear
 my soul hath her content so absolute
 that not another comfort like to this
 succeeds in unknown fate
desdemona the heavens forbid
 but that our loves and comforts should increase
 even as our days do grow
othello amen to that sweet powers
 i cannot speak enough of this content
 it stops me here it is too much of joy
 and this and this the greatest discords be
 kissing her
 that e'er our hearts shall make
iago aside o you are well tuned now
 but i'll set down the pegs that make this music
 as honest as i am
othello come let us to the castle
 news friends our wars are done the turks
 are drown'd
 how does my old acquaintance of this isle
 honey you shall be well desired in cyprus
 i have found great love amongst them o my sweet
 i prattle out of fashion and i dote
 in mine own comforts i prithee good iago
 go to the bay and disembark my coffers
 bring thou the master to the citadel
 he is a good one and his worthiness
 does challenge much respect come desdemona
 once more well met at cyprus
 exeunt othello desdemona and attendants
iago do thou meet me presently at the harbour come
 hither if thou be'st valiant as they say base
 men being in love have then a nobility in their
 natures more than is native to themlist me the
 lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
 guardfirst i must tell thee thisdesdemona is
 directly in love with him
roderigo with him why tis not possible
iago lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed
 mark me with what violence she first loved the moor
 but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies
 and will she love him still for prating let not
 thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed
 and what delight shall she have to look on the
 devil when the blood is made dull with the act of
 sport there should be again to inflame it and to
 give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour
 sympathy in years manners and beauties all which
 the moor is defective in now for want of these
 required conveniences her delicate tenderness will
 find itself abused begin to heave the gorge
 disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will
 instruct her in it and compel her to some second
 choice now sir this grantedas it is a most
 pregnant and unforced positionwho stands so
 eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio
 does a knave very voluble no further
 conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
 civil and humane seeming for the better compassing
 of his salt and most hidden loose affection why
 none why none a slipper and subtle knave a
 finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and
 counterfeit advantages though true advantage never
 present itself a devilish knave besides the
 knave is handsome young and hath all those
 requisites in him that folly and green minds look
 after a pestilent complete knave and the woman
 hath found him already
roderigo i cannot believe that in her she's full of
 most blessed condition
iago blessed fig'send the wine she drinks is made of
 grapes if she had been blessed she would never
 have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou
 not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst
 not mark that
roderigo yes that i did but that was but courtesy
iago lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue
 to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met
 so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
 together villanous thoughts roderigo when these
 mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes
 the master and main exercise the incorporate
 conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i
 have brought you from venice watch you tonight
 for the command i'll lay't upon you cassio knows
 you not i'll not be far from you do you find
 some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking
 too loud or tainting his discipline or from what
 other course you please which the time shall more
 favourably minister
roderigo well
iago sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply
 may strike at you provoke him that he may for
 even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to
 mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true
 taste again but by the displanting of cassio so
 shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
 the means i shall then have to prefer them and the
 impediment most profitably removed without the
 which there were no expectation of our prosperity
roderigo i will do this if i can bring it to any
 opportunity
iago i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel
 i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell
roderigo adieu
 exit
iago that cassio loves her i do well believe it
 that she loves him tis apt and of great credit
 the moor howbeit that i endure him not
 is of a constant loving noble nature
 and i dare think he'll prove to desdemona
 a most dear husband now i do love her too
 not out of absolute lust though peradventure
 i stand accountant for as great a sin
 but partly led to diet my revenge
 for that i do suspect the lusty moor
 hath leap'd into my seat the thought whereof
 doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
 and nothing can or shall content my soul
 till i am even'd with him wife for wife
 or failing so yet that i put the moor
 at least into a jealousy so strong
 that judgment cannot cure which thing to do
 if this poor trash of venice whom i trash
 for his quick hunting stand the putting on
 i'll have our michael cassio on the hip
 abuse him to the moor in the rank garb
 for i fear cassio with my nightcap too
 make the moor thank me love me and reward me
 for making him egregiously an ass
 and practising upon his peace and quiet
 even to madness tis here but yet confused
 knavery's plain face is never seen tin used

 enter a herald with a proclamation people
 following
herald it is othello's pleasure our noble and valiant
 general that upon certain tidings now arrived
 importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet
 every man put himself into triumph some to dance
 some to make bonfires each man to what sport and
 revels his addiction leads him for besides these
 beneficial news it is the celebration of his
 nuptial so much was his pleasure should be
 proclaimed all offices are open and there is full
 liberty of feasting from this present hour of five

scene iii a hall in the castle
 enter othello desdemona cassio and attendants
othello good michael look you to the guard tonight
 let's teach ourselves that honourable stop
 not to outsport discretion
cassio iago hath direction what to do
 but notwithstanding with my personal eye
 will i look to't
othello iago is most honest
 michael good night tomorrow with your earliest
 let me have speech with you
 to desdemona
 come my dear love
 the purchase made the fruits are to ensue
 that profit's yet to come tween me and you
 good night
 exeunt othello desdemona and attendants
 enter iago
cassio welcome iago we must to the watch
iago not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the
 clock our general cast us thus early for the love
 of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame
 he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and
 she is sport for jove
cassio she's a most exquisite lady
iago and i'll warrant her fun of game
cassio indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature
iago what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of
 provocation
cassio an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
iago and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
cassio she is indeed perfection
iago well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i
 have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace
 of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
 the health of black othello
cassio not tonight good iago i have very poor and
 unhappy brains for drinking i could well wish
 courtesy would invent some other custom of
 entertainment
iago o they are our friends but one cup i'll drink for
 you
cassio i have drunk but one cup tonight and that was
 craftily qualified too and behold what innovation
 it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity
 and dare not task my weakness with any more
iago what man tis a night of revels the gallants
 desire it
cassio where are they
iago here at the door i pray you call them in
cassio i'll do't but it dislikes me
 exit
iago if i can fasten but one cup upon him
 with that which he hath drunk tonight already
 he'll be as full of quarrel and offence
 as my young mistress dog now my sick fool roderigo
 whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out
 to desdemona hath tonight caroused
 potations pottledeep and he's to watch
 three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits
 that hold their honours in a wary distance
 the very elements of this warlike isle
 have i tonight fluster'd with flowing cups
 and they watch too now mongst this flock of drunkards
 am i to put our cassio in some action
 that may offend the islebut here they come
 if consequence do but approve my dream
 my boat sails freely both with wind and stream
 reenter cassio with him montano and gentlemen
 servants following with wine
cassio fore god they have given me a rouse already
montano good faith a little one not past a pint as i am
 a soldier
iago some wine ho
 sings
 and let me the canakin clink clink
 and let me the canakin clink
 a soldier's a man
 a life's but a span
 why then let a soldier drink
 some wine boys
cassio fore god an excellent song
iago i learned it in england where indeed they are
 most potent in potting your dane your german and
 your swagbellied hollanderdrink hoare nothing
 to your english
cassio is your englishman so expert in his drinking
iago why he drinks you with facility your dane dead
 drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he
 gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle
 can be filled
cassio to the health of our general
montano i am for it lieutenant and i'll do you justice
iago o sweet england
 king stephen was a worthy peer
 his breeches cost him but a crown
 he held them sixpence all too dear
 with that he call'd the tailor lown
 he was a wight of high renown
 and thou art but of low degree
 tis pride that pulls the country down
 then take thine auld cloak about thee
 some wine ho
cassio why this is a more exquisite song than the other
iago will you hear't again
cassio no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that
 does those things well god's above all and there
 be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved
iago it's true good lieutenant
cassio for mine own partno offence to the general nor
 any man of qualityi hope to be saved
iago and so do i too lieutenant
cassio ay but by your leave not before me the
 lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient let's
 have no more of this let's to our affairsforgive
 us our sinsgentlemen let's look to our business
 do not think gentlemen i am drunk this is my
 ancient this is my right hand and this is my left
 i am not drunk now i can stand well enough and
 speak well enough
all excellent well
cassio why very well then you must not think then that i am drunk
 exit
montano to the platform masters come let's set the watch
iago you see this fellow that is gone before
 he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar
 and give direction and do but see his vice
 tis to his virtue a just equinox
 the one as long as the other tis pity of him
 i fear the trust othello puts him in
 on some odd time of his infirmity
 will shake this island
montano but is he often thus
iago tis evermore the prologue to his sleep
 he'll watch the horologe a double set
 if drink rock not his cradle
montano it were well
 the general were put in mind of it
 perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
 prizes the virtue that appears in cassio
 and looks not on his evils is not this true
 enter roderigo
iago aside to him how now roderigo

montano and tis great pity that the noble moor
 should hazard such a place as his own second

 to cure him of this evilbut hark what noise

 reenter othello and attendants
othello what is the matter here
montano zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death
 faints
othello hold for your lives
iago hold ho lieutenantsirmontanogentlemen
 have you forgot all sense of place and duty
 hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame
othello why how now ho from whence ariseth this
 are we turn'd turks and to ourselves do that
 which heaven hath forbid the ottomites
 for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
 he that stirs next to carve for his own rage
 holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
 silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle
 from her propriety what is the matter masters
 honest iago that look'st dead with grieving
 speak who began this on thy love i charge thee
iago i do not know friends all but now even now
 in quarter and in terms like bride and groom
 devesting them for bed and then but now
 as if some planet had unwitted men
 swords out and tilting one at other's breast
 in opposition bloody i cannot speak
 any beginning to this peevish odds
 and would in action glorious i had lost
 those legs that brought me to a part of it
othello how comes it michael you are thus forgot
cassio i pray you pardon me i cannot speak
othello worthy montano you were wont be civil
 the gravity and stillness of your youth
 the world hath noted and your name is great
 in mouths of wisest censure what's the matter
 that you unlace your reputation thus
 and spend your rich opinion for the name
 of a nightbrawler give me answer to it
montano worthy othello i am hurt to danger
 your officer iago can inform you
 while i spare speech which something now
 offends me
 of all that i do know nor know i aught
 by me that's said or done amiss this night
 unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice
 and to defend ourselves it be a sin
 when violence assails us
othello now by heaven
 my blood begins my safer guides to rule
 and passion having my best judgment collied
 assays to lead the way if i once stir
 or do but lift this arm the best of you
 shall sink in my rebuke give me to know
 how this foul rout began who set it on
 and he that is approved in this offence
 though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth
 shall lose me what in a town of war
 yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear
 to manage private and domestic quarrel
 in night and on the court and guard of safety
 tis monstrous iago who began't
montano if partially affined or leagued in office
 thou dost deliver more or less than truth
 thou art no soldier
iago touch me not so near
 i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
 than it should do offence to michael cassio
 yet i persuade myself to speak the truth
 shall nothing wrong him thus it is general
 montano and myself being in speech
 there comes a fellow crying out for help
 and cassio following him with determined sword
 to execute upon him sir this gentleman
 steps in to cassio and entreats his pause
 myself the crying fellow did pursue
 lest by his clamouras it so fell out
 the town might fall in fright he swift of foot
 outran my purpose and i return'd the rather
 for that i heard the clink and fall of swords
 and cassio high in oath which till tonight
 i ne'er might say before when i came back
 for this was briefi found them close together
 at blow and thrust even as again they were
 when you yourself did part them
 more of this matter cannot i report
 but men are men the best sometimes forget
 though cassio did some little wrong to him
 as men in rage strike those that wish them best
 yet surely cassio i believe received
 from him that fled some strange indignity
 which patience could not pass
othello i know iago
 thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
 making it light to cassio cassio i love thee
 but never more be officer of mine
 reenter desdemona attended
 look if my gentle love be not raised up
 i'll make thee an example
desdemona what's the matter
othello all's well now sweeting come away to bed
 sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
 lead him off
 to montano who is led off
 iago look with care about the town
 and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
 come desdemona tis the soldiers life
 to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife
 exeunt all but iago and cassio
iago what are you hurt lieutenant
cassio ay past all surgery
iago marry heaven forbid
cassio reputation reputation reputation o i have lost
 my reputation i have lost the immortal part of
 myself and what remains is bestial my reputation
 iago my reputation
iago as i am an honest man i thought you had received
 some bodily wound there is more sense in that than
 in reputation reputation is an idle and most false
 imposition oft got without merit and lost without
 deserving you have lost no reputation at all
 unless you repute yourself such a loser what man
 there are ways to recover the general again you
 are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in
 policy than in malice even so as one would beat his
 offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue
 to him again and he's yours
cassio i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
 good a commander with so slight so drunken and so
 indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot
 and squabble swagger swear and discourse
 fustian with one's own shadow o thou invisible
 spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by
 let us call thee devil
iago what was he that you followed with your sword what
 had he done to you
cassio i know not
iago is't possible
cassio i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly
 a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men
 should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
 their brains that we should with joy pleasance
 revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
iago why but you are now well enough how came you thus
 recovered
cassio it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
 to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me
 another to make me frankly despise myself
iago come you are too severe a moraler as the time
 the place and the condition of this country
 stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen
 but since it is as it is mend it for your own good
cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me
 i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra
 such an answer would stop them all to be now a
 sensible man by and by a fool and presently a
 beast o strange every inordinate cup is
 unblessed and the ingredient is a devil
iago come come good wine is a good familiar creature
 if it be well used exclaim no more against it
 and good lieutenant i think you think i love you
cassio i have well approved it sir i drunk
iago you or any man living may be drunk at a time man
 i'll tell you what you shall do our general's wife
 is now the general may say so in this respect for
 that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
 contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and
 graces confess yourself freely to her importune
 her help to put you in your place again she is of
 so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition
 she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
 than she is requested this broken joint between
 you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my
 fortunes against any lay worth naming this
 crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
cassio you advise me well
iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will
 beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me
 i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here
iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i
 must to the watch
cassio good night honest iago
 exit
iago and what's he then that says i play the villain
 when this advice is free i give and honest
 probal to thinking and indeed the course
 to win the moor again for tis most easy
 the inclining desdemona to subdue
 in any honest suit she's framed as fruitful
 as the free elements and then for her
 to win the moorwere't to renounce his baptism
 all seals and symbols of redeemed sin
 his soul is so enfetter'd to her love
 that she may make unmake do what she list
 even as her appetite shall play the god
 with his weak function how am i then a villain
 to counsel cassio to this parallel course
 directly to his good divinity of hell
 when devils will the blackest sins put on
 they do suggest at first with heavenly shows
 as i do now for whiles this honest fool
 plies desdemona to repair his fortunes
 and she for him pleads strongly to the moor
 i'll pour this pestilence into his ear
 that she repeals him for her body's lust
 and by how much she strives to do him good
 she shall undo her credit with the moor
 so will i turn her virtue into pitch
 and out of her own goodness make the net
 that shall enmesh them all
 reenter roderigo
 how now roderigo
roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that
 hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is
 almost spent i have been tonight exceedingly well
 cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall
 have so much experience for my pains and so with
 no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice
iago how poor are they that have not patience
 what wound did ever heal but by degrees
 thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft
 and wit depends on dilatory time
 does't not go well cassio hath beaten thee
 and thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd cassio
 though other things grow fair against the sun
 yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
 content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning
 pleasure and action make the hours seem short
 retire thee go where thou art billeted
 away i say thou shalt know more hereafter
 nay get thee gone
 exit roderigo
 two things are to be done
 my wife must move for cassio to her mistress
 i'll set her on
 myself the while to draw the moor apart
 and bring him jump when he may cassio find
 soliciting his wife ay that's the way
 dull not device by coldness and delay
 exit

 the general's wife be stirring tell her there's
 one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech

clown she is stirring sir if she will stir hither i
 shall seem to notify unto her
cassio do good my friend
 exit clown
 enter iago
 in happy time iago
iago you have not been abed then
cassio why no the day had broke
 before we parted i have made bold iago
 to send in to your wife my suit to her
 is that she will to virtuous desdemona
 procure me some access
iago i'll send her to you presently
 and i'll devise a mean to draw the moor
 out of the way that your converse and business
 may be more free
cassio i humbly thank you for't
 exit iago
 i never knew
 a florentine more kind and honest
 enter emilia
emilia good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry
 for your displeasure but all will sure be well
 the general and his wife are talking of it
 and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies
 that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus
 and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
 he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you
 and needs no other suitor but his likings
 to take the safest occasion by the front
 to bring you in again
cassio yet i beseech you
 if you think fit or that it may be done
 give me advantage of some brief discourse
 with desdemona alone
emilia pray you come in
 i will bestow you where you shall have time
 to speak your bosom freely
cassio i am much bound to you
 exeunt

act iii
scene iii the garden of the castle
 enter desdemona cassio and emilia
desdemona be thou assured good cassio i will do
 all my abilities in thy behalf
emilia good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband
 as if the case were his
desdemona o that's an honest fellow do not doubt cassio
 but i will have my lord and you again
 as friendly as you were
cassio bounteous madam
 whatever shall become of michael cassio
 he's never any thing but your true servant
desdemona i know't i thank you you do love my lord
 you have known him long and be you well assured
 he shall in strangeness stand no further off
 than in a polite distance
cassio ay but lady
 that policy may either last so long
 or feed upon such nice and waterish diet
 or breed itself so out of circumstance
 that i being absent and my place supplied
 my general will forget my love and service
desdemona do not doubt that before emilia here
 i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee
 if i do vow a friendship i'll perform it
 to the last article my lord shall never rest
 i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience
 his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
 i'll intermingle every thing he does
 with cassio's suit therefore be merry cassio
 for thy solicitor shall rather die
 than give thy cause away
emilia madam here comes my lord
cassio madam i'll take my leave
desdemona why stay and hear me speak
cassio madam not now i am very ill at ease
 unfit for mine own purposes
desdemona well do your discretion
 exit cassio
 enter othello and iago
iago ha i like not that
othello what dost thou say
iago nothing my lord or ifi know not what
othello was not that cassio parted from my wife
iago cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it
 that he would steal away so guiltylike
 seeing you coming
othello i do believe twas he
desdemona how now my lord
 i have been talking with a suitor here
 a man that languishes in your displeasure
othello who is't you mean
desdemona why your lieutenant cassio good my lord
 if i have any grace or power to move you
 his present reconciliation take
 for if he be not one that truly loves you
 that errs in ignorance and not in cunning
 i have no judgment in an honest face
 i prithee call him back
othello went he hence now
desdemona ay sooth so humbled
 that he hath left part of his grief with me
 to suffer with him good love call him back
othello not now sweet desdemona some other time
desdemona but shall't be shortly
othello the sooner sweet for you
desdemona shall't be tonight at supper
othello no not tonight
desdemona tomorrow dinner then
othello i shall not dine at home
 i meet the captains at the citadel
desdemona why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn
 on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn
 i prithee name the time but let it not
 exceed three days in faith he's penitent
 and yet his trespass in our common reason
 save that they say the wars must make examples
 out of their bestis not almost a fault
 to incur a private cheque when shall he come
 tell me othello i wonder in my soul
 what you would ask me that i should deny
 or stand so mammering on what michael cassio
 that came awooing with you and so many a time
 when i have spoke of you dispraisingly
 hath ta'en your part to have so much to do
 to bring him in trust me i could do much
othello prithee no more let him come when he will
 i will deny thee nothing
desdemona why this is not a boon
 tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves
 or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
 or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
 to your own person nay when i have a suit
 wherein i mean to touch your love indeed
 it shall be full of poise and difficult weight
 and fearful to be granted
othello i will deny thee nothing
 whereon i do beseech thee grant me this
 to leave me but a little to myself
desdemona shall i deny you no farewell my lord
othello farewell my desdemona i'll come to thee straight
desdemona emilia come be as your fancies teach you
 whate'er you be i am obedient
 exeunt desdemona and emilia
othello excellent wretch perdition catch my soul
 but i do love thee and when i love thee not
 chaos is come again
iago my noble lord
othello what dost thou say iago
iago did michael cassio when you woo'd my lady
 know of your love
othello he did from first to last why dost thou ask
iago but for a satisfaction of my thought
 no further harm
othello why of thy thought iago
iago i did not think he had been acquainted with her
othello o yes and went between us very oft
iago indeed
othello indeed ay indeed discern'st thou aught in that
 is he not honest
iago honest my lord
othello honest ay honest
iago my lord for aught i know
othello what dost thou think
iago think my lord
othello think my lord
 by heaven he echoes me
 as if there were some monster in his thought
 too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something
 i heard thee say even now thou likedst not that
 when cassio left my wife what didst not like
 and when i told thee he was of my counsel
 in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed'
 and didst contract and purse thy brow together
 as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
 some horrible conceit if thou dost love me
 show me thy thought
iago my lord you know i love you
othello i think thou dost
 and for i know thou'rt full of love and honesty
 and weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath
 therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
 for such things in a false disloyal knave
 are tricks of custom but in a man that's just
 they are close delations working from the heart
 that passion cannot rule
iago for michael cassio
 i dare be sworn i think that he is honest
othello i think so too
iago men should be what they seem
 or those that be not would they might seem none
othello certain men should be what they seem
iago why then i think cassio's an honest man
othello nay yet there's more in this
 i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
 as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
 the worst of words
iago good my lord pardon me
 though i am bound to every act of duty
 i am not bound to that all slaves are free to
 utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false
 as where's that palace whereinto foul things
 sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure
 but some uncleanly apprehensions
 keep leets and lawdays and in session sit
 with meditations lawful
othello thou dost conspire against thy friend iago
 if thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
 a stranger to thy thoughts
iago i do beseech you
 though i perchance am vicious in my guess
 as i confess it is my nature's plague
 to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
 shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom yet
 from one that so imperfectly conceits
 would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
 out of his scattering and unsure observance
 it were not for your quiet nor your good
 nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom
 to let you know my thoughts
othello what dost thou mean
iago good name in man and woman dear my lord
 is the immediate jewel of their souls
 who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing
 twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands
 but he that filches from me my good name
 robs me of that which not enriches him
 and makes me poor indeed
othello by heaven i'll know thy thoughts
iago you cannot if my heart were in your hand
 nor shall not whilst tis in my custody
othello ha
iago o beware my lord of jealousy
 it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock
 the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss
 who certain of his fate loves not his wronger
 but o what damned minutes tells he o'er
 who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
othello o misery
iago poor and content is rich and rich enough
 but riches fineless is as poor as winter
 to him that ever fears he shall be poor
 good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
 from jealousy
othello why why is this
 think'st thou i'ld make a lie of jealousy
 to follow still the changes of the moon
 with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt
 is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat
 when i shall turn the business of my soul
 to such exsufflicate and blown surmises
 matching thy inference tis not to make me jealous
 to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
 is free of speech sings plays and dances well
 where virtue is these are more virtuous
 nor from mine own weak merits will i draw
 the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
 for she had eyes and chose me no iago
 i'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove
 and on the proof there is no more but this
 away at once with love or jealousy
iago i am glad of it for now i shall have reason
 to show the love and duty that i bear you
 with franker spirit therefore as i am bound
 receive it from me i speak not yet of proof
 look to your wife observe her well with cassio
 wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
 i would not have your free and noble nature
 out of selfbounty be abused look to't
 i know our country disposition well
 in venice they do let heaven see the pranks
 they dare not show their husbands their best conscience
 is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown
othello dost thou say so
iago she did deceive her father marrying you
 and when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks
 she loved them most
othello and so she did
iago why go to then
 she that so young could give out such a seeming
 to seal her father's eyes up close as oak
 he thought twas witchcraftbut i am much to blame
 i humbly do beseech you of your pardon
 for too much loving you
othello i am bound to thee for ever
iago i see this hath a little dash'd your spirits
othello not a jot not a jot
iago i faith i fear it has
 i hope you will consider what is spoke
 comes from my love but i do see you're moved
 i am to pray you not to strain my speech
 to grosser issues nor to larger reach
 than to suspicion
othello i will not
iago should you do so my lord
 my speech should fall into such vile success
 as my thoughts aim not at cassio's my worthy friend
 my lord i see you're moved
othello no not much moved
 i do not think but desdemona's honest
iago long live she so and long live you to think so
othello and yet how nature erring from itself
iago ay there's the point asto be bold with you
 not to affect many proposed matches
 of her own clime complexion and degree
 whereto we see in all things nature tends
 foh one may smell in such a will most rank
 foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
 but pardon me i do not in position
 distinctly speak of her though i may fear
 her will recoiling to her better judgment
 may fall to match you with her country forms
 and happily repent
othello farewell farewell
 if more thou dost perceive let me know more
 set on thy wife to observe leave me iago
iago going my lord i take my leave
othello why did i marry this honest creature doubtless
 sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
iago returning my lord i would i might entreat
 your honour
 to scan this thing no further leave it to time
 though it be fit that cassio have his place
 for sure he fills it up with great ability
 yet if you please to hold him off awhile
 you shall by that perceive him and his means
 note if your lady strain his entertainment
 with any strong or vehement importunity
 much will be seen in that in the mean time
 let me be thought too busy in my fears
 as worthy cause i have to fear i am
 and hold her free i do beseech your honour
othello fear not my government
iago i once more take my leave
 exit
othello this fellow's of exceeding honesty
 and knows all qualities with a learned spirit
 of human dealings if i do prove her haggard
 though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
 i'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
 to pray at fortune haply for i am black
 and have not those soft parts of conversation
 that chamberers have or for i am declined
 into the vale of yearsyet that's not much
 she's gone i am abused and my relief
 must be to loathe her o curse of marriage
 that we can call these delicate creatures ours
 and not their appetites i had rather be a toad
 and live upon the vapour of a dungeon
 than keep a corner in the thing i love
 for others uses yet tis the plague of great ones
 prerogatived are they less than the base
 tis destiny unshunnable like death
 even then this forked plague is fated to us
 when we do quicken desdemona comes
 reenter desdemona and emilia
 if she be false o then heaven mocks itself
 i'll not believe't
desdemona how now my dear othello
 your dinner and the generous islanders
 by you invited do attend your presence
othello i am to blame
desdemona why do you speak so faintly
 are you not well
othello i have a pain upon my forehead here
desdemona faith that's with watching twill away again
 let me but bind it hard within this hour
 it will be well
othello your napkin is too little
 he puts the handkerchief from him and it drops
 let it alone come i'll go in with you
desdemona i am very sorry that you are not well
 exeunt othello and desdemona
emilia i am glad i have found this napkin
 this was her first remembrance from the moor
 my wayward husband hath a hundred times
 woo'd me to steal it but she so loves the token
 for he conjured her she should ever keep it
 that she reserves it evermore about her
 to kiss and talk to i'll have the work ta'en out
 and give't iago what he will do with it
 heaven knows not i
 i nothing but to please his fantasy
 reenter iago
iago how now what do you here alone
emilia do not you chide i have a thing for you
iago a thing for me it is a common thing
emilia ha
iago to have a foolish wife
emilia o is that all what will you give me now
 for the same handkerchief
iago what handkerchief
emilia what handkerchief
 why that the moor first gave to desdemona
 that which so often you did bid me steal
iago hast stol'n it from her
emilia no faith she let it drop by negligence
 and to the advantage i being here took't up
 look here it is
iago a good wench give it me
emilia what will you do with t that you have been
 so earnest
 to have me filch it
iago snatching it why what's that to you
emilia if it be not for some purpose of import
 give't me again poor lady she'll run mad
 when she shall lack it
iago be not acknown on t i have use for it
 go leave me
 exit emilia
 i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin
 and let him find it trifles light as air
 are to the jealous confirmations strong
 as proofs of holy writ this may do something
 the moor already changes with my poison
 dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
 which at the first are scarce found to distaste
 but with a little act upon the blood
 burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so
 look where he comes
 reenter othello
 not poppy nor mandragora
 nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
 shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
 which thou owedst yesterday
othello ha ha false to me
iago why how now general no more of that
othello avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack
 i swear tis better to be much abused
 than but to know't a little
iago how now my lord
othello what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust
 i saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me
 i slept the next night well was free and merry
 i found not cassio's kisses on her lips
 he that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'n
 let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all
iago i am sorry to hear this
othello i had been happy if the general camp
 pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
 so i had nothing known o now for ever
 farewell the tranquil mind farewell content
 farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
 that make ambition virtue o farewell
 farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
 the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife
 the royal banner and all quality
 pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
 and o you mortal engines whose rude throats
 the immortal jove's dead clamours counterfeit
 farewell othello's occupation's gone
iago is't possible my lord
othello villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
 be sure of it give me the ocular proof
 or by the worth of man's eternal soul
 thou hadst been better have been born a dog
 than answer my waked wrath
iago is't come to this
othello make me to see't or at the least so prove it
 that the probation bear no hinge nor loop
 to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
iago my noble lord
othello if thou dost slander her and torture me
 never pray more abandon all remorse
 on horror's head horrors accumulate
 do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed
 for nothing canst thou to damnation add
 greater than that
iago o grace o heaven forgive me
 are you a man have you a soul or sense
 god be wi you take mine office o wretched fool
 that livest to make thine honesty a vice
 o monstrous world take note take note o world
 to be direct and honest is not safe
 i thank you for this profit and from hence
 i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence
othello nay stay thou shouldst be honest
iago i should be wise for honesty's a fool
 and loses that it works for
othello by the world
 i think my wife be honest and think she is not
 i think that thou art just and think thou art not
 i'll have some proof her name that was as fresh
 as dian's visage is now begrimed and black
 as mine own face if there be cords or knives
 poison or fire or suffocating streams
 i'll not endure it would i were satisfied
iago i see sir you are eaten up with passion
 i do repent me that i put it to you
 you would be satisfied
othello would nay i will
iago and may but how how satisfied my lord
 would you the supervisor grossly gape on
 behold her topp'd
othello death and damnation o
iago it were a tedious difficulty i think
 to bring them to that prospect damn them then
 if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
 more than their own what then how then
 what shall i say where's satisfaction
 it is impossible you should see this
 were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
 as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
 as ignorance made drunk but yet i say
 if imputation and strong circumstances
 which lead directly to the door of truth
 will give you satisfaction you may have't
othello give me a living reason she's disloyal
iago i do not like the office
 but sith i am enter'd in this cause so far
 prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love
 i will go on i lay with cassio lately
 and being troubled with a raging tooth
 i could not sleep
 there are a kind of men so loose of soul
 that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
 one of this kind is cassio
 in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona
 let us be wary let us hide our loves'
 and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
 cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard
 as if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
 that grew upon my lips then laid his leg
 over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd and then
 cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor'
othello o monstrous monstrous
iago nay this was but his dream
othello but this denoted a foregone conclusion
 tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
iago and this may help to thicken other proofs
 that do demonstrate thinly
othello i'll tear her all to pieces
iago nay but be wise yet we see nothing done
 she may be honest yet tell me but this
 have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
 spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand
othello i gave her such a one twas my first gift
iago i know not that but such a handkerchief
 i am sure it was your wife'sdid i today
 see cassio wipe his beard with
othello if it be that
iago if it be that or any that was hers
 it speaks against her with the other proofs
othello o that the slave had forty thousand lives
 one is too poor too weak for my revenge
 now do i see tis true look here iago
 all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven
 tis gone
 arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell
 yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne
 to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught
 for tis of aspics tongues
iago yet be content
othello o blood blood blood
iago patience i say your mind perhaps may change
othello never iago like to the pontic sea
 whose icy current and compulsive course
 ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
 to the propontic and the hellespont
 even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
 shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love
 till that a capable and wide revenge
 swallow them up now by yond marble heaven
 kneels
 in the due reverence of a sacred vow
 i here engage my words
iago do not rise yet
 kneels
 witness you everburning lights above
 you elements that clip us round about
 witness that here iago doth give up
 the execution of his wit hands heart
 to wrong'd othello's service let him command
 and to obey shall be in me remorse
 what bloody business ever
 they rise
othello i greet thy love
 not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
 and will upon the instant put thee to't
 within these three days let me hear thee say
 that cassio's not alive
iago my friend is dead tis done at your request
 but let her live
othello damn her lewd minx o damn her
 come go with me apart i will withdraw
 to furnish me with some swift means of death
 for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant
iago i am your own for ever
 exeunt
 othello
act iii
scene iv before the castle
 enter desdemona emilia and clown
desdemona do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies
clown i dare not say he lies any where
desdemona why man
clown he's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies
 is stabbing
desdemona go to where lodges he
clown to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie
desdemona can any thing be made of this
clown i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a
 lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were
 to lie in mine own throat
desdemona can you inquire him out and be edified by report
clown i will catechise the world for him that is make
 questions and by them answer
desdemona seek him bid him come hither tell him i have
 moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
clown to do this is within the compass of man's wit and
 therefore i will attempt the doing it
 exit
desdemona where should i lose that handkerchief emilia
emilia i know not madam
desdemona believe me i had rather have lost my purse
 full of crusadoes and but my noble moor
 is true of mind and made of no such baseness
 as jealous creatures are it were enough
 to put him to ill thinking
emilia is he not jealous
desdemona who he i think the sun where he was born
 drew all such humours from him
emilia look where he comes
desdemona i will not leave him now till cassio
 be call'd to him
 enter othello
 how is't with you my lord
othello well my good lady
 aside
 o hardness to dissemble
 how do you desdemona
desdemona well my good lord
othello give me your hand this hand is moist my lady
desdemona it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow
othello this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
 hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires
 a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
 much castigation exercise devout
 for here's a young and sweating devil here
 that commonly rebels tis a good hand
 a frank one
desdemona you may indeed say so
 for twas that hand that gave away my heart
othello a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands
 but our new heraldry is hands not hearts
desdemona i cannot speak of this come now your promise
othello what promise chuck
desdemona i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you
othello i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
 lend me thy handkerchief
desdemona here my lord
othello that which i gave you
desdemona i have it not about me
othello not
desdemona no indeed my lord
othello that is a fault
 that handkerchief
 did an egyptian to my mother give
 she was a charmer and could almost read
 the thoughts of people she told her while
 she kept it
 twould make her amiable and subdue my father
 entirely to her love but if she lost it
 or made gift of it my father's eye
 should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
 after new fancies she dying gave it me
 and bid me when my fate would have me wive
 to give it her i did so and take heed on't
 make it a darling like your precious eye
 to lose't or give't away were such perdition
 as nothing else could match
desdemona is't possible
othello tis true there's magic in the web of it
 a sibyl that had number'd in the world
 the sun to course two hundred compasses
 in her prophetic fury sew'd the work
 the worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk
 and it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
 conserved of maidens hearts
desdemona indeed is't true
othello most veritable therefore look to't well
desdemona then would to god that i had never seen't
othello ha wherefore
desdemona why do you speak so startingly and rash
othello is't lost is't gone speak is it out
 o the way
desdemona heaven bless us
othello say you
desdemona it is not lost but what an if it were
othello how
desdemona i say it is not lost
othello fetch't let me see't
desdemona why so i can sir but i will not now
 this is a trick to put me from my suit
 pray you let cassio be received again
othello fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
desdemona come come
 you'll never meet a more sufficient man
othello the handkerchief
desdemona i pray talk me of cassio
othello the handkerchief
desdemona a man that all his time
 hath founded his good fortunes on your love
 shared dangers with you
othello the handkerchief
desdemona in sooth you are to blame
othello away
 exit
emilia is not this man jealous
desdemona i ne'er saw this before
 sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief
 i am most unhappy in the loss of it
emilia tis not a year or two shows us a man
 they are all but stomachs and we all but food
 to eat us hungerly and when they are full
 they belch us look you cassio and my husband
 enter cassio and iago
iago there is no other way tis she must do't
 and lo the happiness go and importune her
desdemona how now good cassio what's the news with you
cassio madam my former suit i do beseech you
 that by your virtuous means i may again
 exist and be a member of his love
 whom i with all the office of my heart
 entirely honour i would not be delay'd
 if my offence be of such mortal kind
 that nor my service past nor present sorrows
 nor purposed merit in futurity
 can ransom me into his love again
 but to know so must be my benefit
 so shall i clothe me in a forced content
 and shut myself up in some other course
 to fortune's alms
desdemona alas thricegentle cassio
 my advocation is not now in tune
 my lord is not my lord nor should i know him
 were he in favour as in humour alter'd
 so help me every spirit sanctified
 as i have spoken for you all my best
 and stood within the blank of his displeasure
 for my free speech you must awhile be patient
 what i can do i will and more i will
 than for myself i dare let that suffice you
iago is my lord angry
emilia he went hence but now
 and certainly in strange unquietness
iago can he be angry i have seen the cannon
 when it hath blown his ranks into the air
 and like the devil from his very arm
 puff'd his own brotherand can he be angry
 something of moment then i will go meet him
 there's matter in't indeed if he be angry
desdemona i prithee do so
 exit iago
 something sure of state
 either from venice or some unhatch'd practise
 made demonstrable here in cyprus to him
 hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
 men's natures wrangle with inferior things
 though great ones are their object tis even so
 for let our finger ache and it indues
 our other healthful members even to that sense
 of pain nay we must think men are not gods
 nor of them look for such observances
 as fit the bridal beshrew me much emilia
 i was unhandsome warrior as i am
 arraigning his unkindness with my soul
 but now i find i had suborn'd the witness
 and he's indicted falsely
emilia pray heaven it be statematters as you think
 and no conception nor no jealous toy
 concerning you
desdemona alas the day i never gave him cause
emilia but jealous souls will not be answer'd so
 they are not ever jealous for the cause
 but jealous for they are jealous tis a monster
 begot upon itself born on itself
desdemona heaven keep that monster from othello's mind
emilia lady amen
desdemona i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout
 if i do find him fit i'll move your suit
 and seek to effect it to my uttermost
cassio i humbly thank your ladyship
 exeunt desdemona and emilia
 enter bianca
bianca save you friend cassio
cassio what make you from home
 how is it with you my most fair bianca
 i faith sweet love i was coming to your house
bianca and i was going to your lodging cassio
 what keep a week away seven days and nights
 eight score eight hours and lovers absent hours
 more tedious than the dial eight score times
 o weary reckoning
cassio pardon me bianca
 i have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd
 but i shall in a more continuate time
 strike off this score of absence sweet bianca
 giving her desdemona's handkerchief
 take me this work out
bianca o cassio whence came this
 this is some token from a newer friend
 to the felt absence now i feel a cause
 is't come to this well well
cassio go to woman

 from whence you have them you are jealous now
 that this is from some mistress some remembrance
 no in good troth bianca
bianca why whose is it
cassio i know not sweet i found it in my chamber
 i like the work well ere it be demanded
 as like enough it willi'ld have it copied
 take it and do't and leave me for this time
bianca leave you wherefore
cassio i do attend here on the general
 and think it no addition nor my wish
 to have him see me woman'd
bianca why i pray you
cassio not that i love you not
bianca but that you do not love me
 i pray you bring me on the way a little
 and say if i shall see you soon at night
cassio tis but a little way that i can bring you
 for i attend here but i'll see you soon
bianca tis very good i must be circumstanced

 othello
act iv
scene i cyprus before the castle
 enter othello and iago
iago will you think so
othello think so iago
iago what
 to kiss in private
othello an unauthorized kiss
iago or to be naked with her friend in bed
 an hour or more not meaning any harm
othello naked in bed iago and not mean harm
 it is hypocrisy against the devil
 they that mean virtuously and yet do so
 the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
iago so they do nothing tis a venial slip
 but if i give my wife a handkerchief
othello what then
iago why then tis hers my lord and being hers
 she may i think bestow't on any man
othello she is protectress of her honour too
 may she give that
iago her honour is an essence that's not seen
 they have it very oft that have it not
 but for the handkerchief
othello by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it
 thou said'st it comes o'er my memory
 as doth the raven o'er the infected house
 boding to allhe had my handkerchief
iago ay what of that
othello that's not so good now
iago what
 if i had said i had seen him do you wrong
 or heard him sayas knaves be such abroad
 who having by their own importunate suit
 or voluntary dotage of some mistress
 convinced or supplied them cannot choose
 but they must blab
othello hath he said any thing
iago he hath my lord but be you well assured
 no more than he'll unswear
othello what hath he said
iago faith that he didi know not what he did
othello what what
iago lie
othello with her
iago with her on her what you will
othello lie with her lie on her we say lie on her when
 they belie her lie with her that's fulsome
 handkerchiefconfessionshandkerchiefto
 confess and be hanged for his labourfirst to be
 hanged and then to confessi tremble at it
 nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
 passion without some instruction it is not words
 that shake me thus pish noses ears and lips
 is't possibleconfesshandkerchiefo devil
 falls in a trance
iago work on
 my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught
 and many worthy and chaste dames even thus
 all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord
 my lord i say othello
 enter cassio
 how now cassio
cassio what's the matter
iago my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy
 this is his second fit he had one yesterday
cassio rub him about the temples
iago no forbear
 the lethargy must have his quiet course
 if not he foams at mouth and by and by
 breaks out to savage madness look he stirs
 do you withdraw yourself a little while
 he will recover straight when he is gone
 i would on great occasion speak with you
 exit cassio
 how is it general have you not hurt your head
othello dost thou mock me
iago i mock you no by heaven
 would you would bear your fortune like a man
othello a horned man's a monster and a beast
iago there's many a beast then in a populous city
 and many a civil monster
othello did he confess it
iago good sir be a man
 think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
 may draw with you there's millions now alive
 that nightly lie in those unproper beds
 which they dare swear peculiar your case is better
 o tis the spite of hell the fiend's archmock
 to lip a wanton in a secure couch
 and to suppose her chaste no let me know
 and knowing what i am i know what she shall be
othello o thou art wise tis certain
iago stand you awhile apart
 confine yourself but in a patient list
 whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief
 a passion most unsuiting such a man
 cassio came hither i shifted him away
 and laid good scuse upon your ecstasy
 bade him anon return and here speak with me
 the which he promised do but encave yourself
 and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
 that dwell in every region of his face
 for i will make him tell the tale anew
 where how how oft how long ago and when
 he hath and is again to cope your wife
 i say but mark his gesture marry patience
 or i shall say you are all in all in spleen
 and nothing of a man
othello dost thou hear iago
 i will be found most cunning in my patience
 butdost thou hearmost bloody
iago that's not amiss
 but yet keep time in all will you withdraw
 othello retires
 now will i question cassio of bianca
 a housewife that by selling her desires
 buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature
 that dotes on cassio as tis the strumpet's plague
 to beguile many and be beguiled by one
 he when he hears of her cannot refrain
 from the excess of laughter here he comes
 reenter cassio
 as he shall smile othello shall go mad
 and his unbookish jealousy must construe
 poor cassio's smiles gestures and light behavior
 quite in the wrong how do you now lieutenant
cassio the worser that you give me the addition
 whose want even kills me
iago ply desdemona well and you are sure on't
 speaking lower
 now if this suit lay in bianco's power
 how quickly should you speed
cassio alas poor caitiff
othello look how he laughs already
iago i never knew woman love man so
cassio alas poor rogue i think i faith she loves me
othello now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
iago do you hear cassio
othello now he importunes him
 to tell it o'er go to well said well said
iago she gives it out that you shall marry hey
 do you intend it
cassio ha ha ha
othello do you triumph roman do you triumph
cassio i marry her what a customer prithee bear some
 charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome
 ha ha ha
othello so so so so they laugh that win
iago faith the cry goes that you shall marry her
cassio prithee say true
iago i am a very villain else
othello have you scored me well
cassio this is the monkey's own giving out she is
 persuaded i will marry her out of her own love and
 flattery not out of my promise
othello iago beckons me now he begins the story
cassio she was here even now she haunts me in every place
 i was the other day talking on the seabank with
 certain venetians and thither comes the bauble
 and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck
othello crying o dear cassio as it were his gesture
 imports it
cassio so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales
 and pulls me ha ha ha
othello now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber o
 i see that nose of yours but not that dog i shall
 throw it to
cassio well i must leave her company
iago before me look where she comes
cassio tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one
 enter bianca
 what do you mean by this haunting of me
bianca let the devil and his dam haunt you what did you
 mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now
 i was a fine fool to take it i must take out the
 worka likely piece of work that you should find
 it in your chamber and not know who left it there
 this is some minx's token and i must take out the
 work there give it your hobbyhorse wheresoever

othello o iago

 foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he
 hath given it his whore
othello i would have him nine years akilling
 a fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman
iago nay you must forget that
othello ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight
 for she shall not live no my heart is turned to
 stone i strike it and it hurts my hand o the
 world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by
 an emperor's side and command him tasks
iago nay that's not your way
othello hang her i do but say what she is so delicate
 with her needle an admirable musician o she
 will sing the savageness out of a bear of so high
 and plenteous wit and invention
iago she's the worse for all this
othello o a thousand thousand times and then of so
 gentle a condition

 and his own courses will denote him so
 that i may save my speech do but go after

 othello
act iv
scene ii a room in the castle
 enter othello and emilia
othello you have seen nothing then
emilia nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
othello yes you have seen cassio and she together
emilia but then i saw no harm and then i heard
 each syllable that breath made up between them
othello what did they never whisper
emilia never my lord
othello nor send you out o the way
emilia never
othello to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
emilia never my lord
othello that's strange
emilia i durst my lord to wager she is honest
 lay down my soul at stake if you think other
 remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
 if any wretch have put this in your head
 let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse
 for if she be not honest chaste and true
 there's no man happy the purest of their wives
 is foul as slander
othello bid her come hither go
 exit emilia
 she says enough yet she's a simple bawd
 that cannot say as much this is a subtle whore
 a closet lock and key of villanous secrets
 and yet she'll kneel and pray i have seen her do't
 enter desdemona with emilia
desdemona my lord what is your will
othello pray chuck come hither
desdemona what is your pleasure
othello let me see your eyes
 look in my face
desdemona what horrible fancy's this
othello to emilia some of your function mistress
 leave procreants alone and shut the door
 cough or cry hem if any body come
 your mystery your mystery nay dispatch
 exit emilia
desdemona upon my knees what doth your speech import
 i understand a fury in your words
 but not the words
othello why what art thou
desdemona your wife my lord your true
 and loyal wife
othello come swear it damn thyself
 lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
 should fear to seize thee therefore be double damn'd
 swear thou art honest
desdemona heaven doth truly know it
othello heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
desdemona to whom my lord with whom how am i false
othello o desdemona away away away
desdemona alas the heavy day why do you weep
 am i the motive of these tears my lord
 if haply you my father do suspect
 an instrument of this your calling back
 lay not your blame on me if you have lost him
 why i have lost him too
othello had it pleased heaven
 to try me with affliction had they rain'd
 all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
 steep'd me in poverty to the very lips
 given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
 i should have found in some place of my soul
 a drop of patience but alas to make me
 a fixed figure for the time of scorn
 to point his slow unmoving finger at
 yet could i bear that too well very well
 but there where i have garner'd up my heart
 where either i must live or bear no life
 the fountain from the which my current runs
 or else dries up to be discarded thence
 or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
 to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there
 patience thou young and roselipp'd cherubin
 ay there look grim as hell
desdemona i hope my noble lord esteems me honest
othello o ay as summer flies are in the shambles
 that quicken even with blowing o thou weed
 who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
 that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst
 ne'er been born
desdemona alas what ignorant sin have i committed
othello was this fair paper this most goodly book
 made to write whore upon what committed
 committed o thou public commoner
 i should make very forges of my cheeks
 that would to cinders burn up modesty
 did i but speak thy deeds what committed
 heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
 the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
 is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth
 and will not hear it what committed
 impudent strumpet
desdemona by heaven you do me wrong
othello are you not a strumpet
desdemona no as i am a christian

 he might have chid me so for in good faith
 i am a child to chiding
iago what's the matter lady
emilia alas iago my lord hath so bewhored her
 thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
 as true hearts cannot bear
desdemona am i that name iago
iago what name fair lady
desdemona such as she says my lord did say i was
emilia he call'd her whore a beggar in his drink
 could not have laid such terms upon his callat
iago why did he so
desdemona i do not know i am sure i am none such
iago do not weep do not weep alas the day
emilia hath she forsook so many noble matches
 her father and her country and her friends
 to be call'd whore would it not make one weep
desdemona it is my wretched fortune
iago beshrew him for't
 how comes this trick upon him
desdemona nay heaven doth know
emilia i will be hang'd if some eternal villain
 some busy and insinuating rogue
 some cogging cozening slave to get some office
 have not devised this slander i'll be hang'd else
iago fie there is no such man it is impossible
desdemona if any such there be heaven pardon him
emilia a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones
 why should he call her whore who keeps her company
 what place what time what form what likelihood
 the moor's abused by some most villanous knave
 some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
 o heaven that such companions thou'ldst unfold
 and put in every honest hand a whip
 to lash the rascals naked through the world
 even from the east to the west
iago speak within door
emilia o fie upon them some such squire he was
 that turn'd your wit the seamy side without
 and made you to suspect me with the moor
iago you are a fool go to
desdemona o good iago
 what shall i do to win my lord again
 good friend go to him for by this light of heaven
 i know not how i lost him here i kneel
 if e'er my will did trespass gainst his love
 either in discourse of thought or actual deed
 or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
 delighted them in any other form
 or that i do not yet and ever did
 and ever willthough he do shake me off
 to beggarly divorcementlove him dearly
 comfort forswear me unkindness may do much
 and his unkindness may defeat my life
 but never taint my love i cannot say whore'
 it does abhor me now i speak the word
 to do the act that might the addition earn
 not the world's mass of vanity could make me
iago i pray you be content tis but his humour
 the business of the state does him offence
 and he does chide with you
desdemona if twere no other
iago tis but so i warrant
 trumpets within
 hark how these instruments summon to supper
 the messengers of venice stay the meat
 go in and weep not all things shall be well
 exeunt desdemona and emilia
 enter roderigo
 how now roderigo
roderigo i do not find that thou dealest justly with me
iago what in the contrary
roderigo every day thou daffest me with some device iago
 and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me
 all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
 advantage of hope i will indeed no longer endure
 it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what
 already i have foolishly suffered
iago will you hear me roderigo
roderigo faith i have heard too much for your words and
 performances are no kin together
iago you charge me most unjustly
roderigo with nought but truth i have wasted myself out of
 my means the jewels you have had from me to
 deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a
 votarist you have told me she hath received them
 and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
 respect and acquaintance but i find none
iago well go to very well
roderigo very well go to i cannot go to man nor tis
 not very well nay i think it is scurvy and begin
 to find myself fobbed in it
iago very well
roderigo i tell you tis not very well i will make myself
 known to desdemona if she will return me my
 jewels i will give over my suit and repent my
 unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i
 will seek satisfaction of you
iago you have said now
roderigo ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing
iago why now i see there's mettle in thee and even from
 this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
 ever before give me thy hand roderigo thou hast
 taken against me a most just exception but yet i
 protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair
roderigo it hath not appeared
iago i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your
 suspicion is not without wit and judgment but
 roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i
 have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean
 purpose courage and valour this night show it if
 thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona
 take me from this world with treachery and devise
 engines for my life
roderigo well what is it is it within reason and compass
iago sir there is especial commission come from venice
 to depute cassio in othello's place
roderigo is that true why then othello and desdemona
 return again to venice
iago o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with
 him the fair desdemona unless his abode be
 lingered here by some accident wherein none can be
 so determinate as the removing of cassio
roderigo how do you mean removing of him
iago why by making him uncapable of othello's place
 knocking out his brains
roderigo and that you would have me to do
iago ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right
 he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i
 go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable
 fortune if you will watch his going thence which
 i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one
 you may take him at your pleasure i will be near
 to second your attempt and he shall fall between
 us come stand not amazed at it but go along with
 me i will show you such a necessity in his death
 that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
 him it is now high suppertime and the night grows
 to waste about it
roderigo i will hear further reason for this
iago and you shall be satisfied

othello get you to bed on the instant i will be returned
 forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done
desdemona i will my lord
 exeunt othello lodovico and attendants
emilia how goes it now he looks gentler than he did
desdemona he says he will return incontinent
 he hath commanded me to go to bed
 and bade me to dismiss you
emilia dismiss me
desdemona it was his bidding therefore good emilia
 give me my nightly wearing and adieu
 we must not now displease him
emilia i would you had never seen him
desdemona so would not i my love doth so approve him
 that even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns
 prithee unpin mehave grace and favour in them
emilia i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
desdemona all's one good faith how foolish are our minds
 if i do die before thee prithee shroud me
 in one of those same sheets
emilia come come you talk
desdemona my mother had a maid call'd barbara
 she was in love and he she loved proved mad
 and did forsake her she had a song of willow'
 an old thing twas but it express'd her fortune
 and she died singing it that song tonight
 will not go from my mind i have much to do
 but to go hang my head all at one side
 and sing it like poor barbara prithee dispatch
emilia shall i go fetch your nightgown
desdemona no unpin me here
 this lodovico is a proper man
emilia a very handsome man
desdemona he speaks well
emilia i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot
 to palestine for a touch of his nether lip
desdemona singing the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree
 sing all a green willow
 her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
 sing willow willow willow
 the fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans
 sing willow willow willow
 her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones
 lay by these
 singing
 sing willow willow willow
 prithee hie thee he'll come anon
 singing
 sing all a green willow must be my garland
 let nobody blame him his scorn i approve
 nay that's not nexthark who is't that knocks
emilia it's the wind
desdemona singing i call'd my love false love but what
 said he then
 sing willow willow willow
 if i court moe women you'll couch with moe men
 so get thee gone good night ate eyes do itch
 doth that bode weeping
emilia tis neither here nor there
desdemona i have heard it said so o these men these men
 dost thou in conscience thinktell me emilia
 that there be women do abuse their husbands
 in such gross kind
emilia there be some such no question
desdemona wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
emilia why would not you
desdemona no by this heavenly light
emilia nor i neither by this heavenly light
 i might do't as well i the dark
desdemona wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
emilia the world's a huge thing it is a great price
 for a small vice
desdemona in troth i think thou wouldst not
emilia in troth i think i should and undo't when i had
 done marry i would not do such a thing for a
 jointring nor for measures of lawn nor for
 gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty
 exhibition but for the whole worldwhy who would
 not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
 monarch i should venture purgatory for't
desdemona beshrew me if i would do such a wrong
 for the whole world
emilia why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and
 having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your
 own world and you might quickly make it right
desdemona i do not think there is any such woman
emilia yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would
 store the world they played for
 but i do think it is their husbands faults
 if wives do fall say that they slack their duties
 and pour our treasures into foreign laps
 or else break out in peevish jealousies
 throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
 or scant our former having in despite
 why we have galls and though we have some grace
 yet have we some revenge let husbands know
 their wives have sense like them they see and smell
 and have their palates both for sweet and sour
 as husbands have what is it that they do
 when they change us for others is it sport
 i think it is and doth affection breed it
 i think it doth is't frailty that thus errs
 it is so too and have not we affections
 desires for sport and frailty as men have
 then let them use us well else let them know
 the ills we do their ills instruct us so
desdemona good night good night heaven me such uses send
 not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend

act v
scene ii a bedchamber in the castle desdemona in bed asleep
 a light burning
 enter othello
othello it is the cause it is the cause my soul
 let me not name it to you you chaste stars
 it is the cause yet i'll not shed her blood
 nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
 and smooth as monumental alabaster
 yet she must die else she'll betray more men
 put out the light and then put out the light
 if i quench thee thou flaming minister
 i can again thy former light restore
 should i repent me but once put out thy light
 thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature
 i know not where is that promethean heat
 that can thy light relume when i have pluck'd the rose
 i cannot give it vital growth again
 it must needs wither i'll smell it on the tree
 kissing her
 ah balmy breath that dost almost persuade
 justice to break her sword one more one more
 be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee
 and love thee after one more and this the last
 so sweet was ne'er so fatal i must weep
 but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly
 it strikes where it doth love she wakes
desdemona who's there othello
othello ay desdemona
desdemona will you come to bed my lord
othello have you pray'd tonight desdemona
desdemona ay my lord
othello if you bethink yourself of any crime
 unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace
 solicit for it straight
desdemona alas my lord what do you mean by that
othello well do it and be brief i will walk by
 i would not kill thy unprepared spirit
 no heaven forfend i would not kill thy soul
desdemona talk you of killing
othello ay i do
desdemona then heaven
 have mercy on me
othello amen with all my heart
desdemona if you say so i hope you will not kill me
othello hum
desdemona and yet i fear you for you are fatal then
 when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not
 since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear
othello think on thy sins
desdemona they are loves i bear to you
othello ay and for that thou diest
desdemona that death's unnatural that kills for loving
 alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
 some bloody passion shakes your very frame
 these are portents but yet i hope i hope
 they do not point on me
othello peace and be still
desdemona i will so what's the matter
othello that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee
 thou gavest to cassio
desdemona no by my life and soul
 send for the man and ask him
othello sweet soul take heed
 take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed
desdemona ay but not yet to die
othello yes presently
 therefore confess thee freely of thy sin
 for to deny each article with oath
 cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
 that i do groan withal thou art to die
desdemona then lord have mercy on me
othello i say amen
desdemona and have you mercy too i never did
 offend you in my life never loved cassio
 but with such general warranty of heaven
 as i might love i never gave him token
othello by heaven i saw my handkerchief in's hand
 o perjured woman thou dost stone my heart
 and makest me call what i intend to do
 a murder which i thought a sacrifice
 i saw the handkerchief
desdemona he found it then
 i never gave it him send for him hither
 let him confess a truth
othello he hath confess'd
desdemona what my lord
othello that he hath used thee
desdemona how unlawfully
othello ay
desdemona he will not say so
othello no his mouth is stopp'd
 honest iago hath ta'en order for't
desdemona o my fear interprets what is he dead
othello had all his hairs been lives my great revenge
 had stomach for them all
desdemona alas he is betray'd and i undone
othello out strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face
desdemona o banish me my lord but kill me not
othello down strumpet
desdemona kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
othello nay if you strive
desdemona but half an hour
othello being done there is no pause
desdemona but while i say one prayer
othello it is too late
 he stifles her
emilia within my lord my lord what ho my lord my lord
othello what noise is this not dead not yet quite dead
 i that am cruel am yet merciful
 i would not have thee linger in thy pain so so
emilia within what ho my lord my lord
othello who's there
emilia within o good my lord i would speak a word with you
othello yes tis emilia by and by she's dead
 tis like she comes to speak of cassio's death
 the noise was here ha no more moving
 still as the grave shall she come in were't good
 i think she stirs againno what's best to do
 if she come in she'll sure speak to my wife
 my wife my wife what wife i have no wife
 o insupportable o heavy hour
 methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
 of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
 should yawn at alteration
emilia within i do beseech you
 that i may speak with you o good my lord
othello i had forgot thee o come in emilia
 soft by and by let me the curtains draw
 where art thou
 unlocks the door

 and makes men mad
emilia cassio my lord hath kill'd a young venetian
 call'd roderigo
othello roderigo kill'd
 and cassio kill'd
emilia no cassio is not kill'd

othello that what
emilia out and alas that was my lady's voice
 help help ho help o lady speak again
 sweet desdemona o sweet mistress speak
desdemona a guiltless death i die
emilia o who hath done this deed
desdemona nobody i myself farewell

othello why how should she be murder'd
emilia alas who knows
othello you heard her say herself it was not i
emilia she said so i must needs report the truth
othello she's like a liar gone to burning hell
 twas i that kill'd her
emilia o the more angel she
 and you the blacker devil
othello she turn'd to folly and she was a whore
emilia thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
othello she was false as water
emilia thou art rash as fire to say
 that she was false o she was heavenly true
othello cassio did top her ask thy husband else
 o i were damn'd beneath all depth in hell
 but that i did proceed upon just grounds
 to this extremity thy husband knew it all
emilia my husband
othello thy husband
emilia that she was false to wedlock
othello ay with cassio nay had she been true
 if heaven would make me such another world
 of one entire and perfect chrysolite
 i'ld not have sold her for it
emilia my husband
othello ay twas he that told me first
 an honest man he is and hates the slime
 that sticks on filthy deeds

 this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
 than thou wast worthy her
othello peace you were best
emilia thou hast not half that power to do me harm

 for thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
 that e'er did lift up eye
othello rising o she was foul
 i scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece
 whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd
 i know this act shows horrible and grim
gratiano poor desdemona i am glad thy father's dead
 thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
 shore his old thread in twain did he live now
 this sight would make him do a desperate turn
 yea curse his better angel from his side
 and fall to reprobation
othello tis pitiful but yet iago knows
 that she with cassio hath the act of shame
 a thousand times committed cassio confess'd it
 and she did gratify his amorous works
 with that recognizance and pledge of love
 which i first gave her i saw it in his hand
 it was a handkerchief an antique token
 my father gave my mother
emilia o heaven o heavenly powers
iago come hold your peace
emilia twill out twill out i peace
 no i will speak as liberal as the north
 let heaven and men and devils let them all
 all all cry shame against me yet i'll speak
iago be wise and get you home
emilia i will not
 iago offers to stab emilia
gratiano fie
 your sword upon a woman
emilia o thou dull moor that handkerchief thou speak'st of
 i found by fortune and did give my husband
 for often with a solemn earnestness
 more than indeed belong'd to such a trifle
 he begg'd of me to steal it
iago villanous whore
emilia she give it cassio no alas i found it
 and i did give't my husband
iago filth thou liest
emilia by heaven i do not i do not gentlemen
 o murderous coxcomb what should such a fool
 do with so good a woman
othello are there no stones in heaven
 but what serve for the thunderprecious villain
 he runs at iago iago from behind stabs emilia and exit
gratiano the woman falls sure he hath kill'd his wife
emilia ay ay o lay me by my mistress side
gratiano he's gone but his wife's kill'd
montano tis a notorious villain take you this weapon
 which i have here recover'd from the moor
 come guard the door without let him not pass
 but kill him rather i'll after that same villain
 for tis a damned slave
 exeunt montano and gratiano
othello i am not valiant neither
 but ever puny whipster gets my sword
 but why should honour outlive honesty
 let it go all
emilia what did thy song bode lady
 hark canst thou hear me i will play the swan
 and die in music
 singing

 so come my soul to bliss as i speak true
 so speaking as i think i die i die

othello i have another weapon in this chamber
 it is a sword of spain the icebrook's temper
 o here it is uncle i must come forth
gratiano within if thou attempt it it will cost thee dear
 thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer
othello look in upon me then and speak with me
 or naked as i am i will assault thee
 reenter gratiano
gratiano what is the matter
othello behold i have a weapon
 a better never did itself sustain
 upon a soldier's thigh i have seen the day
 that with this little arm and this good sword
 i have made my way through more impediments
 than twenty times your stop but o vain boast
 who can control his fate tis not so now
 be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd
 here is my journey's end here is my butt
 and very seamark of my utmost sail
 do you go back dismay'd tis a lost fear
 man but a rush against othello's breast
 and he retires where should othello go
 now how dost thou look now o illstarr'd wench
 pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt
 this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven
 and fiends will snatch at it cold cold my girl
 even like thy chastity o cursed slave
 whip me ye devils
 from the possession of this heavenly sight
 blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur
 wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire
 o desdemona desdemona dead
 oh oh oh
 enter lodovico montano cassio carried in a chair
 and officers with iago prisoner
lodovico where is this rash and most unfortunate man
othello that's he that was othello here i am
lodovico where is that viper bring the villain forth
othello i look down towards his feet but that's a fable
 if that thou best a devil i cannot kill thee
 wounds iago
lodovico wrench his sword from him
iago i bleed sir but not kill'd
othello i am not sorry neither i'ld have thee live
 for in my sense tis happiness to die
lodovico o thou othello thou wert once so good
 fall'n in the practise of a damned slave
 what shall be said to thee
othello why any thing
 an honourable murderer if you will
 for nought i did in hate but all in honour
lodovico this wretch hath part confess'd his villany
 did you and he consent in cassio's death
othello ay
cassio dear general i never gave you cause
othello i do believe it and i ask your pardon
 will you i pray demand that demidevil
 why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
iago demand me nothing what you know you know
 from this time forth i never will speak word
lodovico what not to pray
gratiano torments will ope your lips
othello well thou dost best
lodovico sir you shall understand what hath befall'n
 which as i think you know not here is a letter
 found in the pocket of the slain roderigo
 and here another the one of them imports
 the death of cassio to be undertook
 by roderigo
othello o villain
cassio most heathenish and most gross
lodovico now here's another discontented paper
 found in his pocket too and this it seems
 roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
 but that belike iago in the interim
 came in and satisfied him
othello o the pernicious caitiff
 how came you cassio by that handkerchief
 that was my wife's
cassio i found it in my chamber
 and he himself confess'd but even now
 that there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
 which wrought to his desire
othello o fool fool fool
cassio there is besides in roderigo's letter
 how he upbraids iago that he made him
 brave me upon the watch whereon it came
 that i was cast and even but now he spake
 after long seeming dead iago hurt him
 iago set him on
lodovico you must forsake this room and go with us
 your power and your command is taken off
 and cassio rules in cyprus for this slave
 if there be any cunning cruelty
 that can torment him much and hold him long
 it shall be his you shall close prisoner rest
 till that the nature of your fault be known
 to the venetian state come bring him away
othello soft you a word or two before you go
 i have done the state some service and they know't
 no more of that i pray you in your letters
 when you shall these unlucky deeds relate
 speak of me as i am nothing extenuate
 nor set down aught in malice then must you speak
 of one that loved not wisely but too well
 of one not easily jealous but being wrought
 perplex'd in the extreme of one whose hand
 like the base indian threw a pearl away
 richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes
 albeit unused to the melting mood
 drop tears as fast as the arabian trees
 their medicinal gum set you down this
 and say besides that in aleppo once
 where a malignant and a turban'd turk
 beat a venetian and traduced the state
 i took by the throat the circumcised dog
 and smote him thus
 stabs himself
lodovico o bloody period
gratiano all that's spoke is marr'd
othello i kiss'd thee ere i kill'd thee no way but this
 killing myself to die upon a kiss
 falls on the bed and dies
cassio this did i fear but thought he had no weapon
 for he was great of heart
lodovico to iago o spartan dog
 more fell than anguish hunger or the sea
 look on the tragic loading of this bed
 this is thy work the object poisons sight
 let it be hid gratiano keep the house
 and seize upon the fortunes of the moor
 for they succeed on you to you lord governor
 remains the censure of this hellish villain
 the time the place the torture o enforce it
 myself will straight aboard and to the state
 this heavy act with heavy heart relate

 romeo and juliet
 prologue
 two households both alike in dignity
 in fair verona where we lay our scene
 from ancient grudge break to new mutiny
 where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
 from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
 a pair of starcross'd lovers take their life
 whole misadventured piteous overthrows
 do with their death bury their parents strife
 the fearful passage of their deathmark'd love
 and the continuance of their parents rage
 which but their children's end nought could remove
 is now the two hours traffic of our stage
 the which if you with patient ears attend
 what here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend
 romeo and juliet

gregory that shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes

lady montague thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe
 enter prince with attendants
prince rebellious subjects enemies to peace
 profaners of this neighbourstained steel
 will they not hear what ho you men you beasts
 that quench the fire of your pernicious rage
 with purple fountains issuing from your veins
 on pain of torture from those bloody hands
 throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground
 and hear the sentence of your moved prince
 three civil brawls bred of an airy word
 by thee old capulet and montague
 have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
 and made verona's ancient citizens
 cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
 to wield old partisans in hands as old
 canker'd with peace to part your canker'd hate
 if ever you disturb our streets again
 your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
 for this time all the rest depart away
 you capulet shall go along with me
 and montague come you this afternoon
 to know our further pleasure in this case
 to old freetown our common judgmentplace
 once more on pain of death all men depart
 exeunt all but montague lady montague and benvolio
montague who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
 speak nephew were you by when it began
benvolio here were the servants of your adversary
 and yours close fighting ere i did approach
 i drew to part them in the instant came
 the fiery tybalt with his sword prepared
 which as he breathed defiance to my ears
 he swung about his head and cut the winds
 who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn
 while we were interchanging thrusts and blows
 came more and more and fought on part and part
 till the prince came who parted either part
lady montague o where is romeo saw you him today
 right glad i am he was not at this fray
benvolio madam an hour before the worshipp'd sun
 peer'd forth the golden window of the east
 a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
 where underneath the grove of sycamore
 that westward rooteth from the city's side
 so early walking did i see your son
 towards him i made but he was ware of me
 and stole into the covert of the wood
 i measuring his affections by my own
 that most are busied when they're most alone
 pursued my humour not pursuing his
 and gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me
montague many a morning hath he there been seen
 with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew
 adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
 but all so soon as the allcheering sun
 should in the furthest east begin to draw
 the shady curtains from aurora's bed
 away from the light steals home my heavy son
 and private in his chamber pens himself
 shuts up his windows locks far daylight out
 and makes himself an artificial night
 black and portentous must this humour prove
 unless good counsel may the cause remove
benvolio my noble uncle do you know the cause
montague i neither know it nor can learn of him
benvolio have you importuned him by any means
montague both by myself and many other friends
 but he his own affections counsellor
 is to himselfi will not say how true
 but to himself so secret and so close
 so far from sounding and discovery
 as is the bud bit with an envious worm
 ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
 or dedicate his beauty to the sun
 could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
 we would as willingly give cure as know
 enter romeo
benvolio see where he comes so please you step aside
 i'll know his grievance or be much denied
montague i would thou wert so happy by thy stay
 to hear true shrift come madam let's away
 exeunt montague and lady montague
benvolio goodmorrow cousin
romeo is the day so young
benvolio but new struck nine
romeo ay me sad hours seem long
 was that my father that went hence so fast
benvolio it was what sadness lengthens romeo's hours
romeo not having that which having makes them short
benvolio in love
romeo out
benvolio of love
romeo out of her favour where i am in love
benvolio alas that love so gentle in his view
 should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
romeo alas that love whose view is muffled still
 should without eyes see pathways to his will
 where shall we dine o me what fray was here
 yet tell me not for i have heard it all
 here's much to do with hate but more with love
 why then o brawling love o loving hate
 o any thing of nothing first create
 o heavy lightness serious vanity
 misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
 feather of lead bright smoke cold fire
 sick health
 stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
 this love feel i that feel no love in this
 dost thou not laugh
benvolio no coz i rather weep
romeo good heart at what
benvolio at thy good heart's oppression
romeo why such is love's transgression
 griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
 which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
 with more of thine this love that thou hast shown
 doth add more grief to too much of mine own
 love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs
 being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
 being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers tears
 what is it else a madness most discreet
 a choking gall and a preserving sweet
 farewell my coz
benvolio soft i will go along
 an if you leave me so you do me wrong
romeo tut i have lost myself i am not here
 this is not romeo he's some other where
benvolio tell me in sadness who is that you love
romeo what shall i groan and tell thee
benvolio groan why no
 but sadly tell me who
romeo bid a sick man in sadness make his will
 ah word ill urged to one that is so ill
 in sadness cousin i do love a woman
benvolio i aim'd so near when i supposed you loved
romeo a right good markman and she's fair i love
benvolio a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
romeo well in that hit you miss she'll not be hit
 with cupid's arrow she hath dian's wit
 and in strong proof of chastity well arm'd
 from love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd
 she will not stay the siege of loving terms
 nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes
 nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
 o she is rich in beauty only poor
 that when she dies with beauty dies her store
benvolio then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
romeo she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
 for beauty starved with her severity
 cuts beauty off from all posterity
 she is too fair too wise wisely too fair
 to merit bliss by making me despair
 she hath forsworn to love and in that vow
 do i live dead that live to tell it now
benvolio be ruled by me forget to think of her
romeo o teach me how i should forget to think
benvolio by giving liberty unto thine eyes
 examine other beauties
romeo tis the way
 to call hers exquisite in question more
 these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
 being black put us in mind they hide the fair
 he that is strucken blind cannot forget
 the precious treasure of his eyesight lost
 show me a mistress that is passing fair
 what doth her beauty serve but as a note
 where i may read who pass'd that passing fair
 farewell thou canst not teach me to forget
benvolio i'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt

 when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
 of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
 to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
 shake quoth the dovehouse twas no need i trow
 to bid me trudge
 and since that time it is eleven years
 for then she could stand alone nay by the rood
 she could have run and waddled all about
 for even the day before she broke her brow
 and then my husbandgod be with his soul

lady capulet enough of this i pray thee hold thy peace
nurse yes madam yet i cannot choose but laugh
 to think it should leave crying and say ay'

 a bump as big as a young cockerel's stone
 a parlous knock and it cried bitterly
 yea quoth my husband'fall'st upon thy face
 thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
 wilt thou not jule it stinted and said ay'
juliet and stint thou too i pray thee nurse say i
nurse peace i have done god mark thee to his grace

 i came to talk of tell me daughter juliet
 how stands your disposition to be married
juliet it is an honour that i dream not of
nurse an honour were not i thine only nurse
 i would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat
lady capulet well think of marriage now younger than you
 here in verona ladies of esteem
 are made already mothers by my count
 i was your mother much upon these years
 that you are now a maid thus then in brief
 the valiant paris seeks you for his love
nurse a man young lady lady such a man
 as all the worldwhy he's a man of wax
lady capulet verona's summer hath not such a flower
nurse nay he's a flower in faith a very flower
lady capulet what say you can you love the gentleman
 this night you shall behold him at our feast
 read o'er the volume of young paris face
 and find delight writ there with beauty's pen
 examine every married lineament
 and see how one another lends content
 and what obscured in this fair volume lies
 find written in the margent of his eyes
 this precious book of love this unbound lover
 to beautify him only lacks a cover
 the fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
 for fair without the fair within to hide
 that book in many's eyes doth share the glory
 that in gold clasps locks in the golden story
 so shall you share all that he doth possess
 by having him making yourself no less
nurse no less nay bigger women grow by men
lady capulet speak briefly can you like of paris love
juliet i'll look to like if looking liking move
 but no more deep will i endart mine eye
 than your consent gives strength to make it fly

scene iv a street
 enter romeo mercutio benvolio with five or six
 maskers torchbearers and others
romeo what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
 or shall we on without a apology
benvolio the date is out of such prolixity
 we'll have no cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf
 bearing a tartar's painted bow of lath
 scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
 nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
 after the prompter for our entrance
 but let them measure us by what they will
 we'll measure them a measure and be gone
romeo give me a torch i am not for this ambling
 being but heavy i will bear the light
mercutio nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
romeo not i believe me you have dancing shoes
 with nimble soles i have a soul of lead
 so stakes me to the ground i cannot move
mercutio you are a lover borrow cupid's wings
 and soar with them above a common bound
romeo i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
 to soar with his light feathers and so bound
 i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
 under love's heavy burden do i sink
mercutio and to sink in it should you burden love
 too great oppression for a tender thing
romeo is love a tender thing it is too rough
 too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
mercutio if love be rough with you be rough with love
 prick love for pricking and you beat love down
 give me a case to put my visage in
 a visor for a visor what care i
 what curious eye doth quote deformities
 here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
benvolio come knock and enter and no sooner in
 but every man betake him to his legs
romeo a torch for me let wantons light of heart
 tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
 for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase
 i'll be a candleholder and look on
 the game was ne'er so fair and i am done
mercutio tut dun's the mouse the constable's own word
 if thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire
 of this sirreverence love wherein thou stick'st
 up to the ears come we burn daylight ho
romeo nay that's not so
mercutio i mean sir in delay
 we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
 take our good meaning for our judgment sits
 five times in that ere once in our five wits
romeo and we mean well in going to this mask
 but tis no wit to go
mercutio why may one ask
romeo i dream'd a dream tonight
mercutio and so did i
romeo well what was yours
mercutio that dreamers often lie
romeo in bed asleep while they do dream things true
mercutio o then i see queen mab hath been with you
 she is the fairies midwife and she comes
 in shape no bigger than an agatestone
 on the forefinger of an alderman
 drawn with a team of little atomies
 athwart men's noses as they lie asleep
 her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs
 the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
 the traces of the smallest spider's web
 the collars of the moonshine's watery beams
 her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film
 her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
 not so big as a round little worm
 prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid
 her chariot is an empty hazelnut
 made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
 time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
 and in this state she gallops night by night
 through lovers brains and then they dream of love
 o'er courtiers knees that dream on court'sies straight
 o'er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
 o'er ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream
 which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
 because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
 sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose
 and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
 and sometime comes she with a tithepig's tail
 tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep
 then dreams he of another benefice
 sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck
 and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
 of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
 of healths fivefathom deep and then anon
 drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
 and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
 and sleeps again this is that very mab
 that plats the manes of horses in the night
 and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
 which once untangled much misfortune bodes
 this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
 that presses them and learns them first to bear
 making them women of good carriage
 this is she
romeo peace peace mercutio peace
 thou talk'st of nothing
mercutio true i talk of dreams
 which are the children of an idle brain
 begot of nothing but vain fantasy
 which is as thin of substance as the air
 and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
 even now the frozen bosom of the north
 and being anger'd puffs away from thence
 turning his face to the dewdropping south
benvolio this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
 supper is done and we shall come too late
romeo i fear too early for my mind misgives
 some consequence yet hanging in the stars
 shall bitterly begin his fearful date
 with this night's revels and expire the term
 of a despised life closed in my breast
 by some vile forfeit of untimely death
 but he that hath the steerage of my course
 direct my sail on lusty gentlemen
benvolio strike drum

 come pentecost as quickly as it will
 some five and twenty years and then we mask'd
second capulet tis more tis more his son is elder sir
 his son is thirty
capulet will you tell me that
 his son was but a ward two years ago
romeo to a servingman what lady is that which doth
 enrich the hand
 of yonder knight
servant i know not sir
romeo o she doth teach the torches to burn bright
 it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
 like a rich jewel in an ethiope's ear
 beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
 so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
 as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows
 the measure done i'll watch her place of stand
 and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
 did my heart love till now forswear it sight
 for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night
tybalt this by his voice should be a montague
 fetch me my rapier boy what dares the slave
 come hither cover'd with an antic face
 to fleer and scorn at our solemnity
 now by the stock and honour of my kin
 to strike him dead i hold it not a sin
capulet why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so
tybalt uncle this is a montague our foe
 a villain that is hither come in spite
 to scorn at our solemnity this night
capulet young romeo is it
tybalt tis he that villain romeo
capulet content thee gentle coz let him alone
 he bears him like a portly gentleman
 and to say truth verona brags of him
 to be a virtuous and wellgovern'd youth
 i would not for the wealth of all the town
 here in my house do him disparagement
 therefore be patient take no note of him
 it is my will the which if thou respect
 show a fair presence and put off these frowns
 and illbeseeming semblance for a feast

 now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall
 exit
romeo to juliet if i profane with my unworthiest hand
 this holy shrine the gentle fine is this
 my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
 to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
juliet good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
 which mannerly devotion shows in this
 for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
 and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
romeo have not saints lips and holy palmers too
juliet ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
romeo o then dear saint let lips do what hands do
 they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
juliet saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
romeo then move not while my prayer's effect i take
 thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged
juliet then have my lips the sin that they have took
romeo sin from thy lips o trespass sweetly urged
 give me my sin again
juliet you kiss by the book
nurse madam your mother craves a word with you

act ii
 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
 and young affection gapes to be his heir
 that fair for which love groan'd for and would die
 with tender juliet match'd is now not fair
 now romeo is beloved and loves again
 alike betwitched by the charm of looks
 but to his foe supposed he must complain
 and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks
 being held a foe he may not have access
 to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
 and she as much in love her means much less
 to meet her newbeloved any where
 but passion lends them power time means to meet
 tempering extremities with extreme sweet

act ii
scene i a lane by the wall of capulet's orchard
 enter romeo
romeo can i go forward when my heart is here
 turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
 he climbs the wall and leaps down within it
 enter benvolio and mercutio
benvolio romeo my cousin romeo
mercutio he is wise
 and on my lie hath stol'n him home to bed
benvolio he ran this way and leap'd this orchard wall
 call good mercutio
mercutio nay i'll conjure too
 romeo humours madman passion lover
 appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
 speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied
 cry but ay me pronounce but love and dove'
 speak to my gossip venus one fair word
 one nickname for her purblind son and heir
 young adam cupid he that shot so trim
 when king cophetua loved the beggarmaid
 he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
 the ape is dead and i must conjure him
 i conjure thee by rosaline's bright eyes
 by her high forehead and her scarlet lip
 by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
 and the demesnes that there adjacent lie
 that in thy likeness thou appear to us
benvolio and if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
mercutio this cannot anger him twould anger him
 to raise a spirit in his mistress circle
 of some strange nature letting it there stand
 till she had laid it and conjured it down
 that were some spite my invocation
 is fair and honest and in his mistress name
 i conjure only but to raise up him
benvolio come he hath hid himself among these trees
 to be consorted with the humorous night
 blind is his love and best befits the dark
mercutio if love be blind love cannot hit the mark
 now will he sit under a medlar tree
 and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
 as maids call medlars when they laugh alone
 romeo that she were o that she were
 an open et caetera thou a poperin pear
 romeo good night i'll to my trucklebed
 this fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep
 come shall we go
benvolio go then for tis in vain
 to seek him here that means not to be found
 exeunt
 romeo and juliet
act ii
scene ii capulet's orchard
 enter romeo
romeo he jests at scars that never felt a wound
 juliet appears above at a window
 but soft what light through yonder window breaks
 it is the east and juliet is the sun
 arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
 who is already sick and pale with grief
 that thou her maid art far more fair than she
 be not her maid since she is envious
 her vestal livery is but sick and green
 and none but fools do wear it cast it off
 it is my lady o it is my love
 o that she knew she were
 she speaks yet she says nothing what of that
 her eye discourses i will answer it
 i am too bold tis not to me she speaks
 two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
 having some business do entreat her eyes
 to twinkle in their spheres till they return
 what if her eyes were there they in her head
 the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
 as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
 would through the airy region stream so bright
 that birds would sing and think it were not night
 see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
 o that i were a glove upon that hand
 that i might touch that cheek
juliet ay me
romeo she speaks
 o speak again bright angel for thou art
 as glorious to this night being o'er my head
 as is a winged messenger of heaven
 unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
 of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
 when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
 and sails upon the bosom of the air
juliet o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
 deny thy father and refuse thy name
 or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
 and i'll no longer be a capulet
romeo aside shall i hear more or shall i speak at this
juliet tis but thy name that is my enemy
 thou art thyself though not a montague
 what's montague it is nor hand nor foot
 nor arm nor face nor any other part
 belonging to a man o be some other name
 what's in a name that which we call a rose
 by any other name would smell as sweet
 so romeo would were he not romeo call'd
 retain that dear perfection which he owes
 without that title romeo doff thy name
 and for that name which is no part of thee
 take all myself
romeo i take thee at thy word
 call me but love and i'll be new baptized
 henceforth i never will be romeo
juliet what man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
 so stumblest on my counsel
romeo by a name
 i know not how to tell thee who i am
 my name dear saint is hateful to myself
 because it is an enemy to thee
 had i it written i would tear the word
juliet my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
 of that tongue's utterance yet i know the sound
 art thou not romeo and a montague
romeo neither fair saint if either thee dislike
juliet how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
 the orchard walls are high and hard to climb
 and the place death considering who thou art
 if any of my kinsmen find thee here
romeo with love's light wings did i o'erperch these walls
 for stony limits cannot hold love out
 and what love can do that dares love attempt
 therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
juliet if they do see thee they will murder thee
romeo alack there lies more peril in thine eye
 than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
 and i am proof against their enmity
juliet i would not for the world they saw thee here
romeo i have night's cloak to hide me from their sight
 and but thou love me let them find me here
 my life were better ended by their hate
 than death prorogued wanting of thy love
juliet by whose direction found'st thou out this place
romeo by love who first did prompt me to inquire
 he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
 i am no pilot yet wert thou as far
 as that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea
 i would adventure for such merchandise
juliet thou know'st the mask of night is on my face
 else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
 for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
 fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny
 what i have spoke but farewell compliment
 dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay'
 and i will take thy word yet if thou swear'st
 thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
 then say jove laughs o gentle romeo
 if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
 or if thou think'st i am too quickly won
 i'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay
 so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
 in truth fair montague i am too fond
 and therefore thou mayst think my havior light
 but trust me gentleman i'll prove more true
 than those that have more cunning to be strange
 i should have been more strange i must confess
 but that thou overheard'st ere i was ware
 my true love's passion therefore pardon me
 and not impute this yielding to light love
 which the dark night hath so discovered
romeo lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
 that tips with silver all these fruittree tops
juliet o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
 that monthly changes in her circled orb
 lest that thy love prove likewise variable
romeo what shall i swear by
juliet do not swear at all
 or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
 which is the god of my idolatry
 and i'll believe thee
romeo if my heart's dear love
juliet well do not swear although i joy in thee
 i have no joy of this contract tonight
 it is too rash too unadvised too sudden
 too like the lightning which doth cease to be
 ere one can say it lightens sweet good night
 this bud of love by summer's ripening breath
 may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
 good night good night as sweet repose and rest
 come to thy heart as that within my breast
romeo o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
juliet what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
romeo the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine
juliet i gave thee mine before thou didst request it
 and yet i would it were to give again
romeo wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love
juliet but to be frank and give it thee again
 and yet i wish but for the thing i have
 my bounty is as boundless as the sea
 my love as deep the more i give to thee
 the more i have for both are infinite
 nurse calls within
 i hear some noise within dear love adieu
 anon good nurse sweet montague be true
 stay but a little i will come again
 exit above
romeo o blessed blessed night i am afeard
 being in night all this is but a dream
 too flatteringsweet to be substantial
 reenter juliet above
juliet three words dear romeo and good night indeed
 if that thy bent of love be honourable
 thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow
 by one that i'll procure to come to thee
 where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
 and all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay
 and follow thee my lord throughout the world
nurse within madam
juliet i come anonbut if thou mean'st not well
 i do beseech thee
nurse within madam
juliet by and by i come
 to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
 tomorrow will i send
romeo so thrive my soul
juliet a thousand times good night
 exit above
romeo a thousand times the worse to want thy light
 love goes toward love as schoolboys from
 their books
 but love from love toward school with heavy looks
 retiring
 reenter juliet above
juliet hist romeo hist o for a falconer's voice
 to lure this tasselgentle back again
 bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
 else would i tear the cave where echo lies
 and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
 with repetition of my romeo's name
romeo it is my soul that calls upon my name
 how silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
 like softest music to attending ears
juliet romeo
romeo my dear
juliet at what o'clock tomorrow
 shall i send to thee
romeo at the hour of nine
juliet i will not fail tis twenty years till then
 i have forgot why i did call thee back
romeo let me stand here till thou remember it
juliet i shall forget to have thee still stand there
 remembering how i love thy company
romeo and i'll still stay to have thee still forget
 forgetting any other home but this
juliet tis almost morning i would have thee gone
 and yet no further than a wanton's bird
 who lets it hop a little from her hand
 like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
 and with a silk thread plucks it back again
 so lovingjealous of his liberty
romeo i would i were thy bird
juliet sweet so would i
 yet i should kill thee with much cherishing
 good night good night parting is such
 sweet sorrow
 that i shall say good night till it be morrow
 exit above
romeo sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
 would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
 hence will i to my ghostly father's cell
 his help to crave and my dear hap to tell
 exit
 romeo and juliet
act ii
scene iii friar laurence's cell
 enter friar laurence with a basket
friar laurence the greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night
 chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
 and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
 from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels
 now ere the sun advance his burning eye
 the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry
 i must upfill this osier cage of ours
 with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
 the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb
 what is her burying grave that is her womb
 and from her womb children of divers kind
 we sucking on her natural bosom find
 many for many virtues excellent
 none but for some and yet all different
 o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
 in herbs plants stones and their true qualities
 for nought so vile that on the earth doth live
 but to the earth some special good doth give
 nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
 revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
 virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
 and vice sometimes by action dignified
 within the infant rind of this small flower
 poison hath residence and medicine power
 for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
 being tasted slays all senses with the heart
 two such opposed kings encamp them still
 in man as well as herbs grace and rude will
 and where the worser is predominant
 full soon the canker death eats up that plant
 enter romeo
romeo good morrow father
friar laurence benedicite
 what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
 young son it argues a distemper'd head
 so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
 care keeps his watch in every old man's eye
 and where care lodges sleep will never lie
 but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
 doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
 therefore thy earliness doth me assure
 thou art uproused by some distemperature
 or if not so then here i hit it right
 our romeo hath not been in bed tonight
romeo that last is true the sweeter rest was mine
friar laurence god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline
romeo with rosaline my ghostly father no
 i have forgot that name and that name's woe
friar laurence that's my good son but where hast thou been then
romeo i'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
 i have been feasting with mine enemy
 where on a sudden one hath wounded me
 that's by me wounded both our remedies
 within thy help and holy physic lies
 i bear no hatred blessed man for lo
 my intercession likewise steads my foe
friar laurence be plain good son and homely in thy drift
 riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
romeo then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
 on the fair daughter of rich capulet
 as mine on hers so hers is set on mine
 and all combined save what thou must combine
 by holy marriage when and where and how
 we met we woo'd and made exchange of vow
 i'll tell thee as we pass but this i pray
 that thou consent to marry us today
friar laurence holy saint francis what a change is here
 is rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
 so soon forsaken young men's love then lies
 not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
 jesu maria what a deal of brine
 hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
 how much salt water thrown away in waste
 to season love that of it doth not taste
 the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
 thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
 lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
 of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet
 if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine
 thou and these woes were all for rosaline
 and art thou changed pronounce this sentence then
 women may fall when there's no strength in men
romeo thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline
friar laurence for doting not for loving pupil mine
romeo and bad'st me bury love
friar laurence not in a grave
 to lay one in another out to have
romeo i pray thee chide not she whom i love now
 doth grace for grace and love for love allow
 the other did not so
friar laurence o she knew well
 thy love did read by rote and could not spell
 but come young waverer come go with me
 in one respect i'll thy assistant be
 for this alliance may so happy prove
 to turn your households rancour to pure love
romeo o let us hence i stand on sudden haste
friar laurence wisely and slow they stumble that run fast

 enter benvolio and mercutio
mercutio where the devil should this romeo be
 came he not home tonight
benvolio not to his father's i spoke with his man
mercutio ah that same pale hardhearted wench that rosaline
 torments him so that he will sure run mad
benvolio tybalt the kinsman of old capulet
 hath sent a letter to his father's house
mercutio a challenge on my life
benvolio romeo will answer it
mercutio any man that can write may answer a letter
benvolio nay he will answer the letter's master how he
 dares being dared
mercutio alas poor romeo he is already dead stabbed with a
 white wench's black eye shot through the ear with a
 lovesong the very pin of his heart cleft with the
 blind bowboy's buttshaft and is he a man to
 encounter tybalt
benvolio why what is tybalt
mercutio more than prince of cats i can tell you o he is
 the courageous captain of compliments he fights as
 you sing pricksong keeps time distance and
 proportion rests me his minim rest one two and
 the third in your bosom the very butcher of a silk
 button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the
 very first house of the first and second cause
 ah the immortal passado the punto reverso the
 hai
benvolio the what
mercutio the pox of such antic lisping affecting
 fantasticoes these new tuners of accents by jesu
 a very good blade a very tall man a very good
 whore why is not this a lamentable thing
 grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with
 these strange flies these fashionmongers these
 perdonami's who stand so much on the new form
 that they cannot at ease on the old bench o their
 bones their bones
 enter romeo
benvolio here comes romeo here comes romeo
mercutio without his roe like a dried herring flesh flesh

 helen and hero hildings and harlots thisbe a grey
 eye or so but not to the purpose signior
 romeo bon jour there's a french salutation
 to your french slop you gave us the counterfeit
 fairly last night
romeo good morrow to you both what counterfeit did i give you
mercutio the ship sir the slip can you not conceive
romeo pardon good mercutio my business was great and in
 such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
mercutio that's as much as to say such a case as yours
 constrains a man to bow in the hams
romeo meaning to court'sy
mercutio thou hast most kindly hit it
romeo a most courteous exposition
mercutio nay i am the very pink of courtesy
romeo pink for flower
mercutio right
romeo why then is my pump well flowered
mercutio well said follow me this jest now till thou hast
 worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it
 is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular
romeo o singlesoled jest solely singular for the
 singleness
mercutio come between us good benvolio my wits faint
romeo switch and spurs switch and spurs or i'll cry a match
mercutio nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase i have
 done for thou hast more of the wildgoose in one of
 thy wits than i am sure i have in my whole five
 was i with you there for the goose
romeo thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
 not there for the goose
mercutio i will bite thee by the ear for that jest
romeo nay good goose bite not
mercutio thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most
 sharp sauce
romeo and is it not well served in to a sweet goose
mercutio o here's a wit of cheveril that stretches from an
 inch narrow to an ell broad
romeo i stretch it out for that word broad which added
 to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
mercutio why is not this better now than groaning for love
 now art thou sociable now art thou romeo now art
 thou what thou art by art as well as by nature
 for this drivelling love is like a great natural
 that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
benvolio stop there stop there
mercutio thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
benvolio thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
mercutio o thou art deceived i would have made it short
 for i was come to the whole depth of my tale and
 meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer
romeo here's goodly gear

juliet the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse
 in half an hour she promised to return
 perchance she cannot meet him that's not so
 o she is lame love's heralds should be thoughts
 which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
 driving back shadows over louring hills
 therefore do nimblepinion'd doves draw love
 and therefore hath the windswift cupid wings
 now is the sun upon the highmost hill
 of this day's journey and from nine till twelve
 is three long hours yet she is not come
 had she affections and warm youthful blood
 she would be as swift in motion as a ball
 my words would bandy her to my sweet love
 and his to me
 but old folks many feign as they were dead
 unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
 o god she comes
 enter nurse and peter
 o honey nurse what news
 hast thou met with him send thy man away
nurse peter stay at the gate

 let me be satisfied is't good or bad
nurse well you have made a simple choice you know not
 how to choose a man romeo no not he though his

scene vi friar laurence's cell
 enter friar laurence and romeo
friar laurence so smile the heavens upon this holy act
 that after hours with sorrow chide us not
romeo amen amen but come what sorrow can
 it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
 that one short minute gives me in her sight
 do thou but close our hands with holy words
 then lovedevouring death do what he dare
 it is enough i may but call her mine
friar laurence these violent delights have violent ends
 and in their triumph die like fire and powder
 which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
 is loathsome in his own deliciousness
 and in the taste confounds the appetite
 therefore love moderately long love doth so
 too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
 enter juliet
 here comes the lady o so light a foot
 will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint
 a lover may bestride the gossamer
 that idles in the wanton summer air
 and yet not fall so light is vanity
juliet good even to my ghostly confessor
friar laurence romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
juliet as much to him else is his thanks too much
romeo ah juliet if the measure of thy joy
 be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
 to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
 this neighbour air and let rich music's tongue
 unfold the imagined happiness that both
 receive in either by this dear encounter
juliet conceit more rich in matter than in words
 brags of his substance not of ornament
 they are but beggars that can count their worth
 but my true love is grown to such excess
 i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth
friar laurence come come with me and we will make short work
 for by your leaves you shall not stay alone
 till holy church incorporate two in one

 other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what
 eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel

 meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
 an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a
 man for coughing in the street because he hath
 wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
 didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
 his new doublet before easter with another for
 tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou
 wilt tutor me from quarrelling

romeo this gentleman the prince's near ally
 my very friend hath got his mortal hurt
 in my behalf my reputation stain'd
 with tybalt's slandertybalt that an hour
 hath been my kinsman o sweet juliet
 thy beauty hath made me effeminate
 and in my temper soften'd valour's steel
 reenter benvolio
benvolio o romeo romeo brave mercutio's dead
 that gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds
 which too untimely here did scorn the earth
romeo this day's black fate on more days doth depend
 this but begins the woe others must end
benvolio here comes the furious tybalt back again
romeo alive in triumph and mercutio slain
 away to heaven respective lenity
 and fireeyed fury be my conduct now
 reenter tybalt
 now tybalt take the villain back again
 that late thou gavest me for mercutio's soul
 is but a little way above our heads
 staying for thine to keep him company
 either thou or i or both must go with him
tybalt thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
 shalt with him hence
romeo this shall determine that
 they fight tybalt falls
benvolio romeo away be gone
 the citizens are up and tybalt slain
 stand not amazed the prince will doom thee death
 if thou art taken hence be gone away
romeo o i am fortune's fool
benvolio why dost thou stay
 exit romeo
 enter citizens &c
first citizen which way ran he that kill'd mercutio
 tybalt that murderer which way ran he
benvolio there lies that tybalt
first citizen up sir go with me
 i charge thee in the princes name obey
 enter prince attended montague capulet their
 wives and others
prince where are the vile beginners of this fray
benvolio o noble prince i can discover all
 the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
 there lies the man slain by young romeo
 that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio
lady capulet tybalt my cousin o my brother's child
 o prince o cousin husband o the blood is spilt
 o my dear kinsman prince as thou art true
 for blood of ours shed blood of montague
 o cousin cousin
prince benvolio who began this bloody fray
benvolio tybalt here slain whom romeo's hand did slay
 romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
 how nice the quarrel was and urged withal
 your high displeasure all this uttered
 with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow'd
 could not take truce with the unruly spleen
 of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
 with piercing steel at bold mercutio's breast
 who all as hot turns deadly point to point
 and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
 cold death aside and with the other sends
 it back to tybalt whose dexterity
 retorts it romeo he cries aloud
 hold friends friends part and swifter than
 his tongue
 his agile arm beats down their fatal points
 and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
 an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
 of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled
 but by and by comes back to romeo
 who had but newly entertain'd revenge
 and to t they go like lightning for ere i
 could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain
 and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
 this is the truth or let benvolio die
lady capulet he is a kinsman to the montague
 affection makes him false he speaks not true
 some twenty of them fought in this black strife
 and all those twenty could but kill one life
 i beg for justice which thou prince must give
 romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live
prince romeo slew him he slew mercutio
 who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
montague not romeo prince he was mercutio's friend
 his fault concludes but what the law should end
 the life of tybalt
prince and for that offence
 immediately we do exile him hence
 i have an interest in your hate's proceeding
 my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
 but i'll amerce you with so strong a fine
 that you shall all repent the loss of mine
 i will be deaf to pleading and excuses
 nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
 therefore use none let romeo hence in haste
 else when he's found that hour is his last
 bear hence this body and attend our will
 mercy but murders pardoning those that kill

scene ii capulet's orchard
 enter juliet
juliet gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
 towards phoebus lodging such a wagoner
 as phaethon would whip you to the west
 and bring in cloudy night immediately
 spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
 that runaway's eyes may wink and romeo
 leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen
 lovers can see to do their amorous rites
 by their own beauties or if love be blind
 it best agrees with night come civil night
 thou sobersuited matron all in black
 and learn me how to lose a winning match
 play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
 hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks
 with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
 think true love acted simple modesty
 come night come romeo come thou day in night
 for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
 whiter than new snow on a raven's back
 come gentle night come loving blackbrow'd night
 give me my romeo and when he shall die
 take him and cut him out in little stars
 and he will make the face of heaven so fine
 that all the world will be in love with night
 and pay no worship to the garish sun
 o i have bought the mansion of a love
 but not possess'd it and though i am sold
 not yet enjoy'd so tedious is this day
 as is the night before some festival
 to an impatient child that hath new robes
 and may not wear them o here comes my nurse
 and she brings news and every tongue that speaks
 but romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence
 enter nurse with cords
 now nurse what news what hast thou there the cords
 that romeo bid thee fetch
nurse ay ay the cords
 throws them down
juliet ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands
nurse ah welladay he's dead he's dead he's dead
 we are undone lady we are undone
 alack the day he's gone he's kill'd he's dead
juliet can heaven be so envious
nurse romeo can
 though heaven cannot o romeo romeo
 who ever would have thought it romeo
juliet what devil art thou that dost torment me thus
 this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell
 hath romeo slain himself say thou but i'
 and that bare vowel i shall poison more
 than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice
 i am not i if there be such an i
 or those eyes shut that make thee answer i'
 if he be slain say i or if not no
 brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
nurse i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes
 god save the markhere on his manly breast
 a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
 pale pale as ashes all bedaub'd in blood
 all in goreblood i swounded at the sight
juliet o break my heart poor bankrupt break at once
 to prison eyes ne'er look on liberty
 vile earth to earth resign end motion here
 and thou and romeo press one heavy bier
nurse o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
 o courteous tybalt honest gentleman
 that ever i should live to see thee dead
juliet what storm is this that blows so contrary
 is romeo slaughter'd and is tybalt dead
 my dearloved cousin and my dearer lord
 then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
 for who is living if those two are gone
nurse tybalt is gone and romeo banished
 romeo that kill'd him he is banished
juliet o god did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood
nurse it did it did alas the day it did
juliet o serpent heart hid with a flowering face
 did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
 beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
 dovefeather'd raven wolvishravening lamb
 despised substance of divinest show
 just opposite to what thou justly seem'st
 a damned saint an honourable villain
 o nature what hadst thou to do in hell
 when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
 in moral paradise of such sweet flesh
 was ever book containing such vile matter
 so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell
 in such a gorgeous palace
nurse there's no trust
 no faith no honesty in men all perjured
 all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
 ah where's my man give me some aqua vitae
 these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
 shame come to romeo
juliet blister'd be thy tongue
 for such a wish he was not born to shame
 upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
 for tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
 sole monarch of the universal earth
 o what a beast was i to chide at him
nurse will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin
juliet shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
 ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
 when i thy threehours wife have mangled it
 but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
 that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband
 back foolish tears back to your native spring
 your tributary drops belong to woe
 which you mistaking offer up to joy
 my husband lives that tybalt would have slain
 and tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband
 all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
 some word there was worser than tybalt's death
 that murder'd me i would forget it fain
 but o it presses to my memory
 like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
 tybalt is dead and romeobanished'
 that banished that one word banished'
 hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt's death
 was woe enough if it had ended there
 or if sour woe delights in fellowship
 and needly will be rank'd with other griefs
 why follow'd not when she said tybalt's dead'
 thy father or thy mother nay or both
 which modern lamentations might have moved
 but with a rearward following tybalt's death
 romeo is banished to speak that word
 is father mother tybalt romeo juliet
 all slain all dead romeo is banished'
 there is no end no limit measure bound
 in that word's death no words can that woe sound
 where is my father and my mother nurse
nurse weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse
 will you go to them i will bring you thither
juliet wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent
 when theirs are dry for romeo's banishment
 take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled
 both you and i for romeo is exiled
 he made you for a highway to my bed
 but i a maid die maidenwidowed
 come cords come nurse i'll to my weddingbed
 and death not romeo take my maidenhead
nurse hie to your chamber i'll find romeo
 to comfort you i wot well where he is
 hark ye your romeo will be here at night
 i'll to him he is hid at laurence cell

 affliction is enamour'd of thy parts
 and thou art wedded to calamity
 enter romeo
romeo father what news what is the prince's doom
 what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
 that i yet know not
friar laurence too familiar
 is my dear son with such sour company
 i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom
romeo what less than doomsday is the prince's doom
friar laurence a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips
 not body's death but body's banishment
romeo ha banishment be merciful say death'
 for exile hath more terror in his look
 much more than death do not say banishment'
friar laurence hence from verona art thou banished
 be patient for the world is broad and wide
romeo there is no world without verona walls
 but purgatory torture hell itself
 hencebanished is banish'd from the world
 and world's exile is death then banished
 is death misterm'd calling death banishment
 thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe
 and smilest upon the stroke that murders me
friar laurence o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness
 thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
 taking thy part hath rush'd aside the law
 and turn'd that black word death to banishment
 this is dear mercy and thou seest it not
romeo tis torture and not mercy heaven is here
 where juliet lives and every cat and dog
 and little mouse every unworthy thing
 live here in heaven and may look on her
 but romeo may not more validity
 more honourable state more courtship lives
 in carrionflies than romeo they my seize
 on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand
 and steal immortal blessing from her lips
 who even in pure and vestal modesty
 still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
 but romeo may not he is banished
 flies may do this but i from this must fly
 they are free men but i am banished
 and say'st thou yet that exile is not death
 hadst thou no poison mix'd no sharpground knife
 no sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean
 but banished to kill me'banished'
 o friar the damned use that word in hell
 howlings attend it how hast thou the heart
 being a divine a ghostly confessor
 a sinabsolver and my friend profess'd
 to mangle me with that word banished'
friar laurence thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word
romeo o thou wilt speak again of banishment
friar laurence i'll give thee armour to keep off that word
 adversity's sweet milk philosophy
 to comfort thee though thou art banished
romeo yet banished hang up philosophy
 unless philosophy can make a juliet
 displant a town reverse a prince's doom
 it helps not it prevails not talk no more
friar laurence o then i see that madmen have no ears
romeo how should they when that wise men have no eyes
friar laurence let me dispute with thee of thy estate
romeo thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
 wert thou as young as i juliet thy love
 an hour but married tybalt murdered
 doting like me and like me banished
 then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
 and fall upon the ground as i do now
 taking the measure of an unmade grave
 knocking within
friar laurence arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself
romeo not i unless the breath of heartsick groans
 mistlike infold me from the search of eyes
 knocking
friar laurence hark how they knock who's there romeo arise
 thou wilt be taken stay awhile stand up
 knocking
 run to my study by and by god's will
 what simpleness is this i come i come
 knocking
 who knocks so hard whence come you what's your will
nurse within let me come in and you shall know
 my errand
 i come from lady juliet
friar laurence welcome then
 enter nurse
nurse o holy friar o tell me holy friar
 where is my lady's lord where's romeo
friar laurence there on the ground with his own tears made drunk
nurse o he is even in my mistress case
 just in her case o woful sympathy
 piteous predicament even so lies she
 blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
 stand up stand up stand and you be a man
 for juliet's sake for her sake rise and stand
 why should you fall into so deep an o
romeo nurse
nurse ah sir ah sir well death's the end of all
romeo spakest thou of juliet how is it with her
 doth she not think me an old murderer
 now i have stain'd the childhood of our joy
 with blood removed but little from her own
 where is she and how doth she and what says
 my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love
nurse o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
 and now falls on her bed and then starts up
 and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries
 and then down falls again
romeo as if that name
 shot from the deadly level of a gun
 did murder her as that name's cursed hand
 murder'd her kinsman o tell me friar tell me
 in what vile part of this anatomy
 doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack
 the hateful mansion
 drawing his sword
friar laurence hold thy desperate hand
 art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
 thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
 the unreasonable fury of a beast
 unseemly woman in a seeming man
 or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
 thou hast amazed me by my holy order
 i thought thy disposition better temper'd
 hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
 and stay thy lady too that lives in thee
 by doing damned hate upon thyself
 why rail'st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
 since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
 in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
 fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
 which like a usurer abound'st in all
 and usest none in that true use indeed
 which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
 thy noble shape is but a form of wax
 digressing from the valour of a man
 thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
 killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish
 thy wit that ornament to shape and love
 misshapen in the conduct of them both
 like powder in a skitless soldier's flask
 is set afire by thine own ignorance
 and thou dismember'd with thine own defence
 what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive
 for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
 there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee
 but thou slew'st tybalt there are thou happy too
 the law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
 and turns it to exile there art thou happy
 a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back
 happiness courts thee in her best array
 but like a misbehaved and sullen wench
 thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love
 take heed take heed for such die miserable
 go get thee to thy love as was decreed
 ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
 but look thou stay not till the watch be set
 for then thou canst not pass to mantua
 where thou shalt live till we can find a time
 to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
 beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
 with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
 than thou went'st forth in lamentation
 go before nurse commend me to thy lady
 and bid her hasten all the house to bed
 which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
 romeo is coming
nurse o lord i could have stay'd here all the night
 to hear good counsel o what learning is
 my lord i'll tell my lady you will come
romeo do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
nurse here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
 hie you make haste for it grows very late
 exit
romeo how well my comfort is revived by this
friar laurence go hence good night and here stands all your state
 either be gone before the watch be set
 or by the break of day disguised from hence
 sojourn in mantua i'll find out your man
 and he shall signify from time to time
 every good hap to you that chances here
 give me thy hand tis late farewell good night
romeo but that a joy past joy calls out on me
 it were a grief so brief to part with thee farewell

 romeo and juliet
act iii
scene v capulet's orchard
 enter romeo and juliet above at the window
juliet wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
 it was the nightingale and not the lark
 that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
 nightly she sings on yon pomegranatetree
 believe me love it was the nightingale
romeo it was the lark the herald of the morn
 no nightingale look love what envious streaks
 do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
 night's candles are burnt out and jocund day
 stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
 i must be gone and live or stay and die
juliet yon light is not daylight i know it i
 it is some meteor that the sun exhales
 to be to thee this night a torchbearer
 and light thee on thy way to mantua
 therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone
romeo let me be ta'en let me be put to death
 i am content so thou wilt have it so
 i'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye
 tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow
 nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
 the vaulty heaven so high above our heads
 i have more care to stay than will to go
 come death and welcome juliet wills it so
 how is't my soul let's talk it is not day
juliet it is it is hie hence be gone away
 it is the lark that sings so out of tune
 straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
 some say the lark makes sweet division
 this doth not so for she divideth us
 some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
 o now i would they had changed voices too
 since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
 hunting thee hence with hunt'sup to the day
 o now be gone more light and light it grows
romeo more light and light more dark and dark our woes
 enter nurse to the chamber
nurse madam
juliet nurse
nurse your lady mother is coming to your chamber
 the day is broke be wary look about
 exit
juliet then window let day in and let life out
romeo farewell farewell one kiss and i'll descend
 he goeth down
juliet art thou gone so love lord ay husband friend
 i must hear from thee every day in the hour
 for in a minute there are many days
 o by this count i shall be much in years
 ere i again behold my romeo
romeo farewell
 i will omit no opportunity
 that may convey my greetings love to thee
juliet o think'st thou we shall ever meet again
romeo i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
 for sweet discourses in our time to come
juliet o god i have an illdivining soul
 methinks i see thee now thou art below
 as one dead in the bottom of a tomb
 either my eyesight fails or thou look'st pale
romeo and trust me love in my eye so do you
 dry sorrow drinks our blood adieu adieu
 exit
juliet o fortune fortune all men call thee fickle
 if thou art fickle what dost thou with him
 that is renown'd for faith be fickle fortune
 for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long
 but send him back
lady capulet within ho daughter are you up
juliet who is't that calls is it my lady mother
 is she not down so late or up so early
 what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither
 enter lady capulet
lady capulet why how now juliet
juliet madam i am not well
lady capulet evermore weeping for your cousin's death
 what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
 an if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
 therefore have done some grief shows much of love
 but much of grief shows still some want of wit
juliet yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
lady capulet so shall you feel the loss but not the friend
 which you weep for
juliet feeling so the loss
 cannot choose but ever weep the friend
lady capulet well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death
 as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him
juliet what villain madam
lady capulet that same villain romeo
juliet aside villain and he be many miles asunder
 god pardon him i do with all my heart
 and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
lady capulet that is because the traitor murderer lives
juliet ay madam from the reach of these my hands
 would none but i might venge my cousin's death
lady capulet we will have vengeance for it fear thou not
 then weep no more i'll send to one in mantua
 where that same banish'd runagate doth live
 shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
 that he shall soon keep tybalt company
 and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied
juliet indeed i never shall be satisfied
 with romeo till i behold himdead
 is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd
 madam if you could find out but a man
 to bear a poison i would temper it
 that romeo should upon receipt thereof
 soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors
 to hear him named and cannot come to him
 to wreak the love i bore my cousin
 upon his body that slaughter'd him
lady capulet find thou the means and i'll find such a man
 but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings girl
juliet and joy comes well in such a needy time
 what are they i beseech your ladyship
lady capulet well well thou hast a careful father child
 one who to put thee from thy heaviness
 hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
 that thou expect'st not nor i look'd not for
juliet madam in happy time what day is that
lady capulet marry my child early next thursday morn
 the gallant young and noble gentleman
 the county paris at saint peter's church
 shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
juliet now by saint peter's church and peter too
 he shall not make me there a joyful bride
 i wonder at this haste that i must wed
 ere he that should be husband comes to woo
 i pray you tell my lord and father madam
 i will not marry yet and when i do i swear
 it shall be romeo whom you know i hate
 rather than paris these are news indeed
lady capulet here comes your father tell him so yourself
 and see how he will take it at your hands
 enter capulet and nurse
capulet when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
 but for the sunset of my brother's son
 it rains downright
 how now a conduit girl what still in tears
 evermore showering in one little body
 thou counterfeit'st a bark a sea a wind
 for still thy eyes which i may call the sea
 do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
 sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
 who raging with thy tears and they with them
 without a sudden calm will overset
 thy tempesttossed body how now wife
 have you deliver'd to her our decree
lady capulet ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
 i would the fool were married to her grave
capulet soft take me with you take me with you wife
 how will she none doth she not give us thanks
 is she not proud doth she not count her blest
 unworthy as she is that we have wrought
 so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
juliet not proud you have but thankful that you have
 proud can i never be of what i hate
 but thankful even for hate that is meant love
capulet how now how now choplogic what is this
 proud and i thank you and i thank you not'
 and yet not proud mistress minion you
 thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
 but fettle your fine joints gainst thursday next
 to go with paris to saint peter's church
 or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither
 out you greensickness carrion out you baggage
 you tallowface
lady capulet fie fie what are you mad
juliet good father i beseech you on my knees
 hear me with patience but to speak a word
capulet hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
 i tell thee what get thee to church o thursday
 or never after look me in the face
 speak not reply not do not answer me
 my fingers itch wife we scarce thought us blest
 that god had lent us but this only child
 but now i see this one is one too much
 and that we have a curse in having her
 out on her hilding
nurse god in heaven bless her
 you are to blame my lord to rate her so
capulet and why my lady wisdom hold your tongue
 good prudence smatter with your gossips go
nurse i speak no treason
capulet o god ye godden
nurse may not one speak
capulet peace you mumbling fool
 utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl
 for here we need it not
lady capulet you are too hot
capulet god's bread it makes me mad
 day night hour tide time work play
 alone in company still my care hath been
 to have her match'd and having now provided
 a gentleman of noble parentage
 of fair demesnes youthful and nobly train'd
 stuff'd as they say with honourable parts
 proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man
 and then to have a wretched puling fool
 a whining mammet in her fortune's tender
 to answer i'll not wed i cannot love
 i am too young i pray you pardon me'
 but as you will not wed i'll pardon you
 graze where you will you shall not house with me
 look to't think on't i do not use to jest
 thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
 an you be mine i'll give you to my friend
 and you be not hang beg starve die in
 the streets
 for by my soul i'll ne'er acknowledge thee
 nor what is mine shall never do thee good
 trust to't bethink you i'll not be forsworn
 exit
juliet is there no pity sitting in the clouds
 that sees into the bottom of my grief
 o sweet my mother cast me not away
 delay this marriage for a month a week
 or if you do not make the bridal bed
 in that dim monument where tybalt lies
lady capulet talk not to me for i'll not speak a word
 do as thou wilt for i have done with thee
 exit
juliet o godo nurse how shall this be prevented
 my husband is on earth my faith in heaven
 how shall that faith return again to earth
 unless that husband send it me from heaven
 by leaving earth comfort me counsel me
 alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
 upon so soft a subject as myself
 what say'st thou hast thou not a word of joy
 some comfort nurse
nurse faith here it is
 romeo is banish'd and all the world to nothing
 that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you
 or if he do it needs must be by stealth
 then since the case so stands as now it doth
 i think it best you married with the county
 o he's a lovely gentleman
 romeo's a dishclout to him an eagle madam
 hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
 as paris hath beshrew my very heart
 i think you are happy in this second match
 for it excels your first or if it did not
 your first is dead or twere as good he were
 as living here and you no use of him
juliet speakest thou from thy heart
nurse and from my soul too
 or else beshrew them both
juliet amen
nurse what
juliet well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
 go in and tell my lady i am gone
 having displeased my father to laurence cell
 to make confession and to be absolved
nurse marry i will and this is wisely done
 exit
juliet ancient damnation o most wicked fiend
 is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
 or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
 which she hath praised him with above compare
 so many thousand times go counsellor
 thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
 i'll to the friar to know his remedy
 if all else fail myself have power to die
 exit
 romeo and juliet
act iv
scene i friar laurence's cell
 enter friar laurence and paris
friar laurence on thursday sir the time is very short
paris my father capulet will have it so
 and i am nothing slow to slack his haste
friar laurence you say you do not know the lady's mind
 uneven is the course i like it not
paris immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death
 and therefore have i little talk'd of love
 for venus smiles not in a house of tears
 now sir her father counts it dangerous
 that she doth give her sorrow so much sway
 and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
 to stop the inundation of her tears
 which too much minded by herself alone
 may be put from her by society
 now do you know the reason of this haste
friar laurence aside i would i knew not why it should be slow'd
 look sir here comes the lady towards my cell
 enter juliet
paris happily met my lady and my wife
juliet that may be sir when i may be a wife
paris that may be must be love on thursday next
juliet what must be shall be
friar laurence that's a certain text
paris come you to make confession to this father
juliet to answer that i should confess to you
paris do not deny to him that you love me
juliet i will confess to you that i love him
paris so will ye i am sure that you love me
juliet if i do so it will be of more price
 being spoke behind your back than to your face
paris poor soul thy face is much abused with tears
juliet the tears have got small victory by that
 for it was bad enough before their spite
paris thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report
juliet that is no slander sir which is a truth
 and what i spake i spake it to my face
paris thy face is mine and thou hast slander'd it
juliet it may be so for it is not mine own
 are you at leisure holy father now
 or shall i come to you at evening mass
friar laurence my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
 my lord we must entreat the time alone
paris god shield i should disturb devotion
 juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye
 till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
 exit
juliet o shut the door and when thou hast done so
 come weep with me past hope past cure past help
friar laurence ah juliet i already know thy grief
 it strains me past the compass of my wits
 i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
 on thursday next be married to this county
juliet tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this
 unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
 if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
 do thou but call my resolution wise
 and with this knife i'll help it presently
 god join'd my heart and romeo's thou our hands
 and ere this hand by thee to romeo seal'd
 shall be the label to another deed
 or my true heart with treacherous revolt
 turn to another this shall slay them both
 therefore out of thy longexperienced time
 give me some present counsel or behold
 twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
 shall play the umpire arbitrating that
 which the commission of thy years and art
 could to no issue of true honour bring
 be not so long to speak i long to die
 if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy
friar laurence hold daughter i do spy a kind of hope
 which craves as desperate an execution
 as that is desperate which we would prevent
 if rather than to marry county paris
 thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
 then is it likely thou wilt undertake
 a thing like death to chide away this shame
 that copest with death himself to scape from it
 and if thou darest i'll give thee remedy
juliet o bid me leap rather than marry paris
 from off the battlements of yonder tower
 or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
 where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
 or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse
 o'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones
 with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
 or bid me go into a newmade grave
 and hide me with a dead man in his shroud
 things that to hear them told have made me tremble
 and i will do it without fear or doubt
 to live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love
friar laurence hold then go home be merry give consent
 to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow
 tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
 let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
 take thou this vial being then in bed
 and this distilled liquor drink thou off
 when presently through all thy veins shall run
 a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
 shall keep his native progress but surcease
 no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
 the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
 to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
 like death when he shuts up the day of life
 each part deprived of supple government
 shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
 and in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
 thou shalt continue two and forty hours
 and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
 now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
 to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
 then as the manner of our country is
 in thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
 thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
 where all the kindred of the capulets lie
 in the mean time against thou shalt awake
 shall romeo by my letters know our drift
 and hither shall he come and he and i
 will watch thy waking and that very night
 shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
 and this shall free thee from this present shame
 if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
 abate thy valour in the acting it
juliet give me give me o tell not me of fear
friar laurence hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
 in this resolve i'll send a friar with speed
 to mantua with my letters to thy lord
juliet love give me strength and strength shall help afford
 farewell dear father

 enter lady capulet
lady capulet what are you busy ho need you my help
juliet no madam we have cull'd such necessaries
 as are behoveful for our state tomorrow

 exeunt lady capulet and nurse
juliet farewell god knows when we shall meet again
 i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
 that almost freezes up the heat of life
 i'll call them back again to comfort me
 nurse what should she do here
 my dismal scene i needs must act alone
 come vial
 what if this mixture do not work at all
 shall i be married then tomorrow morning
 no no this shall forbid it lie thou there
 laying down her dagger
 what if it be a poison which the friar
 subtly hath minister'd to have me dead
 lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
 because he married me before to romeo
 i fear it is and yet methinks it should not
 for he hath still been tried a holy man
 how if when i am laid into the tomb
 i wake before the time that romeo
 come to redeem me there's a fearful point
 shall i not then be stifled in the vault
 to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
 and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
 or if i live is it not very like
 the horrible conceit of death and night
 together with the terror of the place
 as in a vault an ancient receptacle
 where for these many hundred years the bones
 of all my buried ancestors are packed
 where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth
 lies festering in his shroud where as they say
 at some hours in the night spirits resort
 alack alack is it not like that i
 so early waking what with loathsome smells
 and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
 that living mortals hearing them run mad
 o if i wake shall i not be distraught
 environed with all these hideous fears
 and madly play with my forefather's joints
 and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
 and in this rage with some great kinsman's bone
 as with a club dash out my desperate brains
 o look methinks i see my cousin's ghost
 seeking out romeo that did spit his body
 upon a rapier's point stay tybalt stay
 romeo i come this do i drink to thee

 most lamentable day most woful day

 in these confusions heaven and yourself
 had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
 and all the better is it for the maid
 your part in her you could not keep from death
 but heaven keeps his part in eternal life
 the most you sought was her promotion
 for twas your heaven she should be advanced
 and weep ye now seeing she is advanced
 above the clouds as high as heaven itself
 o in this love you love your child so ill
 that you run mad seeing that she is well
 she's not well married that lives married long
 but she's best married that dies married young
 dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
 on this fair corse and as the custom is
 in all her best array bear her to church
 for though fond nature bids us an lament
 yet nature's tears are reason's merriment
capulet all things that we ordained festival
 turn from their office to black funeral
 our instruments to melancholy bells
 our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
 our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
 our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
 and all things change them to the contrary

 romeo and juliet
act v
scene i mantua a street
 enter romeo
romeo if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep
 my dreams presage some joyful news at hand
 my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne
 and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
 lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
 i dreamt my lady came and found me dead
 strange dream that gives a dead man leave
 to think
 and breathed such life with kisses in my lips
 that i revived and was an emperor
 ah me how sweet is love itself possess'd
 when but love's shadows are so rich in joy
 enter balthasar booted
 news from veronahow now balthasar
 dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
 how doth my lady is my father well
 how fares my juliet that i ask again
 for nothing can be ill if she be well
balthasar then she is well and nothing can be ill
 her body sleeps in capel's monument
 and her immortal part with angels lives
 i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
 and presently took post to tell it you
 o pardon me for bringing these ill news
 since you did leave it for my office sir
romeo is it even so then i defy you stars
 thou know'st my lodging get me ink and paper
 and hire posthorses i will hence tonight
balthasar i do beseech you sir have patience
 your looks are pale and wild and do import
 some misadventure
romeo tush thou art deceived
 leave me and do the thing i bid thee do
 hast thou no letters to me from the friar
balthasar no my good lord
romeo no matter get thee gone
 and hire those horses i'll be with thee straight
 exit balthasar
 well juliet i will lie with thee tonight
 let's see for means o mischief thou art swift
 to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
 i do remember an apothecary
 and hereabouts he dwellswhich late i noted
 in tatter'd weeds with overwhelming brows
 culling of simples meagre were his looks
 sharp misery had worn him to the bones
 and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
 an alligator stuff'd and other skins
 of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
 a beggarly account of empty boxes
 green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
 remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
 were thinly scatter'd to make up a show
 noting this penury to myself i said
 an if a man did need a poison now
 whose sale is present death in mantua
 here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him'
 o this same thought did but forerun my need
 and this same needy man must sell it me
 as i remember this should be the house
 being holiday the beggar's shop is shut
 what ho apothecary
 enter apothecary
apothecary who calls so loud
romeo come hither man i see that thou art poor
 hold there is forty ducats let me have
 a dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
 as will disperse itself through all the veins
 that the lifeweary taker may fall dead
 and that the trunk may be discharged of breath
 as violently as hasty powder fired
 doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb
apothecary such mortal drugs i have but mantua's law
 is death to any he that utters them
romeo art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
 and fear'st to die famine is in thy cheeks
 need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
 contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
 the world is not thy friend nor the world's law
 the world affords no law to make thee rich
 then be not poor but break it and take this
apothecary my poverty but not my will consents
romeo i pay thy poverty and not thy will
apothecary put this in any liquid thing you will
 and drink it off and if you had the strength
 of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
romeo there is thy gold worse poison to men's souls
 doing more murders in this loathsome world
 than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
 i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
 farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
 come cordial and not poison go with me
 to juliet's grave for there must i use thee

scene ii friar laurence's cell
 enter friar john
friar john holy franciscan friar brother ho
 enter friar laurence
friar laurence this same should be the voice of friar john
 welcome from mantua what says romeo
 or if his mind be writ give me his letter
friar john going to find a barefoot brother out
 one of our order to associate me
 here in this city visiting the sick
 and finding him the searchers of the town
 suspecting that we both were in a house
 where the infectious pestilence did reign
 seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth
 so that my speed to mantua there was stay'd
friar laurence who bare my letter then to romeo
friar john i could not send ithere it is again
 nor get a messenger to bring it thee
 so fearful were they of infection
friar laurence unhappy fortune by my brotherhood
 the letter was not nice but full of charge
 of dear import and the neglecting it
 may do much danger friar john go hence
 get me an iron crow and bring it straight
 unto my cell
friar john brother i'll go and bring it thee
 exit
friar laurence now must i to the monument alone
 within three hours will fair juliet wake
 she will beshrew me much that romeo
 hath had no notice of these accidents
 but i will write again to mantua
 and keep her at my cell till romeo come
 poor living corse closed in a dead man's tomb
 exit
 romeo and juliet
act v
scene iii a churchyard in it a tomb belonging to the capulets
 enter paris and his page bearing flowers and a torch
paris give me thy torch boy hence and stand aloof
 yet put it out for i would not be seen
 under yond yewtrees lay thee all along
 holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
 so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
 being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
 but thou shalt hear it whistle then to me
 as signal that thou hear'st something approach
 give me those flowers do as i bid thee go
page aside i am almost afraid to stand alone
 here in the churchyard yet i will adventure
 retires
paris sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed i strew
 o woe thy canopy is dust and stones
 which with sweet water nightly i will dew
 or wanting that with tears distill'd by moans
 the obsequies that i for thee will keep
 nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
 the page whistles
 the boy gives warning something doth approach
 what cursed foot wanders this way tonight
 to cross my obsequies and true love's rite
 what with a torch muffle me night awhile
 retires
 enter romeo and balthasar with a torch
 mattock &c
romeo give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
 hold take this letter early in the morning
 see thou deliver it to my lord and father
 give me the light upon thy life i charge thee
 whate'er thou hear'st or seest stand all aloof
 and do not interrupt me in my course
 why i descend into this bed of death
 is partly to behold my lady's face
 but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
 a precious ring a ring that i must use
 in dear employment therefore hence be gone
 but if thou jealous dost return to pry
 in what i further shall intend to do
 by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint
 and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
 the time and my intents are savagewild
 more fierce and more inexorable far
 than empty tigers or the roaring sea
balthasar i will be gone sir and not trouble you
romeo so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that
 live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
balthasar aside for all this same i'll hide me hereabout
 his looks i fear and his intents i doubt
 retires
romeo thou detestable maw thou womb of death
 gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth
 thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open
 and in despite i'll cram thee with more food
 opens the tomb
paris this is that banish'd haughty montague
 that murder'd my love's cousin with which grief
 it is supposed the fair creature died
 and here is come to do some villanous shame
 to the dead bodies i will apprehend him
 comes forward
 stop thy unhallow'd toil vile montague
 can vengeance be pursued further than death
 condemned villain i do apprehend thee
 obey and go with me for thou must die
romeo i must indeed and therefore came i hither
 good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
 fly hence and leave me think upon these gone
 let them affright thee i beseech thee youth
 put not another sin upon my head
 by urging me to fury o be gone
 by heaven i love thee better than myself
 for i come hither arm'd against myself
 stay not be gone live and hereafter say
 a madman's mercy bade thee run away
paris i do defy thy conjurations
 and apprehend thee for a felon here
romeo wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy
 they fight
page o lord they fight i will go call the watch
 exit
paris o i am slain
 falls
 if thou be merciful
 open the tomb lay me with juliet
 dies
romeo in faith i will let me peruse this face
 mercutio's kinsman noble county paris
 what said my man when my betossed soul
 did not attend him as we rode i think
 he told me paris should have married juliet
 said he not so or did i dream it so
 or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet
 to think it was so o give me thy hand
 one writ with me in sour misfortune's book
 i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave
 a grave o no a lantern slaughter'd youth
 for here lies juliet and her beauty makes
 this vault a feasting presence full of light
 death lie thou there by a dead man interr'd
 laying paris in the tomb
 how oft when men are at the point of death
 have they been merry which their keepers call
 a lightning before death o how may i
 call this a lightning o my love my wife
 death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath
 hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
 thou art not conquer'd beauty's ensign yet
 is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
 and death's pale flag is not advanced there
 tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
 o what more favour can i do to thee
 than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
 to sunder his that was thine enemy
 forgive me cousin ah dear juliet
 why art thou yet so fair shall i believe
 that unsubstantial death is amorous
 and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
 thee here in dark to be his paramour
 for fear of that i still will stay with thee
 and never from this palace of dim night
 depart again here here will i remain
 with worms that are thy chambermaids o here
 will i set up my everlasting rest
 and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
 from this worldwearied flesh eyes look your last
 arms take your last embrace and lips o you
 the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
 a dateless bargain to engrossing death
 come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
 thou desperate pilot now at once run on
 the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
 here's to my love
 drinks
 o true apothecary
 thy drugs are quick thus with a kiss i die
 dies
 enter at the other end of the churchyard friar
 laurence with a lantern crow and spade
friar laurence saint francis be my speed how oft tonight
 have my old feet stumbled at graves who's there
balthasar here's one a friend and one that knows you well
friar laurence bliss be upon you tell me good my friend

friar laurence who is it
balthasar romeo
friar laurence how long hath he been there
balthasar full half an hour
friar laurence go with me to the vault
balthasar i dare not sir
 my master knows not but i am gone hence
 and fearfully did menace me with death
 if i did stay to look on his intents
friar laurence stay then i'll go alone fear comes upon me
 o much i fear some ill unlucky thing
balthasar as i did sleep under this yewtree here
 i dreamt my master and another fought
 and that my master slew him
friar laurence romeo
 advances
 alack alack what blood is this which stains
 the stony entrance of this sepulchre
 what mean these masterless and gory swords
 to lie discolour'd by this place of peace
 enters the tomb
 romeo o pale who else what paris too
 and steep'd in blood ah what an unkind hour
 is guilty of this lamentable chance
 the lady stirs
 juliet wakes
juliet o comfortable friar where is my lord
 i do remember well where i should be
 and there i am where is my romeo
 noise within
friar laurence i hear some noise lady come from that nest
 of death contagion and unnatural sleep
 a greater power than we can contradict
 hath thwarted our intents come come away

 and paris too come i'll dispose of thee
 among a sisterhood of holy nuns
 stay not to question for the watch is coming
 come go good juliet
 noise again

 exit friar laurence
 what's here a cup closed in my true love's hand
 poison i see hath been his timeless end

 to help me after i will kiss thy lips
 haply some poison yet doth hang on them
 to make die with a restorative
 kisses him
 thy lips are warm
first watchman within lead boy which way
juliet yea noise then i'll be brief o happy dagger
 snatching romeo's dagger
 this is thy sheath
 stabs herself
 there rust and let me die
 falls on romeo's body and dies
 enter watch with the page of paris
page this is the place there where the torch doth burn
first watchman the ground is bloody search about the churchyard
 go some of you whoe'er you find attach
 pitiful sight here lies the county slain
 and juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
 who here hath lain these two days buried
 go tell the prince run to the capulets
 raise up the montagues some others search
 we see the ground whereon these woes do lie
 but the true ground of all these piteous woes
 we cannot without circumstance descry
 reenter some of the watch with balthasar
second watchman here's romeo's man we found him in the churchyard
first watchman hold him in safety till the prince come hither
 reenter others of the watch with friar laurence
third watchman here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
 we took this mattock and this spade from him
 as he was coming from this churchyard side
first watchman a great suspicion stay the friar too
 enter the prince and attendants
prince what misadventure is so early up
 that calls our person from our morning's rest
 enter capulet lady capulet and others
capulet what should it be that they so shriek abroad
lady capulet the people in the street cry romeo
 some juliet and some paris and all run
 with open outcry toward our monument
prince what fear is this which startles in our ears
first watchman sovereign here lies the county paris slain
 and romeo dead and juliet dead before
 warm and new kill'd
prince search seek and know how this foul murder comes
first watchman here is a friar and slaughter'd romeo's man
 with instruments upon them fit to open
 these dead men's tombs
capulet o heavens o wife look how our daughter bleeds
 this dagger hath mista'enfor lo his house
 is empty on the back of montague
 and it missheathed in my daughter's bosom
lady capulet o me this sight of death is as a bell
 that warns my old age to a sepulchre
 enter montague and others
prince come montague for thou art early up
 to see thy son and heir more early down
montague alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
 grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath
 what further woe conspires against mine age
prince look and thou shalt see
montague o thou untaught what manners is in this
 to press before thy father to a grave
prince seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
 till we can clear these ambiguities
 and know their spring their head their
 true descent
 and then will i be general of your woes
 and lead you even to death meantime forbear
 and let mischance be slave to patience
 bring forth the parties of suspicion
friar laurence i am the greatest able to do least
 yet most suspected as the time and place
 doth make against me of this direful murder
 and here i stand both to impeach and purge
 myself condemned and myself excused
prince then say at once what thou dost know in this
friar laurence i will be brief for my short date of breath
 is not so long as is a tedious tale
 romeo there dead was husband to that juliet
 and she there dead that romeo's faithful wife
 i married them and their stol'n marriageday
 was tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death
 banish'd the newmade bridegroom from the city
 for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined
 you to remove that siege of grief from her
 betroth'd and would have married her perforce
 to county paris then comes she to me
 and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
 to rid her from this second marriage
 or in my cell there would she kill herself
 then gave i her so tutor'd by my art
 a sleeping potion which so took effect
 as i intended for it wrought on her
 the form of death meantime i writ to romeo
 that he should hither come as this dire night
 to help to take her from her borrow'd grave
 being the time the potion's force should cease
 but he which bore my letter friar john
 was stay'd by accident and yesternight
 return'd my letter back then all alone
 at the prefixed hour of her waking
 came i to take her from her kindred's vault
 meaning to keep her closely at my cell
 till i conveniently could send to romeo
 but when i came some minute ere the time
 of her awaking here untimely lay
 the noble paris and true romeo dead
 she wakes and i entreated her come forth
 and bear this work of heaven with patience
 but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
 and she too desperate would not go with me
 but as it seems did violence on herself
 all this i know and to the marriage
 her nurse is privy and if aught in this
 miscarried by my fault let my old life
 be sacrificed some hour before his time
 unto the rigour of severest law
prince we still have known thee for a holy man
 where's romeo's man what can he say in this
balthasar i brought my master news of juliet's death
 and then in post he came from mantua
 to this same place to this same monument
 this letter he early bid me give his father
 and threatened me with death going in the vault
 i departed not and left him there
prince give me the letter i will look on it
 where is the county's page that raised the watch
 sirrah what made your master in this place
page he came with flowers to strew his lady's grave
 and bid me stand aloof and so i did
 anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
 and by and by my master drew on him
 and then i ran away to call the watch
prince this letter doth make good the friar's words
 their course of love the tidings of her death
 and here he writes that he did buy a poison
 of a poor pothecary and therewithal
 came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
 where be these enemies capulet montague
 see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
 that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
 and i for winking at your discords too
 have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish'd
capulet o brother montague give me thy hand
 this is my daughter's jointure for no more
 can i demand
montague but i can give thee more
 for i will raise her statue in pure gold
 that while verona by that name is known
 there shall no figure at such rate be set
 as that of true and faithful juliet
capulet as rich shall romeo's by his lady's lie
 poor sacrifices of our enmity
prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings
 the sun for sorrow will not show his head
 go hence to have more talk of these sad things
 some shall be pardon'd and some punished
 for never was a story of more woe
 than this of juliet and her romeo

 enter poet painter jeweller merchant and
 others at several doors
poet good day sir
painter i am glad you're well
poet i have not seen you long how goes the world
painter it wears sir as it grows
poet ay that's well known
 but what particular rarity what strange
 which manifold record not matches see
 magic of bounty all these spirits thy power
 hath conjured to attend i know the merchant
painter i know them both th other's a jeweller
merchant o tis a worthy lord
jeweller nay that's most fix'd
merchant a most incomparable man breathed as it were
 to an untirable and continuate goodness
 he passes
jeweller i have a jewel here
merchant o pray let's see't for the lord timon sir
jeweller if he will touch the estimate but for that
poet reciting to himself when we for recompense have
 praised the vile
 it stains the glory in that happy verse
 which aptly sings the good'
merchant tis a good form
 looking at the jewel
jeweller and rich here is a water look ye
painter you are rapt sir in some work some dedication
 to the great lord
poet a thing slipp'd idly from me
 our poesy is as a gum which oozes
 from whence tis nourish'd the fire i the flint
 shows not till it be struck our gentle flame
 provokes itself and like the current flies
 each bound it chafes what have you there
painter a picture sir when comes your book forth
poet upon the heels of my presentment sir
 let's see your piece
painter tis a good piece
poet so tis this comes off well and excellent
painter indifferent
poet admirable how this grace
 speaks his own standing what a mental power
 this eye shoots forth how big imagination
 moves in this lip to the dumbness of the gesture
 one might interpret
painter it is a pretty mocking of the life
 here is a touch is't good
poet i will say of it
 it tutors nature artificial strife
 lives in these touches livelier than life
 enter certain senators and pass over
painter how this lord is follow'd
poet the senators of athens happy man
painter look more
poet you see this confluence this great flood
 of visitors
 i have in this rough work shaped out a man
 whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
 with amplest entertainment my free drift
 halts not particularly but moves itself
 in a wide sea of wax no levell'd malice
 infects one comma in the course i hold
 but flies an eagle flight bold and forth on
 leaving no tract behind
painter how shall i understand you
poet i will unbolt to you
 you see how all conditions how all minds
 as well of glib and slippery creatures as
 of grave and austere quality tender down
 their services to lord timon his large fortune
 upon his good and gracious nature hanging
 subdues and properties to his love and tendance
 all sorts of hearts yea from the glassfaced flatterer
 to apemantus that few things loves better
 than to abhor himself even he drops down
 the knee before him and returns in peace
 most rich in timon's nod
painter i saw them speak together
poet sir i have upon a high and pleasant hill
 feign'd fortune to be throned the base o the mount
 is rank'd with all deserts all kind of natures
 that labour on the bosom of this sphere
 to propagate their states amongst them all
 whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd
 one do i personate of lord timon's frame
 whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her
 whose present grace to present slaves and servants
 translates his rivals
painter tis conceived to scope
 this throne this fortune and this hill methinks
 with one man beckon'd from the rest below
 bowing his head against the sleepy mount
 to climb his happiness would be well express'd
 in our condition
poet nay sir but hear me on
 all those which were his fellows but of late
 some better than his value on the moment
 follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance
 rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear
 make sacred even his stirrup and through him
 drink the free air
painter ay marry what of these
poet when fortune in her shift and change of mood
 spurns down her late beloved all his dependants
 which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
 even on their knees and hands let him slip down
 not one accompanying his declining foot
painter tis common
 a thousand moral paintings i can show
 that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune's
 more pregnantly than words yet you do well
 to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen
 the foot above the head
 trumpets sound enter timon addressing himself
 courteously to every suitor a messenger from
 ventidius talking with him lucilius and other
 servants following
timon imprison'd is he say you
messenger ay my good lord five talents is his debt
 his means most short his creditors most strait
 your honourable letter he desires
 to those have shut him up which failing
 periods his comfort
timon noble ventidius well
 i am not of that feather to shake off
 my friend when he must need me i do know him
 a gentleman that well deserves a help
 which he shall have i'll pay the debt
 and free him
messenger your lordship ever binds him
timon commend me to him i will send his ransom
 and being enfranchised bid him come to me
 tis not enough to help the feeble up
 but to support him after fare you well
messenger all happiness to your honour

 in different pleasures pray you let us in
 exeunt all except apemantus

apemantus the more accursed thou that still omitt'st it
second lord thou art going to lord timon's feast
apemantus ay to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools
second lord fare thee well fare thee well
apemantus thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice
second lord why apemantus
apemantus shouldst have kept one to thyself for i mean to
 give thee none
first lord hang thyself
apemantus no i will do nothing at thy bidding make thy
 requests to thy friend
second lord away unpeaceable dog or i'll spurn thee hence
apemantus i will fly like a dog the heels o the ass
 exit
first lord he's opposite to humanity come shall we in
 and taste lord timon's bounty he outgoes
 the very heart of kindness
second lord he pours it out plutus the god of gold
 is but his steward no meed but he repays
 sevenfold above itself no gift to him
 but breeds the giver a return exceeding
 all use of quittance
first lord the noblest mind he carries
 that ever govern'd man
second lord long may he live in fortunes shall we in
first lord i'll keep you company

 timon of athens
act i
scene ii a banquetingroom in timon's house
 hautboys playing loud music a great banquet
 served in flavius and others attending then enter
 timon alcibiades lords senators and ventidius
 then comes dropping after all apemantus
 discontentedly like himself
ventidius most honour'd timon
 it hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age
 and call him to long peace
 he is gone happy and has left me rich
 then as in grateful virtue i am bound
 to your free heart i do return those talents
 doubled with thanks and service from whose help
 i derived liberty
timon o by no means
 honest ventidius you mistake my love
 i gave it freely ever and there's none
 can truly say he gives if he receives
 if our betters play at that game we must not dare
 to imitate them faults that are rich are fair
ventidius a noble spirit
timon nay my lords
 they all stand ceremoniously looking on timon
 ceremony was but devised at first
 to set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes
 recanting goodness sorry ere tis shown
 but where there is true friendship there needs none
 pray sit more welcome are ye to my fortunes
 than my fortunes to me
 they sit
first lord my lord we always have confess'd it
apemantus ho ho confess'd it hang'd it have you not
timon o apemantus you are welcome
apemantus no
 you shall not make me welcome
 i come to have thee thrust me out of doors
timon fie thou'rt a churl ye've got a humour there
 does not become a man tis much to blame
 they say my lords ira furor brevis est but yond
 man is ever angry go let him have a table by
 himself for he does neither affect company nor is
 he fit for't indeed
apemantus let me stay at thine apperil timon i come to
 observe i give thee warning on't
timon i take no heed of thee thou'rt an athenian
 therefore welcome i myself would have no power
 prithee let my meat make thee silent
apemantus i scorn thy meat twould choke me for i should
 ne'er flatter thee o you gods what a number of
 men eat timon and he sees em not it grieves me
 to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood
 and all the madness is he cheers them up too
 i wonder men dare trust themselves with men
 methinks they should invite them without knives
 good for their meat and safer for their lives
 there's much example for't the fellow that sits
 next him now parts bread with him pledges the
 breath of him in a divided draught is the readiest
 man to kill him t has been proved if i were a
 huge man i should fear to drink at meals
 lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes
 great men should drink with harness on their throats
timon my lord in heart and let the health go round
second lord let it flow this way my good lord
apemantus flow this way a brave fellow he keeps his tides
 well those healths will make thee and thy state
 look ill timon here's that which is too weak to
 be a sinner honest water which ne'er left man i the mire
 this and my food are equals there's no odds
 feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods
 apemantus grace
 immortal gods i crave no pelf
 i pray for no man but myself
 grant i may never prove so fond
 to trust man on his oath or bond
 or a harlot for her weeping
 or a dog that seems asleeping
 or a keeper with my freedom
 or my friends if i should need em
 amen so fall to't
 rich men sin and i eat root
 eats and drinks
 much good dich thy good heart apemantus
timon captain alcibiades your heart's in the field now
alcibiades my heart is ever at your service my lord
timon you had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
 dinner of friends
alcibiades so the were bleedingnew my lord there's no meat
 like em i could wish my best friend at such a feast
apemantus would all those fatterers were thine enemies then
 that then thou mightst kill em and bid me to em
first lord might we but have that happiness my lord that you
 would once use our hearts whereby we might express
 some part of our zeals we should think ourselves
 for ever perfect
timon o no doubt my good friends but the gods
 themselves have provided that i shall have much help
 from you how had you been my friends else why
 have you that charitable title from thousands did
 not you chiefly belong to my heart i have told
 more of you to myself than you can with modesty
 speak in your own behalf and thus far i confirm
 you o you gods think i what need we have any
 friends if we should ne'er have need of em they
 were the most needless creatures living should we
 ne'er have use for em and would most resemble
 sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
 sounds to themselves why i have often wished
 myself poorer that i might come nearer to you we
 are born to do benefits and what better or
 properer can we can our own than the riches of our
 friends o what a precious comfort tis to have
 so many like brothers commanding one another's
 fortunes o joy e'en made away ere t can be born
 mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks to
 forget their faults i drink to you
apemantus thou weepest to make them drink timon
second lord joy had the like conception in our eyes
 and at that instant like a babe sprung up
apemantus ho ho i laugh to think that babe a bastard
third lord i promise you my lord you moved me much
apemantus much

timon they're welcome all let em have kind admittance
 music make their welcome
 exit cupid
first lord you see my lord how ample you're beloved
 music reenter cupid with a mask of ladies
 as amazons with lutes in their hands
 dancing and playing
apemantus hoyday what a sweep of vanity comes this way
 they dance they are mad women
 like madness is the glory of this life
 as this pomp shows to a little oil and root
 we make ourselves fools to disport ourselves
 and spend our flatteries to drink those men
 upon whose age we void it up again
 with poisonous spite and envy
 who lives that's not depraved or depraves
 who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
 of their friends gift
 i should fear those that dance before me now
 would one day stamp upon me t has been done
 men shut their doors against a setting sun
 the lords rise from table with much adoring of
 timon and to show their loves each singles out an
 amazon and all dance men with women a lofty
 strain or two to the hautboys and cease
timon you have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies
 set a fair fashion on our entertainment
 which was not half so beautiful and kind
 you have added worth unto t and lustre
 and entertain'd me with mine own device
 i am to thank you for t
first lady my lord you take us even at the best
apemantus faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold
 taking i doubt me

 not without fair reward
flavius aside what will this come to
 he commands us to provide and give great gifts
 and all out of an empty coffer
 nor will he know his purse or yield me this
 to show him what a beggar his heart is
 being of no power to make his wishes good
 his promises fly so beyond his state
 that what he speaks is all in debt he owes
 for every word he is so kind that he now
 pays interest for t his land's put to their books
 well would i were gently put out of office
 before i were forced out
 happier is he that has no friend to feed
 than such that do e'en enemies exceed
 i bleed inwardly for my lord
 exit
timon you do yourselves
 much wrong you bate too much of your own merits
 here my lord a trifle of our love
second lord with more than common thanks i will receive it
third lord o he's the very soul of bounty
timon and now i remember my lord you gave
 good words the other day of a bay courser
 i rode on it is yours because you liked it
second lord o i beseech you pardon me my lord in that
timon you may take my word my lord i know no man
 can justly praise but what he does affect
 i weigh my friend's affection with mine own
 i'll tell you true i'll call to you
all lords o none so welcome
timon i take all and your several visitations
 so kind to heart tis not enough to give
 methinks i could deal kingdoms to my friends
 and ne'er be weary alcibiades
 thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich
 it comes in charity to thee for all thy living

 lie in a pitch'd field

timon now apemantus if thou wert not sullen i would be
 good to thee
apemantus no i'll nothing for if i should be bribed too
 there would be none left to rail upon thee and then
 thou wouldst sin the faster thou givest so long
 timon i fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
 paper shortly what need these feasts pomps and
 vainglories
timon nay an you begin to rail on society once i am
 sworn not to give regard to you farewell and come
 with better music
 exit
apemantus so
 thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then

flavius pray you walk near i'll speak with you anon
 exeunt servants
timon you make me marvel wherefore ere this time
 had you not fully laid my state before me
 that i might so have rated my expense
 as i had leave of means
flavius you would not hear me
 at many leisures i proposed
timon go to
 perchance some single vantages you took
 when my indisposition put you back
 and that unaptness made your minister
 thus to excuse yourself
flavius o my good lord
 at many times i brought in my accounts
 laid them before you you would throw them off
 and say you found them in mine honesty
 when for some trifling present you have bid me
 return so much i have shook my head and wept
 yea gainst the authority of manners pray'd you
 to hold your hand more close i did endure
 not seldom nor no slight cheques when i have
 prompted you in the ebb of your estate
 and your great flow of debts my loved lord
 though you hear now too lateyet now's a time
 the greatest of your having lacks a half
 to pay your present debts
timon let all my land be sold
flavius tis all engaged some forfeited and gone
 and what remains will hardly stop the mouth
 of present dues the future comes apace
 what shall defend the interim and at length
 how goes our reckoning
timon to lacedaemon did my land extend
flavius o my good lord the world is but a word
 were it all yours to give it in a breath
 how quickly were it gone
timon you tell me true
flavius if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood
 call me before the exactest auditors
 and set me on the proof so the gods bless me
 when all our offices have been oppress'd
 with riotous feeders when our vaults have wept
 with drunken spilth of wine when every room
 hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy
 i have retired me to a wasteful cock
 and set mine eyes at flow
timon prithee no more
flavius heavens have i said the bounty of this lord
 how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
 this night englutted who is not timon's
 what heart head sword force means but is
 lord timon's
 great timon noble worthy royal timon
 ah when the means are gone that buy this praise
 the breath is gone whereof this praise is made
 feastwon fastlost one cloud of winter showers
 these flies are couch'd
timon come sermon me no further
 no villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart
 unwisely not ignobly have i given
 why dost thou weep canst thou the conscience lack
 to think i shall lack friends secure thy heart
 if i would broach the vessels of my love
 and try the argument of hearts by borrowing
 men and men's fortunes could i frankly use
 as i can bid thee speak
flavius assurance bless your thoughts
timon and in some sort these wants of mine are crown'd
 that i account them blessings for by these
 shall i try friends you shall perceive how you
 mistake my fortunes i am wealthy in my friends
 within there flaminius servilius
 enter flaminius servilius and other servants
servants my lord my lord
timon i will dispatch you severally you to lord lucius
 to lord lucullus you i hunted with his honour
 today you to sempronius commend me to their
 loves and i am proud say that my occasions have
 found time to use em toward a supply of money let
 the request be fifty talents
flaminius as you have said my lord
flavius aside lord lucius and lucullus hum
timon go you sir to the senators
 of whom even to the state's best health i have
 deserved this hearingbid em send o the instant
 a thousand talents to me
flavius i have been bold
 for that i knew it the most general way
 to them to use your signet and your name
 but they do shake their heads and i am here
 no richer in return
timon is't true can't be
flavius they answer in a joint and corporate voice
 that now they are at fall want treasure cannot
 do what they would are sorryyou are honourable
 but yet they could have wish'dthey know not
 something hath been amissa noble nature
 may catch a wrenchwould all were well'tis pity
 and so intending other serious matters
 after distasteful looks and these hard fractions
 with certain halfcaps and coldmoving nods
 they froze me into silence
timon you gods reward them
 prithee man look cheerly these old fellows
 have their ingratitude in them hereditary
 their blood is caked tis cold it seldom flows
 tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind
 and nature as it grows again toward earth
 is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy
 to a servant
 go to ventidius
 to flavius
 prithee be not sad
 thou art true and honest ingeniously i speak
 no blame belongs to thee
 to servant
 ventidius lately
 buried his father by whose death he's stepp'd
 into a great estate when he was poor
 imprison'd and in scarcity of friends
 i clear'd him with five talents greet him from me
 bid him suppose some good necessity
 touches his friend which craves to be remember'd
 with those five talents
 exit servant
 to flavius
 that had give't these fellows
 to whom tis instant due ne'er speak or think

flaminius faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my
 lord's behalf i come to entreat your honour to
 supply who having great and instant occasion to
 use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to
 furnish him nothing doubting your present
 assistance therein
lucullus la la la la nothing doubting says he alas
 good lord a noble gentleman tis if he would not
 keep so good a house many a time and often i ha'
 dined with him and told him on't and come again to
 supper to him of purpose to have him spend less

 bare friendship without security here's three
 solidares for thee good boy wink at me and say
 thou sawest me not fare thee well

flaminius may these add to the number that may scald thee
 let moulten coin be thy damnation
 thou disease of a friend and not himself
 has friendship such a faint and milky heart
 it turns in less than two nights o you gods

 unto his honour has my lord's meat in him
 why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
 when he is turn'd to poison
 o may diseases only work upon't
 and when he's sick to death let not that part of nature
 which my lord paid for be of any power
 to expel sickness but prolong his hour

 which i hear from common rumours now lord timon's
 happy hours are done and past and his estate
 shrinks from him
lucilius fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money
second stranger but believe you this my lord that not long ago
 one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow
 so many talents nay urged extremely for't and
 showed what necessity belonged to't and yet was denied
lucilius how
second stranger i tell you denied my lord
lucilius what a strange case was that now before the gods
 i am ashamed on't denied that honourable man
 there was very little honour showed in't for my own
 part i must needs confess i have received some
 small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels
 and suchlike trifles nothing comparing to his
 yet had he mistook him and sent to me i should
 ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents
 enter servilius
servilius see by good hap yonder's my lord
 i have sweat to see his honour my honoured lord
 to lucius
lucilius servilius you are kindly met sir fare thee well
 commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very
 exquisite friend
servilius may it please your honour my lord hath sent
lucilius ha what has he sent i am so much endeared to
 that lord he's ever sending how shall i thank
 him thinkest thou and what has he sent now
servilius has only sent his present occasion now my lord
 requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
 with so many talents
lucilius i know his lordship is but merry with me
 he cannot want fifty five hundred talents
servilius but in the mean time he wants less my lord
 if his occasion were not virtuous
 i should not urge it half so faithfully
lucilius dost thou speak seriously servilius
servilius upon my soul'tis true sir
lucilius what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself
 against such a good time when i might ha shown
 myself honourable how unluckily it happened that i
 should purchase the day before for a little part
 and undo a great deal of honoured servilius now
 before the gods i am not able to dothe more
 beast i sayi was sending to use lord timon
 myself these gentlemen can witness but i would
 not for the wealth of athens i had done't now
 commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i
 hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me
 because i have no power to be kind and tell him
 this from me i count it one of my greatest
 afflictions say that i cannot pleasure such an
 honourable gentleman good servilius will you
 befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him
servilius yes sir i shall
lucilius i'll look you out a good turn servilius
 exit servilius
 true as you said timon is shrunk indeed
 and he that's once denied will hardly speed
 exit
first stranger do you observe this hostilius
second stranger ay too well
first stranger why this is the world's soul and just of the
 same piece
 is every flatterer's spirit who can call him
 his friend that dips in the same dish for in
 my knowing timon has been this lord's father
 and kept his credit with his purse
 supported his estate nay timon's money
 has paid his men their wages he ne'er drinks
 but timon's silver treads upon his lip
 and yeto see the monstrousness of man
 when he looks out in an ungrateful shape
 he does deny him in respect of his
 what charitable men afford to beggars
third stranger religion groans at it
first stranger for mine own part
 i never tasted timon in my life
 nor came any of his bounties over me
 to mark me for his friend yet i protest
 for his right noble mind illustrious virtue
 and honourable carriage
 had his necessity made use of me
 i would have put my wealth into donation
 and the best half should have return'd to him
 so much i love his heart but i perceive
 men must learn now with pity to dispense
 for policy sits above conscience

act iii
scene iii a room in sempronius house
 enter sempronius and a servant of timon's
sempronius must he needs trouble me in thum'bove
 all others
 he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus
 and now ventidius is wealthy too
 whom he redeem'd from prison all these
 owe their estates unto him
servant my lord
 they have all been touch'd and found base metal for
 they have au denied him
sempronius how have they denied him
 has ventidius and lucullus denied him
 and does he send to me three hum
 it shows but little love or judgment in him
 must i be his last refuge his friends like
 physicians
 thrive give him over must i take the cure upon me
 has much disgraced me in't i'm angry at him
 that might have known my place i see no sense for't
 but his occasion might have woo'd me first
 for in my conscience i was the first man
 that e'er received gift from him
 and does he think so backwardly of me now
 that i'll requite its last no
 so it may prove an argument of laughter
 to the rest and mongst lords i be thought a fool
 i'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum
 had sent to me first but for my mind's sake
 i'd such a courage to do him good but now return
 and with their faint reply this answer join
 who bates mine honour shall not know my coin
 exit
servant excellent your lordship's a goodly villain the
 devil knew not what he did when he made man
 politic he crossed himself by t and i cannot
 think but in the end the villainies of man will
 set him clear how fairly this lord strives to
 appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked
 like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
 whole realms on fire of such a nature is his
 politic love
 this was my lord's best hope now all are fled
 save only the gods now his friends are dead
 doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
 many a bounteous year must be employ'd
 now to guard sure their master
 and this is all a liberal course allows
 who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house

scene iv the same a hall in timon's house
 enter two servants of varro and the servant of
 lucius meeting titus hortensius and other
 servants of timon's creditors waiting his coming out
varro's
first servant well met good morrow titus and hortensius
titus the like to you kind varro
hortensius lucius
 what do we meet together
lucilius servant ay and i think
 one business does command us all for mine is money
titus so is theirs and ours
 enter philotus
lucilius servant and sir philotus too
philotus good day at once
lucilius servant welcome good brother
 what do you think the hour
philotus labouring for nine
lucilius servant so much
philotus is not my lord seen yet
lucilius servant not yet
philotus i wonder on't he was wont to shine at seven
lucilius servant ay but the days are wax'd shorter with him
 you must consider that a prodigal course
 is like the sun's but not like his recoverable
 i fear tis deepest winter in lord timon's purse
 that is one may reach deep enough and yet
 find little
philotus i am of your fear for that
titus i'll show you how to observe a strange event
 your lord sends now for money
hortensius most true he does
titus and he wears jewels now of timon's gift
 for which i wait for money
hortensius it is against my heart
lucilius servant mark how strange it shows
 timon in this should pay more than he owes
 and e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
 and send for money for em
hortensius i'm weary of this charge the gods can witness
 i know my lord hath spent of timon's wealth
 and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth
varro's
first servant yes mine's three thousand crowns what's yours
lucilius servant five thousand mine
varro's
first servant tis much deep and it should seem by the sun
 your master's confidence was above mine
 else surely his had equall'd
 enter flaminius
titus one of lord timon's men
lucilius servant flaminius sir a word pray is my lord ready to
 come forth
flaminius no indeed he is not
titus we attend his lordship pray signify so much
flaminius i need not tell him that he knows you are too diligent
 exit
 enter flavius in a cloak muffled
lucilius servant ha is not that his steward muffled so
 he goes away in a cloud call him call him
titus do you hear sir
varro's
second servant by your leave sir
flavius what do ye ask of me my friend
titus we wait for certain money here sir
flavius ay
 if money were as certain as your waiting
 twere sure enough
 why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills
 when your false masters eat of my lord's meat
 then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
 and take down the interest into their
 gluttonous maws
 you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up
 let me pass quietly
 believe t my lord and i have made an end
 i have no more to reckon he to spend
lucilius servant ay but this answer will not serve
flavius if twill not serve'tis not so base as you
 for you serve knaves
 exit
varro's
first servant how what does his cashiered worship mutter
varro's
second servant no matter what he's poor and that's revenge
 enough who can speak broader than he that has no
 house to put his head in such may rail against
 great buildings
 enter servilius
titus o here's servilius now we shall know some answer
servilius if i might beseech you gentlemen to repair some
 other hour i should derive much from't for
 take't of my soul my lord leans wondrously to
 discontent his comfortable temper has forsook him
 he's much out of health and keeps his chamber
lucilius servant many do keep their chambers are not sick
 and if it be so far beyond his health
 methinks he should the sooner pay his debts
 and make a clear way to the gods
servilius good gods
titus we cannot take this for answer sir
flaminius within servilius help my lord my lord
 enter timon in a rage flaminius following
timon what are my doors opposed against my passage
 have i been ever free and must my house
 be my retentive enemy my gaol
 the place which i have feasted does it now
 like all mankind show me an iron heart
lucilius servant put in now titus
titus my lord here is my bill
lucilius servant here's mine
hortensius and mine my lord

act iii
scene v the same the senatehouse the senate sitting
first senator my lord you have my voice to it the fault's
 bloody tis necessary he should die
 nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy
second senator most true the law shall bruise him
 enter alcibiades with attendants
alcibiades honour health and compassion to the senate
first senator now captain
alcibiades i am an humble suitor to your virtues
 for pity is the virtue of the law
 and none but tyrants use it cruelly
 it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
 upon a friend of mine who in hot blood
 hath stepp'd into the law which is past depth
 to those that without heed do plunge into t
 he is a man setting his fate aside
 of comely virtues
 nor did he soil the fact with cowardice
 an honour in him which buys out his fault
 but with a noble fury and fair spirit
 seeing his reputation touch'd to death
 he did oppose his foe
 and with such sober and unnoted passion
 he did behave his anger ere twas spent
 as if he had but proved an argument
first senator you undergo too strict a paradox
 striving to make an ugly deed look fair
 your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
 to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
 upon the head of valour which indeed
 is valour misbegot and came into the world
 when sects and factions were newly born
 he's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
 the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs
 his outsides to wear them like his raiment
 carelessly
 and ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart
 to bring it into danger
 if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
 what folly tis to hazard life for ill
alcibiades my lord
first senator you cannot make gross sins look clear
 to revenge is no valour but to bear
alcibiades my lords then under favour pardon me
 if i speak like a captain
 why do fond men expose themselves to battle
 and not endure all threats sleep upon't
 and let the foes quietly cut their throats
 without repugnancy if there be
 such valour in the bearing what make we
 abroad why then women are more valiant
 that stay at home if bearing carry it
 and the ass more captain than the lion the felon
 loaden with irons wiser than the judge
 if wisdom be in suffering o my lords
 as you are great be pitifully good
 who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
 to kill i grant is sin's extremest gust
 but in defence by mercy tis most just
 to be in anger is impiety
 but who is man that is not angry
 weigh but the crime with this
second senator you breathe in vain
alcibiades in vain his service done
 at lacedaemon and byzantium
 were a sufficient briber for his life
first senator what's that
alcibiades i say my lords he has done fair service
 and slain in fight many of your enemies
 how full of valour did he bear himself
 in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds
second senator he has made too much plenty with em
 he's a sworn rioter he has a sin that often
 drowns him and takes his valour prisoner
 if there were no foes that were enough
 to overcome him in that beastly fury
 he has been known to commit outrages
 and cherish factions tis inferr'd to us
 his days are foul and his drink dangerous
first senator he dies
alcibiades hard fate he might have died in war
 my lords if not for any parts in him
 though his right arm might purchase his own time
 and be in debt to noneyet more to move you
 take my deserts to his and join em both
 and for i know your reverend ages love
 security i'll pawn my victories all
 my honours to you upon his good returns
 if by this crime he owes the law his life
 why let the war receive t in valiant gore
 for law is strict and war is nothing more
first senator we are for law he dies urge it no more
 on height of our displeasure friend or brother
 he forfeits his own blood that spills another
alcibiades must it be so it must not be my lords
 i do beseech you know me
second senator how
alcibiades call me to your remembrances
third senator what
alcibiades i cannot think but your age has forgot me
 it could not else be i should prove so base
 to sue and be denied such common grace
 my wounds ache at you
first senator do you dare our anger
 tis in few words but spacious in effect
 we banish thee for ever
alcibiades banish me
 banish your dotage banish usury
 that makes the senate ugly
first senator if after two days shine athens contain thee
 attend our weightier judgment and not to swell
 our spirit
 he shall be executed presently
 exeunt senators
alcibiades now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
 only in bone that none may look on you
 i'm worse than mad i have kept back their foes
 while they have told their money and let out
 their coin upon large interest i myself
 rich only in large hurts all those for this
 is this the balsam that the usuring senate
 pours into captains wounds banishment
 it comes not ill i hate not to be banish'd
 it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury
 that i may strike at athens i'll cheer up
 my discontented troops and lay for hearts
 tis honour with most lands to be at odds
 soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods

first lord the good time of day to you sir
second lord i also wish it to you i think this honourable lord
 did but try us this other day
first lord upon that were my thoughts tiring when we
 encountered i hope it is not so low with him as
 he made it seem in the trial of his several friends
second lord it should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting
first lord i should think so he hath sent me an earnest
 inviting which many my near occasions did urge me
 to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and
 i must needs appear
second lord in like manner was i in debt to my importunate
 business but he would not hear my excuse i am
 sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my
 provision was out
first lord i am sick of that grief too as i understand how all
 things go
second lord every man here's so what would he have borrowed of
 you
first lord a thousand pieces
second lord a thousand pieces

 that i returned you an empty messenger
timon o sir let it not trouble you
second lord my noble lord
timon ah my good friend what cheer
second lord my most honourable lord i am e'en sick of shame
 that when your lordship this other day sent to me
 i was so unfortunate a beggar

timon let it not cumber your better remembrance
 the banquet brought in
 come bring in all together

 places alike make not a city feast of it to let
 the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place

 thankfulness for your own gifts make yourselves
 praised but reserve still to give lest your
 deities be despised lend to each man enough that
 one need not lend to another for were your
 godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the
 gods make the meat be beloved more than the man

 the table let a dozen of them beas they are the
 rest of your fees o godsthe senators of athens

 let me be recorded by the righteous gods
 i am as poor as you
first servant such a house broke
 so noble a master fall'n all gone and not
 one friend to take his fortune by the arm
 and go along with him
second servant as we do turn our backs
 from our companion thrown into his grave
 so his familiars to his buried fortunes
 slink all away leave their false vows with him
 like empty purses pick'd and his poor self

 walks like contempt alone more of our fellows
 enter other servants
flavius all broken implements of a ruin'd house
third servant yet do our hearts wear timon's livery
 that see i by our faces we are fellows still
 serving alike in sorrow leak'd is our bark
 and we poor mates stand on the dying deck
 hearing the surges threat we must all part
 into this sea of air
flavius good fellows all
 the latest of my wealth i'll share amongst you
 wherever we shall meet for timon's sake
 let's yet be fellows let's shake our heads and say
 as twere a knell unto our master's fortunes
 we have seen better days let each take some
 nay put out all your hands not one word more
 thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor
 servants embrace and part several ways
 o the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us
 who would not wish to be from wealth exempt
 since riches point to misery and contempt
 who would be so mock'd with glory or to live
 but in a dream of friendship
 to have his pomp and all what state compounds
 but only painted like his varnish'd friends
 poor honest lord brought low by his own heart
 undone by goodness strange unusual blood
 when man's worst sin is he does too much good
 who then dares to be half so kind again
 for bounty that makes gods does still mar men
 my dearest lord bless'd to be most accursed
 rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes
 are made thy chief afflictions alas kind lord
 he's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
 of monstrous friends nor has he with him to
 supply his life or that which can command it

 for showing me again the eyes of man
alcibiades what is thy name is man so hateful to thee
 that art thyself a man
timon i am misanthropos and hate mankind
 for thy part i do wish thou wert a dog
 that i might love thee something
alcibiades i know thee well
 but in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange
timon i know thee too and more than that i know thee
 i not desire to know follow thy drum
 with man's blood paint the ground gules gules
 religious canons civil laws are cruel

 hath in her more destruction than thy sword
 for all her cherubim look
phrynia thy lips rot off
timon i will not kiss thee then the rot returns
 to thine own lips again
alcibiades how came the noble timon to this change
timon as the moon does by wanting light to give
 but then renew i could not like the moon
 there were no suns to borrow of
alcibiades noble timon
 what friendship may i do thee
timon none but to
 maintain my opinion
alcibiades what is it timon
timon promise me friendship but perform none if thou
 wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art
 a man if thou dost perform confound thee for
 thou art a man
alcibiades i have heard in some sort of thy miseries
timon thou saw'st them when i had prosperity
alcibiades i see them now then was a blessed time
timon as thine is now held with a brace of harlots
timandra is this the athenian minion whom the world
 voiced so regardfully
timon art thou timandra
timandra yes
timon be a whore still they love thee not that use thee
 give them diseases leaving with thee their lust
 make use of thy salt hours season the slaves
 for tubs and baths bring down rosecheeked youth
 to the tubfast and the diet
timandra hang thee monster
alcibiades pardon him sweet timandra for his wits
 are drown'd and lost in his calamities
 i have but little gold of late brave timon
 the want whereof doth daily make revolt
 in my penurious band i have heard and grieved
 how cursed athens mindless of thy worth
 forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states
 but for thy sword and fortune trod upon them
timon i prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone
alcibiades i am thy friend and pity thee dear timon
timon how dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble
 i had rather be alone
alcibiades why fare thee well
 here is some gold for thee
timon keep it i cannot eat it
alcibiades when i have laid proud athens on a heap
timon warr'st thou gainst athens
alcibiades ay timon and have cause
timon the gods confound them all in thy conquest
 and thee after when thou hast conquer'd
alcibiades why me timon
timon that by killing of villains
 thou wast born to conquer my country
 put up thy gold go onhere's goldgo on
 be as a planetary plague when jove
 will o'er some highviced city hang his poison
 in the sick air let not thy sword skip one
 pity not honour'd age for his white beard
 he is an usurer strike me the counterfeit matron
 it is her habit only that is honest
 herself's a bawd let not the virgin's cheek
 make soft thy trenchant sword for those milkpaps
 that through the windowbars bore at men's eyes
 are not within the leaf of pity writ
 but set them down horrible traitors spare not the babe
 whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy
 think it a bastard whom the oracle
 hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut
 and mince it sans remorse swear against objects
 put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes
 whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes
 nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding
 shall pierce a jot there's gold to pay soldiers
 make large confusion and thy fury spent
 confounded be thyself speak not be gone
alcibiades hast thou gold yet i'll take the gold thou
 givest me
 not all thy counsel
timon dost thou or dost thou not heaven's curse
 upon thee
phrynia 
 give us some gold good timon hast thou more
timandra 
timon enough to make a whore forswear her trade
 and to make whores a bawd hold up you sluts
 your aprons mountant you are not oathable
 although i know you ll swear terribly swear
 into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
 the immortal gods that hear youspare your oaths
 i'll trust to your conditions be whores still
 and he whose pious breath seeks to convert you
 be strong in whore allure him burn him up
 let your close fire predominate his smoke
 and be no turncoats yet may your pains six months
 be quite contrary and thatch your poor thin roofs
 with burthens of the deadsome that were hang'd
 no matterwear them betray with them whore still
 paint till a horse may mire upon your face
 a pox of wrinkles
phrynia 
 well more gold what then
timandra believe't that we'll do any thing for gold
timon consumptions sow
 in hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins
 and mar men's spurring crack the lawyer's voice
 that he may never more false title plead
 nor sound his quillets shrilly hoar the flamen
 that scolds against the quality of flesh
 and not believes himself down with the nose
 down with it flat take the bridge quite away
 of him that his particular to foresee
 smells from the general weal make curl'dpate
 ruffians bald
 and let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
 derive some pain from you plague all
 that your activity may defeat and quell
 the source of all erection there's more gold
 do you damn others and let this damn you
 and ditches grave you all
phrynia 
 more counsel with more money bounteous timon
timandra 
timon more whore more mischief first i have given you earnest
alcibiades strike up the drum towards athens farewell timon
 if i thrive well i'll visit thee again
timon if i hope well i'll never see thee more
alcibiades i never did thee harm
timon yes thou spokest well of me
alcibiades call'st thou that harm
timon men daily find it get thee away and take
 thy beagles with thee
alcibiades we but offend him strike
 drum beats exeunt alcibiades phrynia
 and timandra
timon that nature being sick of man's unkindness
 should yet be hungry common mother thou
 digging
 whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
 teems and feeds all whose selfsame mettle
 whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puff'd
 engenders the black toad and adder blue
 the gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm
 with all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
 whereon hyperion's quickening fire doth shine
 yield him who all thy human sons doth hate
 from forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root
 ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb
 let it no more bring out ingrateful man
 go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears
 teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
 hath to the marbled mansion all above
 never presentedo a rootdear thanks
 dry up thy marrows vines and ploughtorn leas
 whereof ungrateful man with liquorish draughts
 and morsels unctuous greases his pure mind
 that from it all consideration slips
 enter apemantus
 more man plague plague
apemantus i was directed hither men report
 thou dost affect my manners and dost use them
timon tis then because thou dost not keep a dog
 whom i would imitate consumption catch thee
apemantus this is in thee a nature but infected
 a poor unmanly melancholy sprung
 from change of fortune why this spade this place
 this slavelike habit and these looks of care
 thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft
 hug their diseased perfumes and have forgot
 that ever timon was shame not these woods
 by putting on the cunning of a carper
 be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive
 by that which has undone thee hinge thy knee
 and let his very breath whom thou'lt observe
 blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain
 and call it excellent thou wast told thus
 thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
 to knaves and all approachers tis most just
 that thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again
 rascals should have t do not assume my likeness
timon were i like thee i'ld throw away myself
apemantus thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself
 a madman so long now a fool what think'st
 that the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain
 will put thy shirt on warm will these moss'd trees
 that have outlived the eagle page thy heels
 and skip where thou point'st out will the
 cold brook
 candied with ice caudle thy morning taste
 to cure thy o'ernight's surfeit call the creatures
 whose naked natures live in an the spite
 of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks
 to the conflicting elements exposed
 answer mere nature bid them flatter thee
 o thou shalt find
timon a fool of thee depart
apemantus i love thee better now than e'er i did
timon i hate thee worse
apemantus why
timon thou flatter'st misery
apemantus i flatter not but say thou art a caitiff
timon why dost thou seek me out
apemantus to vex thee
timon always a villain's office or a fool's
 dost please thyself in't
apemantus ay
timon what a knave too
apemantus if thou didst put this sourcold habit on
 to castigate thy pride twere well but thou
 dost it enforcedly thou'ldst courtier be again
 wert thou not beggar willing misery
 outlives encertain pomp is crown'd before
 the one is filling still never complete
 the other at high wish best state contentless
 hath a distracted and most wretched being
 worse than the worst content
 thou shouldst desire to die being miserable
timon not by his breath that is more miserable
 thou art a slave whom fortune's tender arm
 with favour never clasp'd but bred a dog
 hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
 the sweet degrees that this brief world affords
 to such as may the passive drugs of it
 freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself
 in general riot melted down thy youth
 in different beds of lust and never learn'd
 the icy precepts of respect but follow'd
 the sugar'd game before thee but myself
 who had the world as my confectionary
 the mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men
 at duty more than i could frame employment
 that numberless upon me stuck as leaves
 do on the oak hive with one winter's brush
